Path to executables is configured with KALDI_ROOT variable in Kaldi recipes in path.sh script inside the recipe, for example, inside tidigits it is kaldi/egs/tidigits/s5/path.sh. The path specified is relative, so you must run commands from kaldi/egs/tidigits/s5 folder and not from other folder. There could be following problems

1.You didn't compile Kaldi and binary does not exist in kaldi/src/featbin
2.You moved the training folder from kaldi and you didn't update the KALDI_ROOT variable in path.sh
3.You run the command run.sh from some other folder, not from kaldi/egs/tidigits/s5 folder.
Usually you simply need to check contents of path.sh and specify the proper kaldi root there.
