I DON'T THINK SO
I WAS TOLD THAT MEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WERE AGAINST WOMEN'S EQUALITY
IT'S ALL A SCAM
ALL I HEARD WAS HE WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE
BUT I UNDERSTAND THEIR MINDSET
THE GROUND ZERO OF THE WAR ON WOMEN
SO I'M ASKING QUESTIONS AND I'M GETTING THEIR FULL LIFE STORY
THEY'RE ALL LYING ABOUT BEING ABUSED
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
THAT'S WHAT I DID
I SAID I'M GOING TO OPEN A THEATER
THIS IS WHAT THIS GROUP IS
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU DID SOMETHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU
AND I SPECIFICALLY LOVED ONE EXPERIENCE IN GENERAL WHICH WAS MY CLASS IMPROVISATION
NONE OF YOU CAME I'M OVER IT
THEY'RE FROM EUROPE
YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT HONEY BEES AREN'T NATIVE TO NORTH AMERICA
THEY NEED FOOD AS IN FLOWERS AND THEY NEED NESTING SIGHTS
THEY DON'T LIKE LAVENDER AND CLOVER
THIS IS A POEM ABOUT MARK ANTONY
IT'S MORE POWERFUL
THEY WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT A QUEER LITTLE BLACK BOY IN LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS
WHETHER IT'S SECULARIZED OR A SPIRITUAL ONE
I'M ALSO WORKING NOW WITH X RAY VIDEO
AND THIS IS QUITE A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT
AND I'M SURE THOSE ARCHITECTS ARE INSPIRED AS I AM BY WHAT SURROUNDS US BY NATURE
BUT ORGASM DIDN'T ACTUALLY EVOLVE UNTIL ABOUT 65 MILLION YEARS AGO WITH THE ADVENT OF MAMMALS
NOW WHEN HUMANS THINK ABOUT SEX MALE AND FEMALE FORMS ARE GENERALLY WHAT COME TO MIND BUT FOR MANY
IT'S SIMPLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNLESS THE FEMALE IS ON BOARD WITH THE ACTION
AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
SIMPLY INSERT PART A INTO SLOT B AND WE SHOULD ALL BE GOOD TO GO
BUT SOME ANIMALS HAD IT GOING ON QUITE A BIT BEFORE THAT
WOULD WE SEE 544 AIRLINE PILOTS HELD CAPTIVE IN THEIR JUMBO JETS ON A
THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO RELAX
THEY MAKE SKILLS MANIFEST
ALL HER STUDENTS WERE MARINES
WE'RE WITH YOU
WOULD THE RACIAL PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES BE WHAT THEY ARE
MAYBE YOU'RE FOR MAYBE YOU'RE AGAINST IT
ONCE THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY MODERATE THEIR
WHAT MAKES US SO PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR POSITIONS
I PURPOSELY PICKED THIS EXAMPLE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT GMO IT'S A HOT
WE TEND TO TAKE THESE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES AND WE SEE THEM
NO I'M SORRY NOT EXPLAIN IT BUT PROVIDE REASONS FOR IT
DON'T THINK TOO HARD ABOUT IT JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR SENSE IS OKAY
YOU ASK PEOPLE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN
WHEN YOU SEE A CLOUD FROM A DISTANCE WHAT DO YOU SEE
OUR LEADERS ARE INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR POSITIONS AND SO ARE WE
THAT'S THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN STUDYING IN MY LAB
WHAT I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO DO THOUGH IS TO THINK ABOUT IT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND
WE THINK WE'RE RIGHT
EXPLAIN HOW A TOILET WORKS
THEY NEEDED WHAT THOSE WOMEN COULD BRING TO THE TABLE
WHEN I ARRIVED I GOT TO EAT ALL OF MY FAVORITE FOODS
THEY ARE MORE CONFIDENT
THEIR REASONS WERE VARIED BUT THEIR REASONS WERE VERY REAL
THE TWO OF US WOULD SPEND HOURS TRYING TO PUT IT TOGETHER WHILE WE CHATTED COMFORTABLY
MAKE IT IN ANY ONE OF FIVE FOCUS AREAS
AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
WHY ARE THEY VULNERABLE
SO HERE'S THE WORD
AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS
THE BABIES AT THE HIGH END ARE VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY GOT TOO MUCH NUTRITION AND THAT'S ALMOST
IS THEY CAUSE AN INFLAMMATORY REACTION THAT'S VERY LOW GRADE AND THEY MAKE THOSE PEOPLE
THOSE BABIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY ARE VULNERABLE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE
THAT CAN BE FOR LOTS OF REASONS
HOWEVER WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS EPIGENETICS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT BEFORE YOU'RE BORN
NOW WHAT ABOUT THE BABIES AT THE HIGH END
I HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY IT SO YOU WILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME TEAM THAT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR WORLD
5 BILLION DOLLAR GALILEO MISSION TO JUPITER TWO HIGH PROFILE SCIENTIFIC
WILLIAMS AT UC HASTINGS REPORTED FACING RACIALIZED GENDER BIAS
NATIVE EYES ON NATIVE NAMES WE CALLED IT THE IDEA BEING WHO BEST TO TELL YOU WHO WAS IMPORTANT TO
WE HAD TO CALM THEM DOWN
THEY THOUGHT THE STORY WAS GOING TO GET OUT
SO I HAD TO BASICALLY SPEND THE LAST WEEK CALMING EVERYONE DOWN A BIT LIKE A GENERAL WHERE YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR TROOPS BACK
THEY ALL NEEDED TO BE HOUSED IN A SAFE AND SECURE LOCATION IN THE CLOUD
ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH CRISES ARE GLOBAL
NOW WHEN YOU'RE AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND YOU MAKE AN AMAZING DISCOVERY SUCH AS YOUR PRIME MINSTER CAN BE LINKED TO A
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY'D SPENT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES MONEY SPENT ON THIS
INDEED WE COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR ASKING OURSELVES
OKAY WE CAN DO THAT
WE DO ACHIEVE MORE IN GAME WORLDS
AND SO RECENTLY SCIENTISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HERODOTUS' CRAZY STORY IS ACTUALLY TRUE
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE
THEY NEVER GIVE YOU A CHALLENGE YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE
FIVE MILLION PEOPLE USE IT EVERY MONTH
NOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY RIGHT
THIS IS A GAMER ON THE VERGE OF AN EPIC WIN
THAT'S AN EPIC WIN
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS IN GAMES
SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT
BUT IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS AN OPTIMAL SITUATION
SO IN YOUR COMPANIES YOU CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL INVOICE AND SO YOU HAVE TO
AND I BELIEVE THE WAY WE MAKE CIVICS SEXY AGAIN IS TO MAKE EXPLICITLY ABOUT THE TEACHING OF
THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS
END OF STORY
ALL OF THESE FORM OF POWER ARE AT PLAY
AND THAT CAN BE MONEY OF COURSE IT CAN BE MONEY
AND THAT'S THE CASE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOWADAYS
SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT THE MORE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE MORE CHANCE YOU HAVE OF YOUR NAME BEING IN THAT KIND OF
THAT CAN BE A FASHION STATEMENT OR IT CAN BE A STATEMENT ABOUT THE KIND OF MUSIC THEY ARE INTO OR PERHAPS A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW MUCH
WE HAVE THIS VERY LITERAL WAY OF THINKING OF WHEN I DO CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORK I DO IT FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY
THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT MAKES A STATEMENT
I DO SOMETIMES BUT IT'S VERY RARE I NORMALLY USE MY MOBILE PHONE OR MY LAPTOP OR
I THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT
THIS IS REALLY GONNA WORK
BUT THE BIGGEST THING I LEARNED IS YOU HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT KIND OF MARKET RESEARCH OKAY
IT'S HUMAN NATURE RIGHT
IN CASE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BIG GRAND STATEMENTS THAT WE USED TO HEAR WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER
I DON'T REALLY USE MY WATCH TO TELL THE TIME
AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING TO DO
IT'S FANTASTIC GO FOR IT
SO WE RISK SEEING THE PRESS UNABLE TO DO THEIR JOB THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S
SUDDENLY AFTER YEARS OF CLAIMING IT WAS VITAL TO THEIR CASE THE GOVERNMENT DROPPED THEIR DEMANDS TO RISEN
AND ALONG THE WAY HE BECAME THE FACE FOR THE US GOVERNMENT'S RECENT PATTERN OF PROSECUTING WHISTLEBLOWERS AND
AND I REALIZED HOW BLESSED I WAS TO HAVE HIM IN MY LIFE
IT'S FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
SO WE HAD TO HUG EVERYBODY BEFORE WE WENT OUTSIDE TO PLAY
THE SAPARA FREELY PROVIDE THEIR TREATMENTS TO ANYONE THE
AND WHY I IMAGE THE WINDS IS BECAUSE THEY REMIND ME OF OUR CONNECTION TO EVERYTHING AS
AND SLEEPILY WE'D GET BACK IN THE CAR AND GO BACK TO THE CITY
WE ARE PART OF SPIRIT GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER
WE'D PULL UP IN FRONT OF MY AUNT AND UNCLE'S HOUSE WITH ITS WHITE WOODED SIDING
FOR MILES THEY TRAVEL TO CUT THE TREES DOWN TO BUILD THEIR HOMES
THESE ARE SOLID GRANITE CURBS THAT WILL GO IN ON THE CORNERS OF THE STREETS
THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH THE WINTER THROUGH THE COLD WEATHER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAPPENS QUICKLY
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU REPLACED THE WORD COW WITH THE WORD HUMAN IT STILL MAKES PERFECT SENSE
ONCE WE WENT OUT TO TIME SQUARE AND WE STOOD AT ONE END AND WE LOOKED ACROSS TIME SQUARE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
AND NOBODY REALLY NOTICED IT BECAUSE MOST EVERYONE THINKS OF IT AS IT IS FLAT
SO WHY IS IT THAT THOSE TWO PLACES ARE SO DIFFERENT
WHICH IS ALSO IMPORTANT
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S IN THE SAME BOAT
AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ALLOW THEM TO FEEL SAFE OR COMFORTABLE
THERE'S A WONDERFUL THESE ARE DAYLIGHT SUNLIGHT STUDIES WE MADE OF TIME SQUARE
OF COURSE WE'RE SEEING ALL KINDS OF ODD THINGS
SO OVERVIEW OF THE SPACES ALONG BROADWAY HERE WITH 7TH AVENUE STILL HAVING TRAFFIC
WHICH IS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE TO HAVE
AND WE MOVE IN MANY WAYS LIKE LIVESTOCK
WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER
AND THAT'S WHERE THE RAIN WATER PUDDLES ACTUALLY APPEAR
THEY'RE BEING LAID NOW AND IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY
THE SPACE BETWEEN THINGS
AND PERHAPS MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER PROJECT OF OURS WHERE THIS HAS A SPECIAL MEANING IS OUR RECONSTRUCTION
I ALWAYS LAUGHED WHENEVER I READ A TEMPLE GRANDIN BOOK
BUT WE WANTED TO REFLECT THAT LIGHT INTO THE GROUND
IT'S A GREAT TEAM WORKING OUT THERE
WHEREAS IF YOU ASK SOMEONE FROM NEBRASKA THEY THINK IT'S THE MOST AMAZING THING ON EARTH
I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FUN
WE'RE MICRO GRADING AREAS TO REMOVE THE DRAINAGE PROBLEM
WE HATE TO ADMIT IT BECAUSE WE THINK WE'RE ABOVE ALL THAT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ACTUALLY RESPOND IN A VERY POSITIVE
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I WAS IN CHINA
WE CREATE LIVES FOR OURSELVES THAT ARE DOMESTIC
AND WE THOUGHT TO DO THAT AT TIME SQUARE
WE THEN THOUGHT TO OURSELVES HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IT'S GREAT IN THIS MOMENT WHEN I RECOGNIZE THAT HE PUT VALUE IN
WE'RE ACTUALLY INCREASING THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE WE'RE REMOVING TRAFFIC LIGHTS FROM TIME SQUARE
SO I FOUND A LITTLE FRUIT STAND ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
SO WHAT TAKES THE PLACE OF THAT HEALTHY SUPPORT SYSTEM NOW OUT OF REACH
DON'T ASSUME THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S STORY DOESN'T HAVE VALUE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEASURE UP TO
SETTING ASIDE THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AID IN OVERCOMING ADVERSITY MOST PEOPLE COME
THAT HAPPENED THE DAY SOMEONE CALLED ME A MANIPULATOR
WE TALKED ABOUT WRITING NEW POLICIES RELAXING THE RULES OF EXISTING POLICY OR CREATING NEW
NOW I DIDN'T SIT DOWN ONE DAY AND WRITE A LIST OF MY BESTIES AND MOMS JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE TOP
AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR ME WAS ARTICULATING THIS CONCEPT OF REHABILITATION SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS
EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN THAT MODEL FOR SOMEONE ELSE LIVES HAVE CHANGED
AND WHY DID MY STORY CIRCLE AROUND HERS
OKAY BESIDES NORMAN BATES
BUT WHAT IF WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE NATURE OF CHOICE MAKING ALL WRONG
AFTER SHE WAS GONE I EVEN QUESTIONED THE VALUE OF HER LIFE SO WHILE HER DEATH WRUNG OUT MY HEART
I JUST MISSED HER
REHABILITATION AS AN OPERATIVE DEFINITION THAT IS PEOPLE CENTERED RATHER THAN SYSTEM CENTERED
WHY WERE MY LIFE'S GREATEST LESSONS PREDICATED ON HER PAIN
CRACKED SIDEWALKS BE DAMNED
AND TRULY IN THAT MOMENT THAT WOMAN AND EVERY WOMAN LIKE HER BECAME MY MOTHER
LIKE THE HYSTERIA OF OLD THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH GENDER AND WITH WHOSE STORIES WE BELIEVE
BUT IT GAVE ME HOPE THAT I COULD BE TREATED
I HAD A SICK BODY THAT WAS ALL
WHAT WAS STRIKING WAS JUST HOW MUCH TROUBLE WE WERE HAVING BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY
IT IS A PERFECT CUSTOM PRISON
AND IN NORWAY RESEARCHERS ARE RUNNING A PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL ON A CANCER DRUG THAT IN SOME PATIENTS
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS CAN CAUSE REAL HARM
BUT WHAT IF WE MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO REVERSE THIS TREND
IF I NAME YOU I ASSUME YOU DON'T HAVE A NAME FOR YOURSELF OR IF YOU DO I DON'T CARE
I'M SHOWING UP AS A LISTENER
I BELIEVE THAT THAT ONE SIMPLE ACT HAS THE POWER TO ENHANCE OUR INDIVIDUAL WELL BEING AND IMPROVE OUR CHANCES FOR
IT'S BASIC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
FORMAL CHOIRS AND BACKYARD JAMS RECORDING SESSIONS AND BAND PRACTICES
WHAT IF WE SURROUNDED OUR SCHOOLS WITH NATIVE PLANTS WHICH ATTRACTED NATIVE ANIMALS WHICH CREATED
WHO KNOWS HOW FAR WE COULD GO IF WE FUNDED AND CELEBRATED OUR LISTENERS AS MUCH OR MORE THAN OUR SPEECH
WE KEEP DOING IT
BUT THIS WAS ALSO THE END OF A 7 YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DAWN WALL
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WITH 2 FRIENDS HAD HELICOPTERED INTO A REMOTE MOUNTAIN REGION IN SOUTHWEST KYRGYZSTAN
ON OUR 8TH DAY WE WOKE TO GUNSHOTS HUNTERS I THOUGHT
MY SISTER WAS 6 I WAS TWO AND A HALF AND STILL IN DIAPERS AND WE WERE SLEEPING IN A SNOW CAVE DEEP IN
I NOTICED MY NIGHT VISION IMPROVING
AS IT GOT DARK 2 OF OUR CAPTORS FORCED US TO DROP EVERYTHING AND RUN WITH THEM
I WAS AWARE OF EVERY SOUND EVERY MOVEMENT
WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
MANY SELFIES MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF EXPERTISE OR NOT HAVE A BLUR WITHIN THE IMAGE ITSELF
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO SIT THROUGH TWO HOURS OF NOT INTERACTING
AND HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL VERY EFFECTIVE INSTEAD OF FIGHTING WITH IT ROLL WITH IT AND LEVERAGE THAT
AND ALL THAT IS REALLY CUTE RIGHT
TEENAGERS DON'T DRIVE THE WAY THEY USED TO
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS AMAZING GOOGLE GLASS GAME CALLED ZOMBIES RUN
THEIR CARE'S THE ENVIRONMENT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE THINGS THAT I DO IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO KNOW I'M MAKING PROGRESS AND I WANT
AND GAMIFICATION IS THE PLATFORM WE'LL USE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
YOU KNOW THAT IN THE UNITED STATES FOUR FIFTHS OF THE POPULATION WATCHED BROADCAST ENTERTAINMENT LIKE A TV SHOW
WE'RE AT A MOMENT IN TIME IN LIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE CREATION OF CONTENT
I SAID WHAT'S IT ABOUT
THEY WANT TO COME AND DECIDE THE OUTCOME
NOT YOU OKAY NOT YOU BUT YOU
BUT IN PRACTICE THEY WANT YOU TO GIVE THEM THE ENTERTAINMENT
THEY DON'T WANT TO ANYMORE
IF YOU TEXT MY MOM RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE LIKE
AND BASICALLY THE WAY THIS GAME IS PLAYED
OKAY YOU LOVE THIS
HOW DOES THE LIVE PERFORMANCE INDUSTRY RESPOND TO SOCIAL MEDIA
I DON'T ONLY WANT TO CONSUME THE NUGGETS YOU'VE GIVEN ME IF I'M REALLY INTO THE THING YOU'RE MAKING I WANT TO CONSUME AS MUCH OF IT AS
HEY GABE'S MOM WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IT JUST DEPENDS
JUST LIKE YOU MAY BE A PART OF A TRIBE IF YOU REALLY LIKE SONDHEIM MUSICALS
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE 45 YOU STILL WANT CHALLENGING YOU STILL WANT THE CONTENT YOU WANT YOU STILL WANT TO FEEL CONNECTED TO THE
ANYTIME YOU CHALLENGE YOURSELF TO SOMETHING ANYTHING NO MATTER HOW BIG OR HOW SMALL AND YOU ACHIEVE THAT THING YOUR
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THAT THOUGH THEY'D LIKE TO BE MORE VISCERALLY INVOLVED
THIS GAME REPLACES THE SOARING INSPIRATIONAL VIDEO ON HOW DOMINO'S USES ONLY THE FRESHEST
NOW WE DON'T HAVE DISCIPLINE WE HAVE OCD
WE'VE GOT VOTING IN REALITY TELEVISION
AND THIS IS CORE TO GAMIFICATION
WHAT ARE THE REAL BUSINESS EFFECTS OF THIS
THEY DON'T WANT TO DRIVE A CAR OR SPEND MONEY ON A CAR BUT THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY DRIVING RATES HAVE FALLEN OFF A
I'M NOT GOING TO POSITION THIS THAT WAY AT ALL
THEY SAID THE RESEARCH CLASSIC MILLENNIAL STUFF
THEY'RE PROVIDING A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON THE LIVE EXPERIENCE
NATURE HAS BEEN DOING THAT FOR A LONG TIME
NONE OF THESE ARE USING THE ORGANISMS
AND THAT INFORMATION WILL GO INTO ASKNATURE
IT'S KIND OF A FORWARD OSMOSIS
IT WAS SO ARCHITECTURAL
AND THEY'RE HAVING APPLIANCES IN YOUR HOME TALK TO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THAT ALGORITHM AND
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A DREAM
WE WENT TO SOME LIVE FIGHTS
LIFE ISN'T ABOUT JUST TRYING TO BE HAPPY
SO HOW EVERY SINGLE ATOM THAT MAKES UP YOU AND ME WAS FORMED IN THE BELLY OF A SUN
I JUST EAT LITERALLY LIKE A VAT OF BROWN RICE AND POTATOES AND LIKE MORE BREAD ON
BUT WHEN I DID COME OUT OF IT I REALIZED THAT KIND OF SUPPORT DOESN'T EXIST FOR OTHER PEOPLE WITH CF
PEOPLE WITH CF CAN'T ACTUALLY BE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER
SOMETHING THAT WOULD GENUINELY HELP THEM THROUGH THEIR EXPERIENCE
MAYBE I CAN'T CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING INTO THE WORLD BECAUSE I GENUINELY LIKE AM NOT
I WAS DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO GRAB ONTO
SO PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS END UP HAVING TO TAKE OFF LONG PERIODS OF WORK TO BE ABLE TO
WELL YOU'D START BY FINDING OUT IF THE BIOTECH IS REALLY THERE
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE SUBJECT TO GO PUBLIC
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT
WHERE WOULD YOU START
IT HAPPENED TO LOTS OF MAMMALS
THEN THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU REASSEMBLE WITH THAT GENOME THE WHOLE BIRD
YOU KNOW DO YOU WANT EXTINCT SPECIES BACK
THE WINDS ARE TOO STRONG IT WOULD BE BLOWN AWAY
THIS IS ONE OF X'S MANTRAS
I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR TEENAGERS TO HAVE SEX
THEY OFFER PUBLIC TRAILS PLACES FOR SPIRITUAL PRACTICE PLACES FOR
THIS PROCEDURE DRAINS YOUR BLOOD AND REPLACES IT WITH A TOXIC CANCER CAUSING
I WAS AT WESTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AT THEIR BODY FARM MORE ACCURATELY CALLED A
BUT IT WILL MAKE BOLD MOVES IN HOW WE SEE OURSELVES AS CITIZENS OF THIS PLANET
NO REALLY I CAN'T
BUT IF YOU'RE RECOMPOSED IF YOU ACTUALLY BECOME THE SOIL YOU CAN NOURISH THE TREE AND BECOME THE POST
FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS I'VE WORKED IN THE FUNERAL INDUSTRY FIRST AS A CREMATORY OPERATOR
I WAS THERE BECAUSE A COLLEAGUE OF MINE NAMED KATRINA SPADE IS ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A SYSTEM NOT OF
I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE STARTING TO GET THE SENSE THAT OUR CURRENT FUNERAL INDUSTRY
WE'RE WASTING ALL OF THESE RESOURCES CONCRETES METAL HARDWOODS HIDING THEM IN VAST
FOR MANY OF US BEING SANITIZED AND BEAUTIFIED JUST DOESN'T REFLECT US
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THERE WERE 12 BODIES LAID OUT IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION
THEY'LL PUT IT IN A SUIT
SO LET'S RETURN TO THE IDEA OF PROTECTION SANITATION AND BEAUTIFICATION
WE'LL START WITH A DEAD BODY
THE DEAD THEN BLEND SEAMLESSLY IN WITH THE LANDSCAPE
AT THE CEMETERY ON THE DAY OF BURIAL THAT CASKET WILL BE LOWERED INTO A LARGE CONCRETE OR METAL
ACCEPTING THE FACT THAT WE ARE ANIMALS HAS SOME POTENTIALLY TERRIFYING CONSEQUENCES
IT DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT WE STOOD FOR DURING OUR LIVES
WILL CHANGING THE WAY WE BURY OUR DEAD SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE
IN AMERICA OUR DEATH TRADITIONS HAVE COME TO BE CHEMICAL EMBALMING FOLLOWED
IN A TRADITIONAL CREMATION THE ASHES THAT ARE LEFT OVER INORGANIC BONE FRAGMENTS FORM A
THEY'LL PUT IT IN MAKEUP
THE GRAVES ARE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PROPERTY UNDER ELEGANT MOUNDS MARKED ONLY BY A ROCK OR A
IT'S A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND ITS ECONOMIC MODEL IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF
IN FACT IT'S LIKELY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK
THE FUNERAL INDUSTRY WILL PROTECT YOUR DEAD BODY BY OFFERING TO SELL YOUR FAMILY A CASKET
HOW COULD I MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY ARE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME NOT JUST LISTENING BUT ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTING
MORE PEOPLE THAN HAD EVER SEEN ME PLAY IN ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE COMBINED
BACK IN 2006 I DECIDED TO HAVE SOME FUN ONE DAY AND AS AN EXPERIMENT I RECORDED MYSELF PLAYING A
BY UTILIZING STREAMING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIVITY I WAS ABLE TO CREATE A SPACE
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT
AND ONE STUDY ACTUALLY PUT FIGURES ON THAT SO IT LOOKED AT CHILDREN GROWING UP IN PERSISTENT POVERTY AND HOW WELL THEY WERE
I'VE GOT THREE BOYS THEY'RE THREE NINE AND 12
MANY CHILDREN IN THIS STUDY WERE BORN INTO POOR FAMILIES OR INTO WORKING CLASS FAMILIES THAT HAD CRAMPED
IN ONE STUDY SCIENTISTS LOOKED AT ABOUT 17000 CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN IN 1970
NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE ANSWERS AREN'T QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT
DID IT WORK
WE HAD A LITTLE BOY
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE TALENTS AND IDEAS THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE BUT IT STARTS WHEN WE LISTEN TO
YOU COULD SUPPORT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOU WOULD BE HAPPY
SO THERE IS NO TRADITIONAL BULLYING ROTA WHERE YOU GO HOME AT NIGHT AND
AND YES IT'S ALL SCRIPTED BY THE WAY EVEN THIS RELAXED OFF THE CUFF' BIT HAS BEEN PEER
WE'RE PROJECTING A VERSION OF OURSELVES ONTO THE INTERNET
WHICH AGAIN TECHNICAL TERM FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT THAT TECHNICAL
WE HAVE ACCESS TO 4G TABLETS SMARTPHONES LAPTOPS
I THANKED HER ASSUMING IT WAS FAKE LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE FOR SALE IN DONGGUAN
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN I SAVE
I DON'T WANT AN AD IN THE NEW YORKER AND MOST OF THESE WORKERS DON'T REALLY WANT IPHONES
BRONNIE WAS A PALLIATIVE CARE NURSE SO THESE AREN'T HER REGRETS OF DYING
SHE WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN SHE HAD
HE SAID TO THE FISHERMAN HOW MANY FISH DID YOU CATCH
I WISH I'D LET MYSELF BE HAPPIER
THERE'S A BOOK OUT AT THE MOMENT CALLED THE FIVE REGRETS OF DYING BY AUSTRALIAN AUTHOR BRONNIE WARE
IT'S GOT HEALTH BENEFITS
BUT NOWADAYS THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN BE SO THE PRINCESS REALLY IS AN IDEOLOGY
AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS GUARANTEED IN LIFE
IT IS GOING TO TAKE GENERATIONS TO CHANGE
BUT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TANGIBLE GIVING
THIS ORGANIZATION IS A LOT BIGGER THAN ANY I'VE EVER WORKED FOR MAYBE I NEED TO BE MORE SERIOUS
BUT I CAME HOME AND I SAW HIM SHORTLY BEFORE HE DIED
I MEAN WHEN THE PRINCE FOUND THE GLASS SLIPPER CINDERELLA DIDN'T RACE TO THE PALACE DEMANDING TO
THE SECOND ONE
I BLAME TIME
THE EVIL QUEEN HOWEVER RESORTED TO POISONING SNOW WHITE TO TRY AND GET HER HAPPY ENDING WHICH WE
WE ALL KNOW THE SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BAD TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY SHORT TERM
I DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS AND IT'S HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE
THEY ARE THE ORAL TEXTBOOKS OF THE CULTURE DESIGNED TO IMPART WISDOM SPIRITUALITY
YOU KNOW THIS PERSON IN THE WORKFORCE
HE SAID JUST A FEW
FOR ME WHEN I FIRST GOT THE JOB I'M IN AT THE MOMENT THE CHANCELLOR CAME UP TO ME BEFORE I STARTED AND SAID
IT LOWERS ANXIETY IT LOWERS STRESS IT IMPROVES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY INCREASING YOUR WHITE BLOOD CELLS
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT WE SEEM TO WEAR IT LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR
IT'S REALLY NICE ISN'T IT
ALL I WANTED TO DO IS TELL HIM HOW MUCH I LOVED HIM AND WHAT AN AMAZING FRIEND HE WAS
THE REALITY IS IN THE DECADE TODAY IT'S NOT GOING TO CUT IT
HAVE WE REALLY JUST SET UP THESE SERIES OF EXPECTATIONS FOR OURSELVES AND WHO'S JUDGING US
IF YOU NEVER THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE HAPPY
SHE WAS VERY VERY CONTENT
IT'S NOT ABOUT FINDING A HANDSOME PRINCE
I MEAN HE REALLY WAS JUST A MINOR CHARACTER IN ALL OF THE FAIRY TALES
THEY WERE PROUD ABOUT WHAT THEY DID SO SOMETIMES WE NEED TO STOP LOOKING FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION
THE GOOD THING IS THAT SMILING ACTUALLY HAS SOME GREAT BENEFITS
THEY'RE ALWAYS MISERABLE IT'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT THEY'RE REALLY CONFRONTATIONAL AND THEY'RE ALWAYS THE VICTIM
I HEARD OF A STORY RECENTLY WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD DEPICTION OF THIS
IF WE LOOK AT SNOW WHITE SHE HAD TO CLEAN THE HOUSE OF SEVEN STINKY COAL MINERS AND AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S HARD ENOUGH
AND SECONDLY IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A PRINCESS
THEY COULD BE SO MUCH MORE IF THEY JUST CONSIDERED PEOPLE AROUND THEM
THEY'RE MORE THAN JUST MYTHS LEGENDS AND FABLES
FOR ME I THINK WE MAY HAVE LOST SIGHT OF WHERE IT ALL STARTED
SO SOMETIMES TRYING TO FORCE YOURSELF OFF YOUR PATH CAN ACTUALLY PUT YOU ONTO THE WRONG
YOU FEEL GOOD THEY FEEL GOOD
IF WE LOOK AT CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD EVERY CULTURE READS STORIES
WHEN I WAS IN MY 20S A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER AND I WAS LIVING AWAY
IT'S ABOUT MAKING OTHER PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE
ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE WERE COMFORTABLE WITH AS WOMEN IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE LEARNED AND WE
OF COURSE I TURN UP TO THE WORK ON THE FIRST DAY WITH THIS INTENTION TO BE MORE SERIOUS AND BY LUNCHTIME I WAS
BUT WHAT IF WE WERE ALREADY GIVEN THE MAP TO HAPPINESS BUT LIFE GOT IN THE WAY AND WE FORGOT
THESE ARE THE REGRETS SHE HEARS FROM HER PATIENTS AT THEIR HOUR OF DEATH
THE FIRST REGRET
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I BLAME
I THOUGHT OH MY GOD MAYBE HE'S RIGHT
HE WAS THE OUTCOME OF HAPPINESS NOT THE SOURCE
IS IT SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THEIR MERIT
IF YOU ARE TOLD WHAT MATTERS IS YOUR APPEARANCE AND YOU ARE OFTEN NOT RECOGNISED FOR TRYING FOR TAKING A
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT OK FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
NEXT TIME YOU SEE A PARENT OR A TEACHER OR ANYONE INTERACTING WITH A YOUNG STUDENT THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY
I CERTAINLY SIT LIKE THIS USUALLY WITH MY THIGHS OVER MY HANDS
THE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHANGE THEM IS BECAUSE WE ARE LIMITING OUR POOL OF INNOVATION BY NEARLY 50 AND WE HAVE
THIS TIME THE RESULTS WERE REVERSED PEOPLE LIKED THE WOMAN MORE
I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE INTERVENTION NEEDS TO BEGIN
IF THERE ARE THREE THINGS I HOPE YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IT IS ONE
THEY HESITATE MORE
AND THAT THEY MUST HAVE CONSEQUENCES
IN ORDER TO SEE THESE PHENOMENA COME OUT IN AN INTERVIEW TYPE SETTING DR
WHY YOU DID NOT LIKE THAT APPLICANT OR WHY YOU LOVED THAT APPLICANT
BUT THE MAN WAS CONSIDERED WEAK INCOMPETENT
WE ARE TAUGHT THAT FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
AS MEN AND WOMEN THERE ARE EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW WE WILL ACT IN SOCIETY IN ORDER FOR IT TO RUN
THEY SAY LESS
THINK ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU ARE ON A HIRING COMMITTEE
IT IS LITERALLY A PHYSICALLY COMPACTING POSITION
THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT EACH OF YOU TODAY CAN BEGIN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM
OR HOW DOES THE COMPUTER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PRESS PLAY' HOW DOES IT KNOW WHICH VIDEO TO
AND WHAT IF
LITTLE GIRLS ARE AMAZING
YOUR MONEY CAN BE STOLEN
IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST FIVE YEARS IT'S LONG TERM INVESTMENTS
THEY HAVE HERE SINGAPORE
IF THEY DIED AT WHAT AGE AND WHAT YEAR
THAT IS WHEN WE GET GIRLS IN SCHOOL WE'LL GET AN IMPACT 15 TO 20 YEARS LATER WHICH IS A
WE HAVE TO HAVE A MODERN CONCEPT WHICH FITS TO THE DATA
THEY GET SAMSUNG HOW CAN THEY BE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY
NOW THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE THEORETICAL BUT IT'S NOT SO THEORETICAL
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE ENVIRONMENT AND AVOID THE TERRIBLE CLIMATE CRISIS IF WE DON'T STABILIZE THE WORLD
BUT THEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAYING THERE IS NO PROGRESS IN AFRICA
AND THEN THEY GOT THE ASWAN DAM
AND THERE WAS SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH ARE NOW BEING SOLVED AT A MUCH BETTER SCALE
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
AND LET NO IMMIGRANTS IN ANYMORE BUILD A WALL
SO AT THE TIME CHRIS AND I SAT DOWN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO REALLY TAKE THE TED BRAND AND OPEN SOURCE IT IN A
SO REALLY TEDX IS YOUR PROGRAM
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE WATCHING THE TALKS
AT THAT TIME IT WAS BEFORE THE PROLIFERATION OF VIDEO
SO OUT OF THAT THE TEDX PROGRAM WAS BORN
WE HAVE MORE BLACK AND BROWN MEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED
I AM THERESA HODGE
WELL I KNEW IT WASN'T MY NAME
IT'S A COMBINATION OF EVERYBODY WITH ONE EXCEPTION
MY MOTHER MY FOUR SISTERS AND MY DAUGHTER AND I
AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES
THINK OF THE NUMBER OF BLIND PEOPLE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING
YOU HEAR THE TRAFFIC
THEY OFTEN PREVENT YOU FROM LEARNING ABOUT AND RELATING TO ALL THE FASCINATING THINGS
WE DON'T CLIMB HIGHER
FIND YOUR OWN CONCRETE WAYS TO CARRY ACROSS OUR MANY CULTURES
SPOKEN LANGUAGES THOUGH CAN CREATE BARRIERS BETWEEN CULTURES
WE ARE ABLE TO DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT OUR CULTURAL BACKGROUND IS
WE DON'T FLY OR SWIM BETTER
IT'S A COMMON GROUND UPON WHICH WE CAN PLANT COMPLEX YET BALANCED CONVERSATIONS
WHY AREN'T THOSE MEN IN WITH THE OTHER MEN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT
AND WOODY'S UP ON DECK AND AT LEAST IF THEY ARE HIT HE PROBABLY HAS A CHANCE
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
THE CAPTAIN SAYS OH I CAN'T DO THAT
HARRIETT WOULD NOT MOVE
SHE WAS DRAGGED OFF THAT BUS SHE WAS SHOUTING THE WHOLE TIME
I WANT TO TELL ONE MORE STORY ABOUT WOODY GUTHRIE
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I WASN'T THINKING I'D BE LAUNCHING A PROJECT THAT WOULD TAKE AS OF NOW
SO IN ORDER TO PAINT THE PORTRAITS I HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME THAN PAINTING RESEARCHING READING
I HEAR VOICES WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE
THE LAW SAID THAT A WHITE PERSON COULDN'T EVEN SIT ACROSS THE AISLE FROM A BLACK PERSON BECAUSE OF THE
SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND LET THE BLACK SOLDIERS COME IN AND SING WITH THE WHITE SOLDIERS
THAT'S THE PART THE KIDS DON'T SING
HOW THEY GOT TO WHERE THEY ARE MAY BE IMPORTANT IN SHAPING THE INPUT INFORMATION BUT ONCE WE KNOW
AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY BALANCE THOSE TWO THINGS
HOW ABOUT 10 TIMES
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN CAME UP AGAINST MANY OBJECTIONS AND MANY OBSTACLES ALONG THE WAY
IF YOU HAVE REVISITED EVERY QUOTE
2 TO 1 JUST 10 YEARS AGO
IF YOU ARE PESSIMIST YOU MIGHT SAY
THE WORLDS MEDIA DESCENDED ON THIS TOWN
HERE IS MY VIEW
THAT'S 20 MILLION PEOPLE SPEAKING ABOUT AN EVENT BEFORE A SINGLE NEWS ORGANIZATION HAS PUBLISHED
SOMETIMES IT'S WHOLE STORIES THEMSELVES
THE TREMOR OCCURRED AT 9
IF YOU'VE CHECKED EVERY FACT
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY STRANGE ABOUT THIS STORY
IT SPENDS TIME WITH THE COMMUNITY GETS TO KNOW THEIR STORIES
THAT'S AN INCREASE FROM 3
SPEAKING TO SOME PEOPLE
GETTING SOME PROPER QUOTES
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SURVIVORS OF THE MV SEWOL IN KOREA
BUT OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT ALONE
10 OF TWEETS DURING THAT HOUR CONCERNED HER DEATH
I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE
THIS SORT OF THING IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE
PUSHED THE BUTTON AND THE STORY WENT UP ONLINE
IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MINERS OF SOMA
TAKING A BIT OF TIME
THERE WAS BLANKET COVERAGE
IN 2012 EL PA S SACKED ALMOST A 1 3 OF ITS EDITORIAL STAFF
IMPUNITY WAS BROKEN
AND OF COURSE MY FATHER WORKED HARD
IT'S NOT A SUITCASE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I HAD IN MY MIND
AND IT WORKS
AND IT ACCELERATES THE AMOUNT AND LEVEL OF THE STIMULATION
TO BE INTERESTED
THE NEXT ISSUE THAT RESOLVED WAS THAT IF 90 PERCENT OF HEAD AND NECK PAIN IS CAUSED BY
BUT THEY ASKED ONE QUESTION
AND HE WAS WALKING AROUND
THE AUDIENCE IS TOO SMALL
OVER THREE THESE DAYS
WE TAKE THE OLD INDEPENDENT STUDY CONCEPT
AND THE PROBLEM IS THE ADULTS
OUR STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO GO ON LEATHER COUCHES IN A ROOM THAT WE CLEANED OUT AND THEY COULD TAKE NAPS ON THEIR FREE TIME
IT NEEDS TO BE IMPORTANT TO US TO CREATE SCHOOLS THAT WORK BETTER FOR OUR KIDS IF WE
PEDAGOGY FIRST TECHNOLOGY SECOND IF APPROPRIATE
HE GOES TO PS3 IN STATEN ISLAND NEW YORK
HOW DO I KNOW THIS
IT IS RELEVANT MEANINGFUL AND ENGAGING
THIS WAS MY SCHOOL
MY SON NICOLAS IS 9
I SMILE WORK HARD WHY SHOULD MY CONSCIENCE TWITCH OR FLINCH
WE SEE THE SAME RESULT IN POLICE DATA
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WENT ON THE WALK THEY FELT A LOT BETTER IF THEY WERE IN NATURE COMPARED TO INDOORS
BUT IF WE COLLECTIVELY CATCH TOO MANY FISH THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SPAWN THERE'LL BE NO FISH AVAILABLE TO CATCH
ANOTHER WAY TO OUT THIS
GIVEN OUR DISCONNECTION FROM NATURE I THINK THAT THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE UNDERESTIMATING THAT COULD
NOW I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THIS STORY THE WAY I LEARNED ABOUT LOTS OF GOOD STORIES I KNOW FROM THE RADIO SHOW THIS AMERICAN
IT WAS ACTUALLY ASA CARTER WHO WROTE THOSE INFAMOUS WORDS THAT WALLACE SAID ON THE STEPS OF THE ALABAMA
WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT ON THE WAY INTO THE PARK PEOPLE STOP TO PICK UP THAT GLOVE ABOUT 62 PERCENT
FOR US TO TACKLE THESE PROBLEMS WE NEED BROAD BUY IN WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE NEED TO WORK COLLECTIVELY AND
SO WHAT ARE PHILOSOPHERS KNOWN FOR
WHEN I'VE GONE INTO CLASSES AND I'VE WORKED WITH THIRD GRADE UP THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE IN HIGH SCHOOL
WE NEED TO ENGAGE KIDS ON THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE
IMAGINE THAT YOU FIND A RING AND IF YOU TWIST THAT RING IT MAKES YOU INVISIBLE
BUT THEY DO MATTER
AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR US TO SAY THAT WE'RE FREE
WHAT REMAINS THE SAME THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF CHANGE OVER TIME
AND THE RESULT IS THAT KIDS THINK THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT DON'T MATTER
AND IT'S OUR JOB TO HELP GIVE THEM UPTAKE ON THOSE QUESTIONS
HOW DO WE MAKE MEANING IN OUR LIVES KNOWING THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE
COME UP WITH A COUNTEREXAMPLE
AND WHAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE THAT KIND OF CLAIM
WHAT STOPS YOU
BUT EVEN AT HOME I THINK OFTEN THEY DON'T GET UPTAKE
AND ONCE WE FIGURE OUT WHY THEY WOULD DO
SO WE DEVELOP THESE REALLY INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS OUT OF LITERATURE OUT OF PUZZLES OUT OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS AND WE HAVE
PHILOSOPHY IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE A DEEP ABSTRACT RIGOROUS DIFFICULT KIND OF DISCIPLINE
YOU CAN'T TEACH THAT FOR THE TEST VERY EASILY
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT EDUCATION IS ALL ABOUT
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT THING
AND MAKE MEANING IN IT
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DO PHILOSOPHY
BUT THEN WE CAN HELP THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSION TO COME TO SEE THAT WE PUNISH THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE
THEY'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD
WE'LL TALK ABOUT BRAVERY
WE'RE CREATURES WHO CHANGE OVER TIME
MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY INSANE IMPOSSIBLE
ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS IS YOU'LL GET BEST FRIENDS SAYING I NEVER REALIZED I COULD REALLY DISAGREE WITH HIM ABOUT SOMETHING
IF YOU THINK IT IS THE SAME BOAT WHY
FROG AND TOAD RUN AWAY FROM A LOT OF THINGS ALL THE TIME SAYING WE'RE VERY BRAVE
IF WE ARE BOTH DETERMINED AND FREE
SO WE HAVE AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION WITH THE KIDS
WHAT IS BRAVERY
SAY WHAT IT IS AND SHOW HOW IT MEETS THAT PERSON'S CLAIM
AND THEN STARTING WITH THE BOAT WE CAN TRANSLATE THAT INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT PERSONAL IDENTITY HUMAN IDENTITY
LOOK AT US RUN AWAY FROM THE SNAKE BUT WE'RE BEING VERY BRAVE
AT WHAT POINT IN THIS PROCESS OF CHANGE WOULD YOU HAVE SAID AH NO YOU HAVE A NEW BOAT
WE'RE INCREASINGLY GETTING FUNNELED IN THAT DIRECTION IN EDUCATION
AND IT'S AMAZING WHAT THEY COME UP WITH
WE HAVE TO GET THE ARROW GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE CAN BUILD THESE REALLY INTERESTING DEEP CONVERSATIONS WITH KIDS
THEY ASK THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS ON THEIR OWN
THE ANSWERS ARE AMBIGUOUS
PHILOSOPHERS WANT TO KNOW FOR INSTANCE IF WE ARE REALLY FREE
WE WANT TO ENHANCE THEIR COGNITIVE SKILLS
SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT PHILOSOPHERS ASK AND LIKE I SAID I THINK KIDS ASK THEM VERY NATURALLY
AND WHY DO WE START WARS
SO THEY DON'T REALLY GET UPTAKE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN PART BECAUSE TEACHERS AREN'T TRAINED TO DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF
CRITICAL THINKING RIGHT
OVER THE COURSE OF TIME MAYBE FIVE YEARS YOU ACTUALLY REPLACE EVERY SINGLE BOARD OR EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE BOAT
ADULTS HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME ASKING THEM
THEY ARE WONDERING ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND WHAT THEIR PLACE IS IN IT
AND INITIALLY SOME KIDS WILL THINK IT'S WRONG BECAUSE WE GET PUNISHED FOR IT
OR WE'LL ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF RIGHT AND WRONG
AND SO WE FUMBLE RIGHT AND MAYBE WE PUT IT OFF A LITTLE BIT AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS THEM
HOW WOULD WE KNOW IF IT DOES
KIDS ARE ACTUALLY VERY NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS
BUT A LOT OF PHILOSOPHERS BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE FREE
WHY DO YOU NOT DO THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE RING
YOUR FRIEND JUST MADE THIS CLAIM CAN YOU IMAGINE A COUNTEREXAMPLE OR A DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE
EVEN CAN YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT DREAMING
AND IF YOU THINK IT'S NOT THE SAME BOAT WELL NOW TELL ME WHEN DID IT NOT BECOME THE SAME BOAT
THOSE ARE GOOD SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO DO WELL FOR THEM IN OTHER KINDS OF ENDEAVORS AS WELL
AND WHAT WE'VE FOUND NOT ONLY IN OUR OWN WORK WHERE KIDS REALLY ENJOY IT AND LOVE IT BUT IN WORK DONE AROUND THE
EITHER REMAINS THE SAME OR HOW DO YOU RETAIN AN IDENTITY OVER ALL OF THIS CHANGE
THEY ARE NOT WRONG BECAUSE THEY ARE PUNISHED
AND THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THEM IS THEY DON'T TAKE ANY LAB SPACE
WE DON'T NEED BEAKERS OR CHEMICALS THERE'S NO SAFETY TRAINING
IS IT STANDING UP IN THE FACE OF YOUR OWN FEAR AND DOING SOMETHING
I THINK THIS IS REALLY EMPOWERING FOR THEM
ARE WE REALLY THE SAME AS OUR EARLIER SELVES
SO WE'LL USE EVEN SIMPLE THINGS LIKE ARNOLD LOBEL'S FROG AND TOAD ADVENTURES
IMAGINE YOU HAVE A BOAT
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA THE AVERAGE MARS MISSION TAKES HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS FOR YEARS TO
WHICH IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED OR QUALIFIED FOR
IN THIS CASE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
THAT'S 100 MILLION KILOS A DAY
STANDS FOR SOMETHING
I KNEW NOTHING
SOME EXPERT I WAS ON LEADERSHIP
A KID OF 5 OR 65 VOTED IN THE SAME WAY
I LIKE A LOT OF BLACK COLORS A LOT OF GRAYS AND STUFF LIKE THAT
THEY'RE PART OF THE SAME SOCIAL MECHANISM
NO WONDER NEWSPAPERS ARE DYING
BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION
THAT'S NOT MY JOB
WHO THEY WERE WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHERE THEY LIVED AND WHO THEY
THAT'S ONE OF THE ARCHAIC DUAL FORMS
IT IS AFTER ALL HARD TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING YOU CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS
I THOUGHT IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT GETTING DISTRACTED
WE LEARN HOW OUR BRAINS AND BODIES WORK BY WATCHING THOSE AROUND US
IF YOU DON'T ADHD YOURSELF CHANCES ARE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO DOES
I STARTED HAVING TROUBLE MAKING IT TO CLASS ON TIME
IT WASN'T UNTIL MIDDLE SCHOOL WHEN I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING MYSELF TO CLASSES ON TIME AND REMEMBERING TO BRING MY OWN
I'M HAPPIER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE
THEY'RE YOUR EMPLOYEE YOUR BOSS YOUR FRIEND THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM
SAME THING IN THE CLINIC WAITING ROOM
IT REQUIRES A NON CLINICAL ARMY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND CASE MANAGERS AND MANY
I JUST WANTED A BLESSING I DIDN'T WANT SOME KIND OF MANDATE
THESE THINGS ARE OURS
GEIGER I KNEW I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS HISTORY
SO WE THOUGHT IF WE CAN GET INDIVIDUAL DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE THESE BASIC RESOURCES FOR THEIR PATIENTS
SO I HAVE SPENT HOURS UPON HOURS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS WEIRD GROUNDHOG DAY
SO JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE AT CHILDREN'S NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
THIS ASPIRATION THAT OUR HEALTHCARE KEEP US HEALTHY IS AN ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL ONE
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I LEARNED AT HEALTH LEADS NOT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL
THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU GET A TASTE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALIZE YOUR ASPIRATION FOR HEALTHCARE YOU WANT
AND THEY LEAVE WITH THE CONVICTION THE ABILITY AND THE EFFICACY TO REALIZE OUR MOST BASIC
AND WE ALWAYS WON BECAUSE THE JUDGES WERE JUST SO GROSSED OUT
COLLEGE SPORTS TEAMS SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DOZENS OF HOURS AT SOME FIELD ACROSS CAMPUS AT SOME
THE DOCTORS IT SEEMED NEVER REALLY HAD ENOUGH TIME FOR ALL THE PATIENTS TRY AS THEY MIGHT
YOU NEED MORE
THE AVERAGE NCAA DIVISION I MEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYER DEDICATES 39 HOURS A WEEK TO
MY BELIEF IS THAT IT'S ALMOST TOO PAINFUL TO ARTICULATE OUR ASPIRATIONS FOR OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR
THEY WILL BE USED FOR OUR PURPOSES
WHICH WAS FUNDING GEIGER'S CLINIC FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS THEY WERE FURIOUS
SO THAT'S WHERE HEALTH LEADS BEGAN
IF WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM RATHER THAN A SICK CARE SYSTEM WHY DON'T WE
BUT HE HASN'T PAID HIS RENT OF COURSE BECAUSE HE'S PAYING FOR HIS HIV MEDICATION AND JUST CAN'T AFFORD BOTH
DO THEY HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO THE PHARMACY
SO IT'S A BRUTAL WINTER IN THE NORTHEAST YOUR KID HAS ASTHMA YOUR HEAT JUST GOT TURNED OFF AND OF COURSE YOU'RE IN THE WAITING ROOM OF THE
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE NEAREST FOOD PANTRY IS
AND OVER THE COURSE OF NINE MONTHS I HAD THE CHANCE TO HAVE DOZENS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH LOW INCOME
AND THIS ISN'T JUST A SORT OF SHORT TERM WORKFORCE TO CONNECT PATIENTS TO BASIC RESOURCES IT'S A NEXT
IT'S JUST A SET OF CHOICES THAT PEOPLE MAKE
SO ON THE ONE HAND THIS IS JUST A BASIC RECODING OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD
HEALTH JUST TAKES MORE TIME
SO OUR FEELING IS IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE RUGBY TEAM IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HEALTH AND POVERTY
AND WHEN THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN WASHINGTON D
AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD FROM A
BUT IN MY WORLD IT'S CALLED REDUCED OBESITY AND DIABETES
BARRY ZUCKERMAN WAS DOING AS CHAIR OF PEDIATRICS AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER
AND ONE OF OUR LITIGATION STRATEGIES WAS ACTUALLY TO SEND ME INTO THE HOME OF THESE CLIENTS WITH THESE LARGE GLASS
YOU MUST PURSUE THAT VISION
AND WE CHOSE TO USE THE PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT PURPOSE
BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THESE NINE MONTHS I GREW FRUSTRATED WITH FEELING LIKE WE WERE INTERVENING TOO FAR
THEY WILL BE USED TO REALIZE OUR ASPIRATION
WE'VE CREATED A PRESUMPTION THAT IF YOU'RE A PATIENT AT THAT HOSPITAL WITH AN ELEVATED BMI THE FOUR WALLS OF THE
HERE WE ARE 45 YEARS AFTER GEIGER HAS PRESCRIBED FOOD FOR HIS PATIENTS AND I HAVE
WE HAD MOMS WHO WOULD COME IN DAUGHTER HAS ASTHMA WAKES UP COVERED IN COCKROACHES EVERY MORNING
THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT CHILD IS LIVING WITH 12 OTHER PEOPLE IN A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE MEASURE HEALTHCARE IT WILL BE NOT BY WHAT THE SYSTEM WAS BUT
THAT IF WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND LISTEN QUIETLY THAT WE ALL
SO HEALTH LEADS WAS BORN OF THESE CONVERSATIONS A SIMPLE MODEL WHERE DOCTORS AND NURSES CAN
SO THE PROBE WILL BIND SPECIFICALLY
SO INSTEAD OF EXCLUSIVELY SYNTHESIZING PROTEINS IN THE CELL BODY WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS TO
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH PROTEIN IS IN A SINGLE CELL
WE'LL SEE THE SAME THING IN THE ECONOMIC RECESSION WE'RE HAVING NOW
WHAT NOW FITS IN OUR POCKETS WOULD FIT IN A BLOOD CELL IN 25 YEARS
AND I WAS ASKED WELL AREN'T YOU NERVOUS
IT'S HARDWIRED IN OUR BRAINS
IT'S ALREADY VERY CLOSE TO US
WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT MIT WE ALL SHARED ONE COMPUTER THAT TOOK UP A WHOLE BUILDING
AND THAT REALLY DESCRIBES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
WHEN WE WALKED THROUGH THE SAVANNA A THOUSAND YEARS AGO WE MADE LINEAR PREDICTIONS WHERE THAT ANIMAL WOULD BE AND THAT WORKED FINE
AND THE PROJECT WAS FINISHED ON TIME
IMAGINE AN INTERNET WITHOUT ADS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF PAYING WITH OUR ATTENTION WHEN WE VIEW
AND BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED THAT THEY DO
AND THEY CAN PAY ME FOR WHAT THEY FIND OUT
BUT IT ALSO GREATLY INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY
AND WHEN IT DOESN'T IT'S OFTEN THE FAULT OF THOSE LARGE INSTITUTIONS
OR AT LEAST IT'S UP TO THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM
NOW THE YAP DON'T ACTUALLY MOVE THESE RAI STONES AROUND OR EXCHANGE THEM THE WAY WE DO WITH
BUT THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS WELL AND THE YAP ACTUALLY STILL USE A FORM OF THESE
IT STILL COUNTED
WILL WE ALL BECOME SLAVES TO ALGORITHMS AND UTILITY FUNCTIONS
AND EVERY MONTH A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IS DEDUCTED FROM MY PAYCHECK AND INVESTED IN MUTUAL FUNDS IN MY
OUR ACCESS TO DIGITAL MONEY AND OUR ABILITY TO FREELY TRANSACT IS BEING HELD
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DROP ME
I RECOGNIZED THEM
WE PROVIDED EDUCATION
EVERYWHERE ASPIRATIONS ARE GOING UP
AND WE ARGUED WITH THE WORLD BANK
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T I'M EXTREMELY WORRIED
WE WILL EVEN PROVIDE FINANCING
IT'S A PREFERENTIAL OPTION FOR THE POOR
YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT
JEFF SKOLL IS HERE
7 CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR
IT CAN'T BE DONE
THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK CITY IN THE 1950S
WE GREW UP IN IOWA
AND I SAID OK THAT'S IT RIGHT
WE WILL HELP YOU DO THAT
LOWEST BID 25 CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR FOR ZAMBIA
IT DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE IDEAS
ARE THERE NEW WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN RISE TO MEET THESE ASPIRATIONS
I'M PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT PULL UP THE LADDER BEHIND ME
AND SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT MEETING THESE ASPIRATIONS
THAT'S A NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE BOND
WE WILL MAKE THE INTRODUCTIONS
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID
AND THEN A CRAZY THING HAPPENED
THEIR ASPIRATIONS WENT UP
AND THEY SAID WELL THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT BUT IT'S JUST NOT COST EFFECTIVE
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO COLLEGE
THAT IS AS MANY AS THE NUMBER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE HAVE
CHINA AND JAPAN HAVE AN EVEN LONGER HISTORY OF RIVALRY AND HAVE BEEN DEPLOYING THEIR AIR FORCES AND NAVIES TO SHOW THEIR
NOW LET'S STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE
IT TELLS US THAT LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES ARE CONDEMNED TO BE POOR THAT SMALL COUNTRIES CANNOT ESCAPE
WE HAVE TAKEN ON SUCH ENORMOUS DEBTS SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS BUT HAVE WE INVESTED THEM
TO BE THERE AS TOUR GUIDE WITH MY GROUP WATCHING HIM HIS HEAD TILTED OVER HIS ROBE THEN GOES OUT AND HE LOSES
YOU NEED TO GO THERE AND MEET THESE PEOPLE
MY FRIENDS IN EUROPE ALWAYS REMIND ME
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S HELPED ME TO BECOME A BETTER CITIZEN OF THIS PLANET
AND I WHIRL AND I WHIRL AND I LOSE MYSELF IN THAT TRANSE THINKING OF THE TEACHINGS OF MEVLANA
WHY DO AMERICANS HAVE SUCH SOFT BREAD
YOU ALREADY HAVE
I THOUGHT WELL HAVE I EVER SAID DAMN SOMETHING
IT DOESN'T DIMINISH OURS BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER IN OUR TRAVELS THAT THERE ARE OTHER HEROES
I JUST LOVE TURKEY AND AS A TOUR GUIDE I HAD THE CHANCE TO TAKE A GROUP TO GET TO KNOW A WHIRLING DERVISH
WELL IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE THEY ARRESTED A POT SMOKER IN THE NETHERLANDS AND WHAT THEY FOUND AFTER 25 YEARS IS
I KNEW THIS DERVISH AND I ASKED HIM
AND FOR 30 YEARS I'VE HAD THE POOR REACHING IN MY WINDOW
IRAN HAS GOT BAGGAGE AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM SMARTLY
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU GO TO SCANDINAVIA HOW MANY DRUNK TEENAGERS YOU FIND ON DECORATED TRUCKS
WHEN I AM TRAVELING I FIND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SLICES OF CULTURE THAT I NEVER REALIZED PEOPLE COULD BE
I SAID YEAH
A SOCIETY HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE TOLERATE ALTERNATIVE LIFE STYLES OR BUILD MORE PRISONS
WELL IN THE ADULTHOOD YOU REALIZE
A PRESENT DAY NATHAN HALE
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE JUST A FEW MINUTES TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY
I WAS HEADING FOR MAZATL N AND I WAS JUST NEEDY FOR A NICE STRETCH OF PRISTINE BEACH SWEPT FREE OF
CUT GLASS PEAKS AGAINST THAT BLUE SKY
BULGARIANS HAVE THE BULGARIAN DREAM
AND I'LL TELL YOU
A GREAT SORT OF LEARNING AREA WADING POOL FOR WORLD EXPLORATION TO ME IS EUROPE
SMELL THIS CHEESE
IT SMELLS LIKE THE FEET OF ANGELS
I'VE GOT A GOOD FRIEND IN SWITZERLAND WHO'S A SCHOOL TEACHER IN A LITTLE TRADITIONAL VILLAGE WHERE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME LAST
AN EASY ONE IS
SHE DID ONE OF THOSE LITTLE POINT ON MY CHEST THINGS SHE SAID
IN EUROPE THEY'VE GOT THE SAME VICTIMLESS CRIME ISSUES AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THEM
JUST SAY NO
THAT'S THE MARK OF A GOOD TRIP
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MAKES THEM TICK
WELL YOU KNOW THEY GREW UP WITH THE SHAH ON THE THRONE
AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT CAUSE I WANT TO EMPATHIZE WITH THAT CAUSE
I'M A DERVISH THAT'S LIKE A MONK THAT FOLLOWS MEVLANA THAT'S SORT OF A TEACHER IN ISLAM
YOU'RE IN IRAN ANYTIME SOMETHING'S FRUSTRATING TO US AND OUT OF OUR CONTROL WE SAY DEATH TO THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS DUE FOR A VACATION
IT'S A THRIVING COUNTRY OF 70 MILLION PEOPLE
NORWEGIANS HAVE THE NORWEGIAN DREAM
ONE GREAT WAY TO MAKE YOUR TRAVELS MORE MEANINGFUL IS TO RELATE TO TO EMBRACE A
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO IRAN
NOW APPRECIATING THE VALUE OF TRAVEL IS NOTHING NEW
1400 YEARS AGO MOHAMMED SAID
AND AHEAD OF ME I HEAR THE LONG LEGATO TONES OF AN ALPHORN ANNOUNCING THAT THE HELICOPTER STOCKED MOUNTAIN HUT IS OPEN
AND IF I AM MAKING A TOUR OR A GUIDEBOOK OR A TV SHOW AND I AM NOT CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH PEOPLE I AM KIND OF NERVOUS BECAUSE
SO WHEN THE AUDIO HOME RECORDING ACT OF 1992 WAS PASSED THE MEDIA BUSINESSES GAVE UP
AND THE MAIN REASON IT HASN'T WORKED IS THE INTERNET HAS TURNED OUT TO BE FAR MORE POPULAR AND FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN
WE ARE IN A WORLD WHERE MOST AMERICAN CITIZENS OVER THE AGE OF 12
AND THIS FREAKED THE MEDIA BUSINESSES OUT IT FREAKED THEM OUT EVERY TIME
IT'S FROM THE SENATE
SO THEY WENT FOR PLAN B
SOME OF THE STUFF WE SHARE IS STUFF WE'VE FOUND
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR
WHAT MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ABECEDARIAN CHILDREN
VIOLENCE IS EVERYWHERE
I REMEMBER ONE YOUNG MAN
AND HE WAS ANGRY
AH THERE WE GO
GOOD MORNING EVERYONE
AND IT'S OK AND WHEN I FEEL LIKE RUBBISH I'M REALLY GOING TO EMBRACE THAT RUBBISH FEELING I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GET INTO BED I'M GOING TO WATCH
AND SO THE SENATE WON IN THE END
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
AND DURING THAT TIME THE RECESSION KICKED IN AND I LOST MY JOB
AND THEN LATER ON THAT DAY MY MOTHER GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FAMILY FRIEND IN NIGERIA AND THE
AND THEN NO TELEVISION EXPANDED INTO NO PHONES NO CABLE NO MUSIC
AND SO THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM BEING A SPORTS REPORTER TO BEING A POLITICAL REPORTER OR A BUSINESS REPORTER
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
SO AFTER DOING THAT FOR A FEW YEARS EVENTUALLY BY PURE CHANCE I HAPPENED TO MEET AN EXECUTIVE AT
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT IN THEIR CHOSEN CAREERS
SO THIS IS A LESSON AS WELL THAT I HAD LEARNED FROM MY OLDER BROTHER
I WAS RAISED IN A SINGLE PARENT FAMILY WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AND THEREFORE I FOUND IT
SO EVENTUALLY AFTER EMAILING AND PESTERING CONSTANTLY THEY EVENTUALLY GOT BACK TO ME
AND WE WERE WAITING AND WAITING
I BELIEVE IN CREATING WHAT I WANT
I WORKED VERY HARD I GOT STRAIGHT A'S AND I WENT TO OXFORD
MY MOTHER WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME
I WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD
AND MY MOTHER AND I WERE IN THE KITCHEN IN OUR HOUSE IN LONDON
SO IT TOOK THEM SEVERAL MONTHS TO GET BACK TO ME
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE READY
AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME HOME ON SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988
BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THE STORY
USUALLY WHAT THEY SAY IS IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED TO NETWORK HAVE A BRAND STUDY YOUR COMPETITION
AND SHE HAD SOME PRACTICAL ADVICE AS WELL BUT SUDDENLY THE MORAL OF HER STORY WAS THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE
I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT
SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMPETITION
SO WHEN I MET HIM HE GAVE ME ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO COME IN FOR A SCREEN TEST AND
EVERYONE IN THE CAR DIED INSTANTLY APART FROM ONE PERSON IN THE BACK SEAT WHERE MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER WERE SITTING
THAT'S ALL I REALLY KNEW HOW TO DO
THE WORST AND PROBABLY MOST DIFFICULT DAY IN MY LIFE WAS SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988
AND THE REASON WHY I SHARE THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT SUCCESS IS NEVER REALLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
WE'D JUST GOTTEN BACK FROM A WEDDING IN NIGERIA
WE TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN BUT OF COURSE EVERY BRAIN IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS OR SOME
I PUT MY OWN MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS AND I'VE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN FARMLAND LP AS I MENTIONED WHICH IS CONVERTING
FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT THE TOPSOIL
WE'RE NOT EVEN AVERAGE
FOR ONE THING CHIPOTLE WHICH IS THE CLOSEST WE HAVE TO A FAST FOOD ORGANIC COMPANY IS THE SINGLE FASTEST
ABOUT 20 PEOPLE OF COLOR 15 HISPANIC AND ABOUT SIX OUT OF TEN SHOP AT WALMART
THIS IS AN APPROXIMATION THIS IS NOT VERY EXACT MATH
WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE FOOD IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EAT MORE MEAT
WELL GREAT BUT INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE FOR ALL OF ITS ILLS SURELY AT LEAST THE ONE THING IT HAS IS THAT IT'S MORE EFFICIENT
THE LEADING EXPORTER OF PORK IN THE WORLD TODAY IS DENMARK
THAT'S NOT EFFICIENT IT'S INCREDIBLY WASTEFUL
IT MUST BE BECAUSE ORGANIC FARMING IS MORE EXPENSIVE RIGHT
WELL SO MAYBE ORGANIC FARMING SAVES MONEY BUT PERHAPS IT PRODUCES LESS FOOD
IT'S BEING IMPORTED
YOU MUST BE THINKING
THE GENERAL U
WHO IN AMERICA IS BUYING IT
INSTEAD WE'RE MINING MINERALS IN MORROCO SHIPPING THEM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SPRAYING THEM ON THE FIELDS ONLY TO
THAT'S HOW MUCH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CONSUMED
FEED THE WORLD
DENMARK IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS FOR MANY YEARS BANNED THE USE OF SUB THERAPEUTIC ANTIBIOTICS IN LIVESTOCK
THIS IS NOT A BLANKET STATEMENT IT VARIES BY CROP AND REGION BUT THERE ARE LOT OF WAYS IN WHICH WHEN DONE RIGHT
A LOT OF WEDDINGS AT THAT HOTEL
NOBODY WILL EVER DO THIS
THE GREAT THING ABOUT MELATONIN IS IT HAS GREAT ANTIOXIDANT QUALITIES THAT RID OUR BRAIN
BECAUSE THE WELFARE STATE AND THE UNIONS WORK IN TANDEM WITH CAPITALIST DYNAMICS
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE WORKING THERE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
WE ALSO NEED TO BE FOR SOMETHING
HERE WE ARE
NOW MORE THAN 500 YEARS AFTER THOMAS MORE FIRST WROTE ABOUT A BASIC INCOME AND 100 YEARS AFTER GEORGE ORWELL
IT GETS SLOWER AND SLOWER MAKING ERRORS
WHAT THEY SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED COMPLETELY BLEW MY MIND
EVELYN FORGET DISCOVERED THAT THE PEOPLE IN DAUPHIN HAD NOT ONLY BECOME RICHER BUT ALSO SMARTER AND HEALTHIER
WE'VE GOT THE RESEARCH WE'VE GOT THE EVIDENCE AND WE'VE GOT THE MEANS
I BEGAN GETTING USED TO WORKING ALONE
AFTER PAYING THEM MY PARENTS NEVER FELT THE SAME ABOUT LIVING IN IRAQ
I REMEMBER PLAYING KICKBALL FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES
THEY FORGOT THAT THE ROOTS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION WAS IN MESOPOTAMIA
I WONDER WHERE TAKING RISKS WILL TAKE YOU ALL
HOW DO SHARING AND TRANSACTIONS GO TOGETHER
I'VE GOT A 30 SECOND EXPERIMENT THAT WILL PUSH YOU PAST YOUR COMFORT ZONE
THERE'S A COMPLETE STRANGER SLEEPING IN MY LIVING ROOM
THINGS LIKE WHAT
PEOPLE LIKE YOU
10 OF EVERYTHING IS 1
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT DRIVERLESS CARS
EVERY TIME WE ENGAGE WITH A NEW CLIENT THE STEPS MULTIPLY AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS ON STEPS IN THIS VALUE CHAIN
IT'S THE PLANE CRASH IN NIGERIA WHEN I LIVED THERE IN 2012
SO JOIN ME ON THIS JOURNEY BRIEFLY AS AN INSPIRATION FOR HOW YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ENGAGE
YOU HAVE TO PUT THESE THREE ELEMENTS TOGETHER
THIS IS A FUEL INJECTION NOZZLE FOR THE NEW GENERATION OF GE JET ENGINES
AND THAT IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
300000 PHONE LINES FOR THEN ABOUT 155 MILLION PEOPLE
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN USED AS A PROTOTYPING TOOL BUT IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THAT
THEY'RE ALL 3D PRINTED NOW
IF WE'RE SENDING A DIGITAL DESIGN ACROSS BORDERS WILL TAX IT THE SAME WAY
SO WE'VE MOVED FROM A PROTOTYPING TOOL TO A CUSTOMIZATION TOOL AND NOW WE'RE MOVING TO A MANUFACTURING TOOL
THEY HAD TO TAKE THE PART BACK TO AMERICA THEY HAD TO REVERSE ENGINEER IT AND THEN INSTALL IT
YOU HAVE THAT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE
SO I'M JUST GIVING YOU A 30000 FEET VIEW
3D PRINTERS YOU CAN BUY FOR 200 OR 300 DOLLARS NOW TO MAKE PROTOTYPES
THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF MORE
BUT MORE THAN THAT EVEN
WE HAVE A BIG GAP IN THAT MONEY
IT DOESN'T SURVIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT HARDLY AT ALL
THEY HAD COME FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
WE'RE CUTTING CORNERS AND EVERY TIME WE CUT CORNERS MORE PLACES GET INFECTED THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE AND IT JUST SLOWS US
SHE FIXED THE DOORKNOB AND THEN OFFERED TO TAKE THE TOOLS BACK DOWNSTAIRS
BUT OF COURSE MY LAZY PERFECTIONIST SELF DOES NOT LIKE BEING REMINDED WHEN I DO THINGS
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
ALL THEY REALLY DO IS GUIDE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE IN CONFLICT SO THEY CAN COME TO THEIR OWN
I WISH I KNEW HOW TO LET GO SOMETIMES AND REMOVE MYSELF FROM THE MORE AGGRESSIVE PARTS OF
WE DIDN'T SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BAD IN THE PAST IT'S ALWAYS BEEN POSSIBLE TO EXPAND A RESERVOIR
AND IN THE PROCESS OF PASSING THROUGH THE WETLAND AND PERCOLATING THROUGH THE GROUND THE WATER ENCOUNTERS
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES NOW
WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN SEAWATER DESALINATION IN THE PAST TWO DECADES
FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO LIVE IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CITIES WE'VE NEVER TRULY
OUR GRANDPARENTS' GENERATION CREATED AN AMAZING SYSTEM OF CANALS AND RESERVOIRS THAT MADE IT
BUT MY OWN EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST WATER STARVED CITIES IN THE LAST DECADES
AND THE PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WATER CONSERVATION IS OUTDOORS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER
SO WE HAD TO USE SPECIAL PROTOCOLS TO NOT CONTAMINATE THE ENVIRONMENT WITH OUR PRESENCE AND WE TRIED ALSO TO SHARE
THEY HAVE TO DO SCIENCE
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE
SO HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE
BUT SOON THE QUEST FOR EXPLORATION BROUGHT ME TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE PLANET SEARCHING FOR NEW POTENTIAL
AND IN FACT WE DISCOVERED IN THE CAVE A NEW MINERAL STRUCTURE FOR SCIENCE WHICH IS ROSSIANTONITE A PHOSPHATE
THEY HAVE A LOT OF TASKS
THEY ARE ALL ABOUT PROVIDING BASIC INFORMATION WEATHER FORECASTS LEGAL INFORMATION GUIDANCE
THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO OVERCOME OUR SPEECHLESSNESS AND THE SEPARATION PROVOKED BY RIVAL POLITICAL FORCES
OVER 15000 MESSAGES WERE SENT
THE SITUATION FOR THE ASYLUM SEEKERS IS MADE WORSE BY CONTRADICTORY POLICIES AND THE TEMPTATION OF
IT IS ONLY IN TRULY EXPOSING OURSELVES TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF THIS EXPERIENCE
WE HAVE EUROPEAN PASSPORTS VISAS AND AIR TICKETS
WHAT IS NEW IS HOW THESE REALITIES ARE HIDDEN AND HOW PEOPLE ARE MADE INVISIBLE IN AN AGE
SUCH MAKESHIFT SETTLEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED ILLEGAL AND THEREFORE THOSE LIVING IN THEM DON'T HAVE A
THE RIGHT OF ASSEMBLY AND THE RIGHT TO DEMONSTRATE ARE RESTRICTED THERE
AND PEOPLE DID COMMUNICATE
WE ARE USED TO INVITATIONS BUT THIS INVITATION REALLY THRILLED US
INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET THAT COULD ENSURE SURVIVAL ALONG DANGEROUS ROUTES IS BEING CENSORED AND THE
FILES APPEARED ON THE NETWORK INCLUDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS LEAKED FROM THE PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATION COMMISSION WHICH
BUT THEY AREN'T A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
SO HOW WE FEEL WE APPEAR TO OTHERS IS ENOURMOUSLY IMPORTANT TO OUR LIVES
MORE THAN A TOMBOY I WAS A TROUBLE MAKER
QUITE TO THE CONTRARY I WAS A TOMBOY
AND IT'S ALL AROUND
I THINK IT'S A LOUSY TRICK BECAUSE AT ITS CORE IT'S JUST A PUZZLE
I WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I THINK THIS IS A LOUSY TRICK
THE STRING HAS BEEN LACERATED
I WILL START WITH A CHEAP VISUAL STUNT TO GRAB YOUR ATTENTION AND COVER THE FACT THAT MY ACT IS
WHY DO WE DO IT THIS WAY
AND THIS TIME I DON'T LIKE IT I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE INTO IT BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NON STOP
AND I WANT TO LIVE EVERY DAY OF THE REST OF MY LIFE THAT WAY SWIM OR NO SWIM
WHO CARES THE LAST TWO MINUTES
SO I SWAM THROUGH THE NIGHT AND AT DAWN THEY GOT THERE AND THEY STARTED WITH PREDNISONE SHOTS
I CAN FEEL PROUD
THEY WERE PREPARED
AND BY THE WAY A REPORTER CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY AND HE SAID HE LOOKED ON WIKIPEDIA AND HE SAID HE SAW MY BIRTHDAY WAS AUGUST 22ND
SO THAT WAS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
IT'S 14 HOURS 58 MINUTES
AND WHEN I STARTED IN WITH THE EIGHT HOURS AND THE 10 HOURS AND THE 12 HOURS AND THE 14 HOURS AND THE 15
IF I GET STUNG I'LL JUST GRIN AND BEAR IT
AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS
AND HE IS DOWN
AND SHE REPLIED WELL I HAVE NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO ASK FOR CONSENT
HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE SOCIALIZATION OF BOYS AND THE DEFINITIONS OF MANHOOD THAT LEAD TO THESE CURRENT OUTCOMES
I KNOW THERE'S MORE THAN MEN AND WOMEN THERE'S MORE THAN MALE AND FEMALE
WHAT DO WE DO
WE KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE CAN EASILY DO THAT
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING A STAND ON THESE ISSUES SHOULD NOT FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF LITTLE BOYS OR
WE HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
WE'RE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT JOHN IT'S TOTALLY FOCUSED ON MARY
THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE
WHY WAS SHE DRINKING WITH THOSE GUYS IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY ADULT MEN'S VIOLENCE
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT MARY IS NOT GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE IN TERMS OF PREVENTING VIOLENCE
BY THE WAY WE OWE IT TO WOMEN
WE'LL SEE A RADICAL DIMINUTION OF THE ABUSE
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE REALLY
WE ALSO OWE IT TO YOUNG MEN WHO ARE GROWING UP ALL OVER THE WORLD IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE TO BE A
BECAUSE THE TYPICAL PERPETRATOR IS NOT SICK AND TWISTED
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND MALE CULTURE THE GOAL IS TO GET MEN WHO ARE NOT ABUSIVE TO CHALLENGE MEN WHO ARE
YOU KNOW WHAT
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT
HOW DO WE CHALLENGE OUR FRIENDS
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A CHIP IN OUR BRAIN IS ACTIVATED AND THE NEURAL PATHWAYS TAKE OUR ATTENTION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WHEN WE HEAR THE
MOST MALE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE VICTIMS OF OTHER MEN'S VIOLENCE
HOW DO WE SPEAK UP
THIS IS ALL UNCONSCIOUS
THAT'S A VERY NAIVE NOTION RIGHT
WE'VE GONE FROM JOHN BEAT MARY TO MARY WAS BEATEN BY JOHN
WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE CHALLENGE OUR POWER
OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL GET OFF IT
SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN USE THE SPOTLIGHT IS TO THANK WOMEN AND HONOR WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP GOING FORWARD
WHY DO THEY KEEP GOING BACK
THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE CHOICE
JUST LIKE WITH HETEROSEXISM IF YOU'RE A HETEROSEXUAL PERSON AND YOU YOURSELF DON'T ENACT HARASSING OR ABUSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS
HOW DOES ALL THIS WORK
AND LET ME ILLUSTRATE THAT CONFUSION BY WAY OF ANALOGY
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD GENDER THINK IT MEANS WOMEN
BUT HOW DO WE NOT REMAIN SILENT IN THE FACE OF ABUSE
WHY IS THAT A COMMON PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD TODAY
I KNOW WE CAN DO IT WE CAN DO BETTER
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT BOTH WOMEN AND MEN HAVE IN COMMON
THERE'S A WHOLE SPECTRUM
HOW DO WE SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS
MY ARGUMENT IS HE DOESN'T NEED SENSITIVITY TRAINING
NOT JUST WOMEN AND GIRLS BUT ALSO MEN AND BOYS
WE ARE BOTH VICTIMS OF MEN'S VIOLENCE
I'M USING THE GENDER BINARY
IN FACT I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT THESE ARE MEN'S ISSUES FIRST AND FOREMOST
WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN HELPING TO PRODUCE ABUSIVE MEN
THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF SILENCE IN MALE CULTURE ABOUT THIS ONGOING TRAGEDY OF MEN'S VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN
WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE BOYS
I DON'T SEE THESE AS WOMEN'S ISSUES THAT SOME GOOD MEN HELP OUT WITH
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN THE WORLD
BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO IT YOU REALIZE THERE ARE PRESSURES ON MEN
AND IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS LET'S TALK ABOUT MALE VICTIMS
AND OFTEN TIMES MEN LIKE MYSELF GET A LOT OF CREDIT AND PUBLIC ACCLAIM FOR DOING THE WORK THAT WOMEN
HE NEEDS LEADERSHIP TRAINING BECAUSE HE'S BEING A BAD LEADER BECAUSE IN A SOCIETY WITH GENDER DIVERSITY AND
THE QUESTIONS ARE NOT ABOUT MARY THEY'RE ABOUT JOHN
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE TERM GENDER
ADULT MEN WITH POWER ARE THE ONES WE NEED TO BE HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE FOR BEING LEADERS ON THESE ISSUES BECAUSE WHEN SOMEBODY SPEAKS UP IN A
BUT ON A BIG SCALE WE NEED MORE ADULT MEN WITH POWER TO START PRIORITIZING THESE ISSUES
BUT WE ALSO OWE IT TO OUR SONS
IT'S A LEGITIMATE THING TO ASK
THAT'S A GOOD ENGLISH SENTENCE
WE CAN DO SO THANKS TO THE HELP OF A MACHINE CALLED THE ANTIPROTON DECELERATOR
SO CHARGE PARITY TRANSFORMS A MATTER WORLD INTO AN ANTIMATTER
FOR THIS YOU NEED TO RECALL THAT WHENEVER MATTER ANTIMATTER MEET THEY GET TURNED INTO PURE LIGHT
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN THIRTIES A WHOLE NEW COMPONENT OF MATTER WAS FOUND WHICH IN SOME CELLS BEHAVE
BUT IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF NATURE HAVE NO SIZE AT
SO LET US ENTERTAIN THE IDEA FOR A WHILE THAT ANTIMATTER BEHAVE SO UNEXPECTEDLY AS TO FALL
MOST LIKELY WE WILL FIND THAT MATTER AND ANTIMATTER FALL IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IN
WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO GAIN BY SHARING THIS INFORMATION
EVERYONE PRESUMED THEY WERE DEAD
AND SHE'S AMAZING
AND THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY HERE THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS CAUSE
AND HELP IN THIS CASE DIDN'T COME FROM THE OUTSIDE IT ACTUALLY CAME FROM WITHIN
MY MOM CAME KNOCKING ONE MORNING AND SAID RAJ PACK YOUR THINGS WE HAVE TO GO
AND THIS DISEASE WOULD SPREAD FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER
WHEN WE OPEN UP TO THINK WITH LOVE AND WE ALLOW THE VOICE OF OUR INNER GUIDANCE SYSTEM TO COME FORWARD WE
AND I WENT TO MARIANE AND SAID HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST I CARRY THIS MESSAGE TO MY GENERATION
THAT MOMENT WHEN ALL OF THAT ANGER AND THAT PAST RESENTMENT JUST DISAPPEARS IT GOES AWAY IT NO LONGER
WHEN WE HAVE FULL FAITH THAT WE CAN SHOW UP WITHOUT AN OUTLINE OR WE CAN HAVE FULL FAITH THAT WE
EGO WORKS IN SO MANY VICIOUS WAYS
IF WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THAT FAITH THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING
I LIVE MY TRUTH I WALK MY TRUTH I BREATHE MY TRUTH
IT'S AN UNLEARNING OF THE NEGATIVITY OF THE LACK OF THE COMPARING OF THE SEPARATION
BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE ON THE STAGE I SAID SOME PRAYERS WITH SOME OF MY SISTERS AND WE WERE IN THE BACK AND I SAID MAY ALL THE GODDESSES OF THE
I AM HERE TO BE A STUDENT AND A TEACHER OF A COURSE IN MIRACLES
THE SECOND STEP IS A FOREGONE SURRENDER
EACH OF US AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND IN SOME WAY WE HAVE CHOSEN THAT TINY MAD IDEA AND AS THE COURSE SAYS
THE HOLY INSTANT IS WHEN AN ANCIENT HATRED BECOMES A HOLY LOVE
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE I HAD A TERRIBLE CASE OF THE WHEN I HAVES
WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW CLIENT I'LL BE HAPPY
THEN WE HAVE MORE HEALTH THEN WE HAVE MORE DIRECTION
WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW RELATIONSHIP I'LL BE HAPPY
SO I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 3 AM
LET GO OF YOUR PLANS
LET GO OF YOUR TIME CLOCK
ALL WE HAVE IS 18 MINUTES TO SPEAK TO YOU
EACH WOMAN ON THE STAGE TODAY HAD WILLINGNESS IN SOME FORM TO MAKE A CHANGE AND THAT'S WHY SHE IS WHO SHE IS TODAY
ONE MOMENT AT A TIME WE EXPERIENCE WHAT THE COURSE REFERS TO AS THE HOLY INSTANT THE MOMENT THAT WE
THEN WE HAVE MORE VITALITY
OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY MOMENTS WHEN I AM DISCONNECTED FROM MY TRUTH BUT I KNOW WHERE TO GO I SIT DOWN ON THAT MEDITATION
THE EGO WANTS US TO SEE EVERYONE AS SEPARATE
WHEN I HAVE THAT NEW PAIR OF SHOES I'LL BE HAPPY
THE WHOLE THING I JUST THOUGHT IN MY HALLUCINATORY MOMENT THAT I HEARD THE WORD TRACHEOTOMY
IT'LL ALWAYS BE PART OF US
IT SAYS YOU GO AHEAD
THERE WAS ACTION BEHIND THESE WORDS
WHEN BONNIE THOUGHT THE BACK OF MY THROAT WAS SWELLING UP SHE BROUGHT THE MEDICAL TEAM OVER TO OUR
I DIDN'T GIVE UP
AND WE'LL NEVER FORGET IT
ALL OF THAT'S GREAT AND I DON'T DENIGRATE IT
AND THE HYPOTHERMIA SETS IN
ON THE BEACH
BUT IT WAS DEEPER
THAT'S ALWAYS THERE AND IT'S UNDENIABLE
I DIDN'T DO IT
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BLACK THIS BLACK
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT I AM AT THE PRIME OF MY LIFE TODAY
I JUST WENT INTO THINKING ABOUT THIS DREAM AND WHY AND HOW
THE CRY OF RAW DATA NOW
IT'S BECAUSE THAT TRAVEL PATTERNS ARE MUCH LESS STABLE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK
NO ONE IS IN CHARGE
AND WHY IS THAT
YOU REALLY REDUCE CONGESTION QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
BUT WELL AS I SAID I MEAN CAR DRIVERS ADAPT RIGHT
SO WHY CAN THAT BE
SOMEONE MUST CONTROL ALL OF THIS
I MEAN IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM
EACH DAY PEOPLE MAKE NEW DECISIONS AND PEOPLE CHANGE AND THE WORLD CHANGES AROUND THEM AND EACH DAY ALL OF
I MEAN THINK ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT CITIES ARE ACTUALLY
AND THEY ARE SO COOL THAT THEY HAVE EVEN DEVELOPED A HAND SIGN
ECONOMISTS SAY THAT BY THE YEAR 2050 MEAT WILL BECOME A LUXURY PRODUCT
I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER FOOD SOURCE THAT COULD HAVE THIS KIND OF IMPACT ON BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
TO HELP FOSTER THAT CULTURAL CHANGE I'M STARTING WITH THE CRICKET
BY THE YEAR 2050 THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL 2 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET AND ECONOMISTS SAY THAT WE
IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE BEFORE I STARTED BITTY FOODS I WAS A TREND FORECASTER AND CONSUMER
IN THEIR DIREST ESTIMATES BEEF WILL BE PRICED LIKE CAVIAR
NOW I'VE LAUGHED EVERY TIME I'VE READ THIS
NOW I LOVED THOSE AMERICAN AND BRITISH BOOKS I READ
I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
I KNOW I DIDN'T
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN WE DO IN ALL OF THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS AND LOANS INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SENIOR OFFICIALS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
IN OTHER WORDS A CORONER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FATAL RECIPE
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DAD
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
IT'S NOT A LUXURY
THEY'RE NOT BEING SHIPPED UP HERE
WE'RE GOING TO EAT THESE COWS
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
DID YOU FIND THE GOLD
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS TOWARD OTHERS
AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE NICE THEY'RE POLITE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
WHEREAS GIVING AND TAKING ARE MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WHAT ARE YOUR VALUES
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
THEY'LL SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
SO NO MORE MISSING GUYS
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
I'M IN THE CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USABLE
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WE ALL WANT TO
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
A DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE AND NUTRITION
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
IS IT THAT I WRITE VERY WELL
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
THREE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T ACCESS THE INTERNET
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
BECAUSE WE CAN
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
WE ARE MAGIC
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'M PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE STRATEGIC
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRE COMPETITIVE ISSUE
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
RAISE YOUR HANDS
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
DID YOU HEAR HE HAS GONE MAD
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
THEY FEEL AT HOME
HOW IS IT MADE
IT'S A FUCKING ORGY
WHY WAS IT MADE
THE NAZIS INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
WE MOURN WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPS HERSELF
CLUSTER BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
FACED WITH ABSENCE
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HEAD
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
I DON'T CARE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DID AN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GRAIL MY ROSETTA STONE
BUT I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGES
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
I KNOW NOTHING
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORST
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
YOU MIGHT GET IMPEACHED FOR THAT
I WILL BE BACK
I'M IN TUCSON
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
I DON'T KNOW
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
IT'S THE WAR ON TERROR
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERVIEW
WE'RE ON THE GRID
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS INTO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
SO THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT SEE EYE TO EYE
HOW FAR AWAY WAS THE FINISH LINE
THIS IS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
I WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
I TEACH AT STANFORD
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HALL
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU'RE MORE CAUTIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THINGS
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
TALK TO FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
I STARTED OFF IN UGANDA
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHY
GO PICK UP THE KEYS
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMING A QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
YOU ARE A HEALER IN A STONE AGE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MY OWN WEBSITE
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHTS
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE WAS DOING OKAY
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
BETH ISRAEL'S IN BOSTON
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF TRIVIAL MATTERS
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAD ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
THAT'S MY QUESTION
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES TO THINK AHEAD STRATEGICALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
WHY NOT JUST LET BUSINESSES COMPETE
4 TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
AND GERMANY AND FRANCE
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH
WE HEAR TERRORISM
WE HEAR THE CHAOS OF WAR
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE SILENT MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
I STUDY SHAME
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE NORMS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AN AIRPLANE
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAN
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
WHAT DO YOU DO
YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
IS IT ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
IT GOES WRONG
NO NOT HOW MUCH
WHY DOES A JELLYFISH EMIT LIGHT
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
OR A FIREFLY
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
MAKE ME LAUGH
WHY DON'T THEY TRUST THE LAW
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
HAD NO IDEA
IT'S NOT TRUE
IT'S CHANGED THE WAY WE TALK
THE BOARD OF ED
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKAGES
BUT LINDA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
WE DON'T NEED MOORE'S LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
I'M A DOCTOR
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
THERE IS AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRIMSTONE EITHER
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
AND SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
HOW CAN WE DO IT
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT
WE HAVE TO GET QUIET
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THESE FORCES
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT
AFTER ALL I WAS A BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
SHOW ABUSE THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEAGUE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
THEY WANT A TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
OR WHERE DOES HE LIVE
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
I'M NOT A MILITARY BRAT
THEY SIGNED UP BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOME FORM OF REVENGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOTLINE
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
IT'S MY DAD
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY ON BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROUSEL
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME UNDER A MICROSCOPE I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT
YOU SMELL MONEY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
I HADN'T BATHED IN THREE DAYS
I DIDN'T ALWAYS SUCCEED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
AND I CRIED
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MOSQUE
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
AND IS THIS REALLY THE SOLUTION
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAVE COMING THROUGH
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW IT WRITTEN DOWN SOMEWHERE
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE DAYDREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
HE'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN FLORIDA
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
THIS IS THE ONLY PART THAT'S BATTERY BACKED UP
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITY IS COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
AGAIN IT HAD NO CHOICE
I REALIZE OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
AND THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY
YOU WOULD BE ISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
OR DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
HARNESS YOUR INTERNAL STRENGTH
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE WRONG
WE HARBOR BIAS
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
NOT A SINGLE ONE
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE
IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
HAS IT GOTTEN BETTER
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT WAS APPALLING
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
DO THEY HAVE A COMMON COLD
DO THEY HAVE AIDS
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCER TO HELP THEM
THANKS VERY MUCH
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
HOW COOL IS THAT
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX PEOPLE DIED
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
NO PLANKTON MEANS NO FISH
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO BEAR WITH ME
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WON THE GAME
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
WOMEN'S DAY WAS COMING UP
THEY CHANGE FROM PERSON TO PERSON
THEY JUST DO IT
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATIONS WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN AS A CITY
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT
IT WORKED FOR THE OAKLAND A'S AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
THEY'RE LIKE THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
NOW AT THAT TIME CAMDEN NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE IN TRENTON
I RAN THE CAMDEN POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW STICKY AND THEY WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON IT AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON A BOARD
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
IT IMPACTS SENTENCING
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
WE TOOK CAMDEN OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE SAMPLE
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WE HAVE THE PLAN
THAT'S PRETTY COOL
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT GO AWAY
SO IT'S UP TO US
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
HOW ARE YOU
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
WHAT'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY WIDENING
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINED COMPARTMENTS THESE DAYS
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
NO MORE CHARGE BEFORE USE
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
DESIGNERS ASPIRE TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD FOR ART
AND DOES IT MATTER
WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE ASPIRE TO IS THE CODE
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
I MEAN THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
WELL ARE YOU SURE
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY BB GUN
YOU CAN TRY IT
SO JUST LIKE WITH A BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
AND THEN AT 11 O'CLOCK THEY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THIS IS COMPLETELY BIZARRE
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
I KNOW IT WORKS
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
DOES THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
AND THAT'S BAD
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANY MORE CARS
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
THEY NEED SUPPORT
I STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
NOT WHAT IS IT
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I KNOW I HAVE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
IT WAS LIKE A STAR TREK EPISODE YOU KNOW
YOU SAW HIM ACT
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
HE MADE ME FEEL SMART
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
LOOK AT THE END TO SEE THE ANIMAL
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
THIS IS GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
I DON'T PAINT
AT THE SAME TIME
WHO OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
IT WOULD STOP
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD SKIP A BEAT
AND I FELT ALL THIS
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
THINK ABOUT THAT
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
AND THAT'S ALL
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
AND WORK LIKE A DOG
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I SAID WE WORK TOGETHER
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL TO 10000 FACES
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE
ARE THEY A POTENTIAL MATE
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE GAME CHANGERS REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
HE GOT PART TIME I
COME ON MAN
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AND IT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
THAT DIDN'T GO OVER REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
WHO CARES ABOUT BOSNIA
I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
TAKE MY CHILD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
AND THIS IS TRUE
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT IN YOUNGER MEN
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
SO THAT WAS EASY
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
AND HE'S A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
AND I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
I WANT TO GO
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
THEY GROW CROPS
LIKE WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
AND THIS IS CRAZY
NO ONE'S EVER SAID THAT BEFORE
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ABOUT POLIO
IT HAS TO STOP
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE DISEASES
I DO UNDERSTAND IT
LET'S HAVE THAT
WE DON'T TRUST THE MAN
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMILITY
I EVEN READ MANY SELF HELP BOOKS
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOUR DOG GETS OUTSIDE
HIS NAME IS LONNIE HODGE AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
SHE WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS GETTING
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT REALLY
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
SO WHAT DO WE DO
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTEREST
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
I WENT TO THE DEAN
WHY ARE WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WANTED TO STAY IN THIS RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
HOW COULD I LET THEM DOWN
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SYNTAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT I NEED A SURGERY LEXICON
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED SENT HOME
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMINE CYCLES
AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALS
WELL ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE ANGIOGRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
I TRIED EVERYTHING
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
SO I WENT TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I COULD
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THIS IS NONSENSE
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN AMAZON
I WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT
I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE PUSH AND PULL AND POKE AND PROD THINGS
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
NOW DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
GIVE ME INPUT
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISS PRACTICE
I SAID IN ARABIC
1 PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
I DIDN'T WANT TO
THEY HAD HIT THE JACKPOT
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
THE BOYS REMINDED ME OF HOME
LIFE IS GOOD
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
THERE'S LOVE AND THERE'S FRIENDSHIP AND THERE'S PROTECTION
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
COULD WE MERGE
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
YOU DON'T DO MUCH EDITING
DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COMEDY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
5 PERCENT TODAY
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE AD CAMPAIGN
AND THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I SAID WHERE IS HE NOW
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR ASKING
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
YOU JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WAS OXYGEN
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
HE'S FIVE YEARS OLD
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT AM I THINKING
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
WHAT IS WORTH DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
WHAT IS THAT
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
HE'S A GREAT GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TROPICS
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLED CIVILIZATION
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I LOVE RED WINE
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
IT'S A TOP PREDATOR
SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
LOTS OF MONEY
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET OUR WORLD BANK
I MADE MORE MONEY
THIS IS GREAT
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
SO LET'S START THERE
AND IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO THINK CRITICALLY
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOW THE LAWN
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WAS TERRIFIED
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE HOLY SITES
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THE ANSWER
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP POOR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I'VE DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
I'M A PROFESSOR AND WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
THE SCIENCE IS THERE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
AND THIS LEADS TO ODDITIES
I DON'T KNOW
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
I WAS LIKE WHAT
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
WHAT ABOUT YOU
DID I GET MY UPGRADE
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH YOU
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
NOW I'M READY FOR MY INTERVIEW
I'M NOT SHORT
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
I DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
SO WHY IS IT
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THERE WERE NO BACK DOORS
THE WHOLE INTERNET
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WHO WOULD I MEET
IS IT HEAVY
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEM TO LOOK FOR
WHERE WOULD IT GO
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
BUT I FOUND ONE
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
FOR AFRICANS HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
GO I SAID AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROW
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR YOU
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT IS GREAT
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WELL SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTIC
IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMAN'S FEMINISM
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO BREAK A GIRL
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I LEARNED TO WRITE LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED SUCH BRAVERY
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN HIS STOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
BUT IT'S USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ AND WRITE
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT HOW IS IT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING HISTORIC THEN AT THE RECEPTION
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING
THE GROUP GELS
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
YOU KNOW THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
LIFE IS GREAT
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
BUT I DON'T
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSES
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
SOME OF THEM GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGED PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS I AM
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
WHY IS THAT HARD
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT'S USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAS THEM
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED
SHE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOU WERE BORN TO
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANNA GET ME ONE OF THEM
I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
WHO WROTE THAT
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
HOW MUCH THEY DO
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
YES IT'S HARD
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TODAY
GOV JUST SIX PEOPLE
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF A MONOPOLY
AND IF IT'S COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT'S THE JOKE
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
SO WHAT IS AN IDEA DRAWING
YOU'RE ALL COLLECTIVE
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A HOMELESS SHELTER
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE CAN DRIVE AROUND
OKAY THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE GEIGER COUNTER
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
THIS IS HOW STUFF IS MADE MEMORABLE
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
THE ANSWER WAS NO
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
AND GUESS WHAT
WELL NOT YET
BUT WHAT DOES
STORIES ARE AMAZING
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER AT MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THEIR BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
WHAT A CONTRADICTION
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
THEY MET TOGETHER
AND NOT JUST THAT
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPRIMANDED
EFFECTIVELY THE TALIBAN CREATE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T USE VIDEO
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY CAN TAP INTO A WORKFORCE
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENDS
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
WELL NOT SO FAST
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
NOT RIGHT NOW
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WEARS OUT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ANY QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND DRYER ARE FREE
AND I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
I HAVE THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
SO THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
THE KEY HERE REALLY IS KNOWLEDGE
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
IS IT ABOUT SYSTEMS
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
HE WANTED TO SIT WHERE HE COULD SCAN THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD PLAN ESCAPE ROUTES WHERE HE COULD GET HIS HANDS
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT PIZZA
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
I HAVE RESOURCES
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THIS IS NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
WHO'S AT THE EVENT
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER TERESA
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DATE FOR ANOTHER REASON
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMAND
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
IT'S A WIN ALL AROUND
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ON
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER AID FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
THEY WERE RIGHT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THIS MAKE
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF THEY TALK LIKE JERRY SEINFELD
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WELL WHY IS THAT
WE WERE SO EXCITED
WE SAID YES
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BEAR
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
OF WINE
MAYBE THE OTHER 10 HAS SOME INDEPENDENCE IN THEIR
EXPLORING THEIR HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT VARIETALS OF WINE OUT THERE BUT FOR THE MOST PART WHEN WE THOUGHT WINE
WE THOUGHT THIS ONE FLAVOR
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THE CHOCOLATE
SUGAR AND NOTHING ELSE SO I SNAPPED OFF A COUPLE OF SQUARES POPPED THEM IN MY MOUTH AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER A PARTY
WAS A DEEPLY INSPIRING AND LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE IT WAS
NORTH
AND YOU MAY NOTICE IT'S A LITTLE DARKER THAN THE FIRST ONE
IT'S GOT A RICH DARK EARTHY FLAVOR
A LITTLE BIT OF CITRUS MARMALADE MALT
IT'S AMAZING HOW DIFFERENT IT IS
CHOCOLATE BAR RIGHT FROM THE BEANS BEANS THAT THEY SOURCE FROM MADAGASCAR THIS
SOURCING GREAT BEANS AND YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT CHOCOLATE BAR
THERE'S GONNA BE LESS PEOPLE THERE TO PRODUCE THE COCOA FOR THE INDUSTRIAL CHOCOLATE MAKERS
HAD BEEN RESEARCHING THE ART AND SCIENCE OF MAKING CHOCOLATE FROM THE BEAN SINCE BEFORE IT BECAME TRENDY
BAR FROM THE BEAN AND LEARNT THE PROCESS AND IT WAS PRETTY AWFUL
I DO HAVE A GOOD CHOCOLATE BUSINESS WHICH HAS STARTED IN 2004 AND STILL GOING STRONG
SELLING IN THE UK AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND
BUT
MY EGO WAS SOMEWHAT UNDONE BY THESE TWO SQUARES OF CHOCOLATE
I HAD A LITTLE PANG OF
A COCOA LEGEND SOME REFER TO HIM SIMPLY AS MR COCOA HE'S BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY FOR 40 YEARS
STRAWBERRY BLACK FOREST PLUM ALL THESE INCREDIBLE FLAVORS THAT I HAD NO IDEA EXISTED IN CHOCOLATE
SO I HAD TO LOOK AT THE WRAPPER AND SURE ENOUGH
IT WAS JUST 70 ORGANIC MADAGASCAN BEANS AND 30 SUGAR THE FLAVORS I WAS TASTING HAD TO HAVE BEEN COMING FROM THE BEAN ITSELF
ONE OF THE MANY ISSUES IS THAT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT UNVIABLE TO CARRY ON THE FAMILY FARM THERE'S A
90 OF THE WINE MADE FROM ONE GRAPE FROM ONE PART OF THE WORLD
PEST RESISTANT LOADS
OF
BEANS PER HECTARE IN
ONE SENSE THEY'RE PUTTING LOT OF EDUCATION AND MONEY INTO EDUCATING THE FARMERS
TO STREAMLINE THEIR OPERATIONS WHICH CAN BE A GOOD THING BUT ULTIMATELY
IT'S THE INDUSTRIAL CHOCOLATE MAKERS THAT ARE DOING THIS SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PAY A LOW PRICE AND THE WORKERS WILL
ULTIMATELY
WORK VERY HARD FOR VERY LITTLE RETURN
A CRAZY PLAN
EARLY NEXT YEAR WE AIM TO
FIND A SAILING BOAT WHERE WE CAN SAIL THE FIRST SHIPMENT OF TWO TONS OF BEANS DIRECTLY FROM BOUGAINVILLE INTO WELLINGTON HARBOR
AND I HOPE MANY OF YOU HERE TONIGHT CAN BE THERE TO WELCOME JAMES AND THE REST OF US
TO HELP SHED A POSITIVE LIGHT ON BOUGAINVILLE
AND TO SHOWCASE THE AUTONOMOUS REGION OF BOUGAINVILLE
AS A WORLD CLASS COCOA GROWING REGION
THIS MIGHT JUST HELP COCOA IS THEIR MAIN EXPORT SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT THEY GET A GOOD PRICE FOR THEIR COCOA
I HOPE THAT ONE DAY
LIKE WINE
MANY OF US HAVE OUR FAVORITE ORIGIN OF CHOCOLATE OUR FAVORITE VARIETAL AND OUR FAVORITE CHOCOLATE MAKERS
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GROWING OLDER
TO BAR I MEAN A SMALL CRAFT CHOCOLATE MAKER
THAT MAKES THE ENTIRE
CHOCOLATE FROM GETTING THE BEANS IN ROASTING THEM HAND SORTING THEM RIGHT THROUGH TO THE FINISHED PRODUCT UNDER ONE ROOF
RATHER THAN BUYING INDUSTRIAL BLOCKS OF CHOCOLATE OR BUTTONS TO MELT TO MAKE OTHER THINGS
WHICH IS THE SKILL OF A CHOCOLATIER
WE'RE CHOCOLATE MAKERS WE MAKE IT FROM THE BEAN TO THAT POINT
I DECIDED TO MOVE BACK TO MY HOMETOWN OF WELLINGTON
WITH AN AMBITION TO OPEN NEW ZEALAND'S FIRST OPEN TO THE PUBLIC FAIR TRADE AND ORGANIC
CHOCOLATE FACTORY
HE'S REPRESENTED PAPUA NEW GUINEA COCOA IN ENGLAND AND GARY TELLS ME ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS THAT HE'S EVEN SAT AT THE QUEEN'S TABLE AND HAD DINNER
JAMES AND HIS FAMILY FLED TO THE SOLOMON ISLANDS AND RETURNED IN 2002 ONCE THE WAR WAS OVER
HE'S BEEN REBUILDING EVER SINCE
WE HAD A CUP OF TEA IN HIS TRAINING SHED AND HE WAS TALKING TO ME ABOUT
HOW HE'S ABOUT TO GIVE UP IT'S BEEN TOO
HARD THESE BIG BUSINESSES HAVE LEFT HIM BY THE WAYSIDE TAKEN A LOT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE FROM WHAT I CAN TELL
AND
BEAN TO BAR CRAFT CHOCOLATE A FRIEND BOUGHT OVER A BAR FROM A SAN FRANCISCO
THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FLAVORS IN THERE THERE'S MAYBE A BIT OF FRUITINESS A BIT OF APRICOT CHARACTER BUT THAT'S JUST THE NATURAL FLAVOR OF THAT BEAN NOW I WANTED
A LITTLE BIT SOUR IT'S PERFECT YOU CAN QUITE QUICKLY SEE THAT THIS IS WHERE ALL GOOD CHOCOLATE COMES FROM THIS IS THE BASE OF WHAT WE MAKE GREAT CHOCOLATE BAR FROM BUT
HE IS A COCOA FARMER HE'S ORIGINALLY FROM NEW ZEALAND THAT HAS BEEN IN BOUGAINVILLE FOR 30 YEARS NOW
SO JAMES HAS HAD AN INCREDIBLE 40 YEARS OF COCOA
HE PLANTED HIS FIRST TREE IN 1958 HE WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN OF THE PAPUA GUINEA COCOA BOARD IN 1975
JAMES HAS WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY
TO FIND NEW AND INTERESTING FLAVORS TO EXPLORE I WITNESSED THIS FIRSTHAND
NEXT ONE I'M
GONNA ASK YOU TO PULL OUT
THE PACKET WITH THE GOLD STICKER
THIS ONE HERE IS THAT VERY SAME BEAN
AND WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR MADE INTO CHOCOLATE SO WE'VE NOT ADDED ANYTHING TO IT IT'S JUST THE PERUVIAN
CACAO BEAN
AFTER 13 YEARS IN MELBOURNE I DECIDED TO PACK UP AND TRY AND FIND THE BEST COCOA BEANS IN THE WORLD THIS LED ME MY HEART ACTUALLY LED ME TO PERU
FORESTERO GROWN IN A COUPLE OF COUNTRIES MOSTLY WEST AFRICA AND SENT TO INDUSTRIAL CHOCOLATE MAKERS WHERE IT'S MADE INTO A PRODUCT THAT WE ALL COME TO ASSOCIATE WITH CHOCOLATE
WHICH IS NOT VERY MUCH THREE US DOLLARS ROUGHLY SO REGARDLESS OF THE VARIETAL THE QUALITY IT ALL GETS PUT INTO THE SAME VAT TO MAKE OUR CONFECTIONARY WHICH YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDER AS CHOCOLATE I BET CHOCOLATE AS A FOOD
OF OUR LIVES BUT I WANT TO BEGIN BY TELLING A STORY ABOUT A GROUP OF
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE COULD CHANGE THEIR MINDSET SO WE TOOK THESE WOMEN WE SPLIT THEM INTO TWO GROUPS
WERE STRESSED THEY HAD JUST HEARD THAT TEN PERCENT OF THEIR WORKFORCE WAS GOING TO BE LAID OFF AND THEY WERE OVERWORKED WE DECIDED TO SEE IF WE COULD CHANGE THEIR MINDSET AND WE
A HAMBURGER SOME FRENCH FRIES OUR GHRELIN LEVELS DROP
BEEN WHAT PRODUCED THE EFFECTS WE KNOW THEY DIDN'T WORK ANY MORE AND THE ROOM ATTENDANTS THEMSELVES ASSURED US THAT THEY DIDN'T JOIN THE SPORTS CLUB DOWN THE STREET
DO OUR MINDSETS ABOUT STRESS DETERMINE OUR RESPONSE SO TO TEST THIS QUESTION I WORKED WITH SHAWN ACHOR AND PETER
OR SOME FAUX PROCEDURE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PLACEBO EFFECT IS THE PLACEBO EFFECT IS NOT ABOUT
WE HOOKED THEM UP TO AN IV AND THEN WE GAVE THEM A MILKSHAKE
OR LESS OF A BENEFIT DEPENDING ON HOW IT WAS CONSTRUED HERE AGAIN OUR MINDSETS PROVED TO MATTER
SO THOUGH THE CONTEXT IS DIFFERENT THE MESSAGE IS THE SAME
OF AN EFFECT DEPENDING ON OUR AWARENESS AND JUST AS IN THE CASE WHEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF EXERCISE
LATER THEY CAME BACK TO OUR LAB WE HOOKED THEM UP TO AN IV AGAIN
WHAT ARE OUR MINDSETS AND HOW MIGHT WE BEGIN TO SHIFT THEM TO
MINUTE PRESENTATION THE WHOLE GAME CHANGED PRODUCING A
OF MINDSET LIMITLESS PROBABLY NOT BUT WHAT I HOPE I'VE DONE FOR YOU TODAY IS INSPIRE YOU TO RECONSIDER WHERE THOSE LIMITS REALLY ARE BECAUSE THE TRUE TASK
TELL US TO ME IT WAS FASCINATING THAT JUST AS A RESULT
ALL TRUE BUT ORIENTED TOWARDS ONE VIEW OR THE OTHER WHAT WE FOUND WAS INTERESTING THOSE WHO WATCHED THESE
AND IS INFLUENCED BY OUR MINDSET SO
TO THE AMOUNTS OF CALORIES CONSUMED BUT THERE WAS CATCH IN THIS STUDY EVEN THOUGH THE
TREATMENT FOR THORACIC SURGERY BUT DR BENEDETTI AND HIS COLLEAGUES MADE A
A ROBUST AND GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT STRESS CAN HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ENHANCING EFFECTS ON OUR HEALTH OUR WELL BEING AND OUR PERFORMANCE
MAKEUP OF FATS NUTRIENTS BUT WHAT WE BELIEVE WHAT WE EXPECT WHAT WE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE POWER OF MINDSET
AND KNOW THAT JUST LIKE THIS
IN JUST THE BLINK OF AN EYE WE CAN CHANGE THE GAME OF ANY FACET OF OUR LIFE QUITE SIMPLY BY CHANGING OUR MINDSET
THANK YOU
MATTER IT DOES BUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF ANYTHING IN OUR LIVES
BAD STRESS NOW THIS IS NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING THAT
EFFECTS ON BOTH THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR WELL BEING PRESUMABLY WITHOUT EVEN CHANGING BEHAVIOR NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T CHANGE
IN ITALY DR FABRIZIO BENEDETTI AND HIS COLLEAGUES STUDIED A GROUP OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING THORACIC SURGERY
TO DESIGN
WHAT I REALLY CARE ABOUT
IS THE WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY INTERACTS WITH PEOPLE AND SOCIETY
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC
WITH RELEVANCE TO PERSUASION
I WANT TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT
WE ACT AGAINST OUR WILL OUR CONSCIOUS WILL
WHEN WE EAT THAT LUSCIOUS DESSERT
THAT'S IN FRONT OF US THAT WE KNOW
VIOLATES OUR DIET
IN ORDER TO STOP EATING THIS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE IN CONSCIOUSNESS
THE PROHIBITION TO ACT
YEARS AGO I WROTE A PAPER ABOUT THIS WITH TIM SHALLICE A NEUROSCIENTIST
WE ACTUALLY DECIDED THAT
IT ALSO CHANGED AN OUTLOOK WE WERE NO LONGER PEOPLE WE WERE CONSUMERS THE JOB OF THE CONSUMER IS TO CONSUME
RADIO AND TELEVISION OR THINGS THAT WERE SUBSIDIZED LIKE NEWSPAPERS SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE FULL COST WE THOUGHT THAT WAS NOT A BAD TRADE OFF WE KNEW WHAT THE TRADE OFF WAS IT WAS ADVERTISEMENT
ME START BY EXAMINING SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
NAMELY
ALL THE FORCES THAT ARE ALLIED AGAINST US
ASKING US TO DO THINGS AGAINST OUR WILL
IN TWO DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF THE WORD WILL
SO WILL IS
THINGS THAT WE DON'T WISH TO DO
THINGS THAT
WE DECIDE WE DON'T WISH TO DO BUT WE END UP DOING THEM
OR AGAINST OUR WILL AS IN FREE WILL WHERE WE ARE PERSUADED
OF THE AUTOMOBILE WOULD CHANGE THERE'LL BE NEW FEATURES EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS THERE'LL BE A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE AUTOMOBILES SO THAT IT WAS VERY VISIBLE TO OTHER
WORLDS SUPERCOMPUTERS NOW ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE OF YOU
IF YOU WANT SUPERCOMPUTER YOU SIMPLY GO TO AMAZON
BECAUSE AMAZON SELLS BOOKS AND THEY SELL THINGS TO DO THAT THEY NEED HUGE AMOUNT OF COMPUTERS BEHIND TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEING BOUGHT WHAT'S BEING SOLD WHAT'S IN INVENTORY AND TO HELP YOU BUY BY SAYING OH
I SEE YOU LOOKED AT THIS PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMILAR TO YOU HAVE PURCHASED THIS OR LOOKED AT THESE OTHER DEVICES SO WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AT THOSE TOO
NOW THAT COMPUTER POWER IS BEING USED ALL THE TIME
SO AMAZON WILL SELL IT TO YOU
TODAY IN SILICON VALLEY MOST START UPS DON'T BOTHER TO BUY COMPUTERS THEY BORROW THEIR TIME FROM AMAZON THEY BORROW THEIR MEMORY FROM AMAZON BECAUSE THAT WAY IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE IF YOU NEED TO PUT TOGETHER 1 MILLION PROCESSORS
YOU CAN DO IT
YOU CAN DO IT ITS PROCESSORS FOR RENT SO YOU CAN DO INCREDIBLE THINGS
SO THE REVOLUTION IS A LOT OF THINGS IT'S COMPUTATION COMMUNICATION DISPLAYS
DID'T HAVE NEW THING YOU WERE SHAMED
AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS HELPED INCREASE THE SHAME THE ADVERTISEMENTS WERE SOMETIMES SUBTLE
BECAUSE THEY WERE SOMETIMES THE CONTENTS OF THE MEDIA THAT WE WERE WATCHING OR LISTENING TO
RADIO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINE AND THEN LATER ON TELEVISION
WE ARE CONSUMERS
YOU EAT ONE POTATO CHIP OR DO YOU START EATING THE POTATO CHIPS AND FINISH THE BAG
WELL IT'S NOT ACCIDENTAL THE POTATO CHIPS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED
TO INDUCE THIS CRAVING FOR MORE AND MORE AND MORE
DESIGNED THROUGH THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE PUT INTO THEM THAT WILL AFFECT THE HORMONAL BALANCE AND DESIGNED BY THE SOFT
NECESSARILY BECAUSE WE LIKE IT BUT BECAUSE WE WANT OTHERS TO SEE IT IN OUR PLAYLIST OR WE BUY NEW AUTOMOBILE BECAUSE THE OLD ONE IS OLD AND PEOPLE WILL THINK BADLY OF US OR EVEN THE WAY WE DRESS
THE AREAS I HAVE COMBINED IN MYSELF I STARTED OFF AS AN ENGINEER AND THEN BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST AND THEN HELPED FOUND THIS COGNITIVE SCIENCE FIELD AND THEN
AND PERHAPS A POSSIBLE RESISTANCE
OBSERVING SPYING CORRELATING
DATA MINING
SO THE STORY HAS CHANGED RATHER DRAMATICALLY LET ME TALK ABOUT AN ARTIFICIAL COMPANY
SUPPOSE WE HAVE A COMPANY AND I'LL CALL IT BUOGLE
NOW BUOGLE MAKES MANY THINGS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO USE IT FOR FREE
THEIR
SEARCH SPECIALIZED SEARCH FOR AUTHORS AIRLINE FLIGHTS HOTELS COMPARISON SHOPPING RESTAURANTS
BUOGLE ALSO MAKES AVAILABLE CLOUD BASED DOCUMENTS SPREADSHEETS DRAWING PACKAGES 2D
WE'RE GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES TO CONNECT TO LONG LOST FRIENDS AND MAKE NEW ONES WHO SEEM TO SHARE OUR INTERESTS ALL THESE SERVICES ARE FREE WE DON'T PAY FOR THEM ISN'T IT REALLY NEAT
BUT I'M GOING TO REMIND YOU I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME DESIGN THEORY WHICH ACTUALLY COMES FROM COGNITIVE SCIENCE WHICH I WILL USE TO TALK ABOUT THE
THE GREAT RECESSION IN 2007 AND
PUBLISHED AGAIN A PREDICTION IN ADVANCE
STATING THAT BY AUGUST 2009
THE MARKET WILL CORRECT WILL NOT CONTINUE ON THIS TRACK
OUR CRITICS READING THE PREDICTION
SAID
NO
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS THERE THEY HAVE LEARNED THEIR LESSON
THEY WILL CONTROL
VERY TRENCHANT NOT SUSTAINABLE
AND THE KEY IDEA IS THAT THE MATHEMATICAL SOLUTION OF THIS CLASS OF MODELS
EXHIBIT FINITE TIME SINGULARITIES WHICH MEANS
THAT THERE IS A CRITICAL TIME WHERE THE SYSTEM WILL BREAK WILL CHANGE REGIME IT MAY BE A CRASH IT MAY BE JUST A PLATEAU SOMETHING ELSE AND THE KEY IDEA IS THAT THE CRITICAL TIME
THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITICAL TIME IS CONTAINED IN THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SUPER EXPONENTIAL GROWTH
THE POINT IS THAT MANY TIMES DURING BUBBLES THERE ARE POSITIVE FEEDBACKS
WHICH CAN BE OF MANY TIMES SUCH THAT
PREVIOUS GROWTHS ENHANCE
PUSH FORWARD
INCREASE THE NEXT GROWTH THROUGH THIS KIND OF SUPER EXPONENTIAL GROWTH
OF THE FACT THAT WHEN AN INSTABILITY HAS DEVELOPED AND THE SYSTEM IS RIPE ANY PERTURBATION MAKES IT ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL
THE ROOT MECHANISM OF A DRAGON KING IS A SLOW MATURATION TOWARDS INSTABILITY WHICH IS THE BUBBLE AND THE CLIMAX OF THE BUBBLE IS OFTEN THE CRASH
MORE SURPRISINGLY THE SAME TYPE OF THEORY APPLIES TO BIOLOGY AND
WE HAD A GLOBAL BUBBLE
HELP THE PATIENT TO DEAL WITH THIS ILLNESS WE HAVE APPLIED THIS THEORY TO MANY SYSTEMS LANDSLIDES GLACIER COLLAPSE EVEN TO THE DYNAMICS OF PREDICTION OF SUCCESS BLOCKBUSTERS
GIVING BIRTH TO THE BABY THE DRAGON KING SO IF YOU MEASURE
UNKNOWABILITY THAT THE EXTREME EVENTS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY UNKNOWABLE
NOTHING CAN BE FURTHER FROM THE DRAGON KING CONCEPT I PROPOSE WHICH IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE THAT MOST EXTREME EVENTS ARE ACTUALLY KNOWABLE AND PREDICTABLE
SO WE CAN BE EMPOWERED AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT
RELEASE THE REPORT
AND THERE IS AUTHENTICATION
AND ALL THIS IS DONE ON AN INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVE SO THAT WE CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF JUST RELEASING THE SUCCESSES
LET ME TEASE YOU
WITH A VERY RECENT ANALYSIS
17TH OF MAY 2013 JUST TWO WEEKS
REMEMBER BLACK SWAN IS THIS RARE BIRD THAT YOU SEE ONCE AND SUDDENLY SHATTERED YOUR BELIEF THAT ALL SWANS SHOULD BE WHITE SO IT HAS CAPTURED THE IDEA OF
CRISIS DID OCCUR THE MARKET CORRECTED THE SAME CRITICS THEN SAID AH YES BUT YOU PUBLISHED YOUR
{NS} ONCE UPON A TIME WE LIVED IN AN ECONOMY OF FINANCIAL GROWTH AND PROSPERITY
WORK
WE WRITE A REPORT
IN WHICH WE PUT OUR PREDICTION OF THE CRITICAL TIME
WE DON'T RELEASE THE REPORT IT'S KEPT SECRET
BUT WITH MODERN ENCRYPTING TECHNIQUES WE HAVE A HASH WE PUBLISH A PUBLIC KEY
AND SIX MONTHS LATER
EXTREMES AND CRISES LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION OR THE EUROPEAN CRISIS TAKE US BY SURPRISE
THERE ARE BUBBLES EVERYWHERE
FROM ONE SIDE THIS IS EXCITING FOR ME AS A PROFESSOR WHO CHASES BUBBLES AND SLAYS DRAGONS
AS THE MEDIA HAS SOMETIMES CALLED ME
BUT CAN WE REALLY SLAY THE DRAGONS
VERY RECENTLY WITH COLLABORATORS
NOT THE CASE THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAPS OF MANKIND WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO STEER OUR SOCIETIES AND OUR PLANET TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY IN THE
THE FINANCIAL PRICE TIME SERIES A GIVEN STOCK YOUR
YOU BELIEVE
THE VERY SMART
VERY MOTIVATED VERY INFORMED
MACRO HEDGE FUND MANAGERS
REACTED TO THIS PREDICTION
YOU KNOW THEY HAD MADE BILLIONS JUST SURFING THIS BUBBLE UNTIL NOW
THEY TOLD ME DIDIER
YEAH THE MARKET MIGHT BE OVERVALUED BUT YOU FORGET SOMETHING
IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE FAILURE OF QUANTITATIVE EASING AS WELL AS AUSTERITY MEASURES AS LONG AS WE DON'T ATTACK THE CORE THE STRUCTURAL CAUSE OF THIS PERPETUAL MONEY MACHINE
UP THE DISCUSSION AT THE SIZE OF THE PLANET WE SEE THE SAME THING WHEREVER WE LOOK IT'S
THERE IS A PROBLEM OF SELF FULFILLING PROPHESIES SO WE INVENTED A NEW WAY OF DOING SCIENCE WE CREATED
2007 I WAS INVITED AS A KEYNOTE SPEAKER OF A MACRO HEDGE FUND MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE AND I SHOWED TO THE CONFERENCE A PREDICTION
DOES IT MEAN IMAGINE YOU HAVE AN INVESTMENT THAT RETURNS THE FIRST YEAR FIVE PERCENT THE SECOND YEAR 10 PERCENT THE THIRD YEAR 20 PERCENT THE NEXT YEAR 40 PERCENT IS THAT NOT MARVELOUS
GIVES HOPE WE LEARN THAT MOST SYSTEMS HAVE POCKETS OF PREDICTABILITY IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ADVANCE
WHERE I REALLY ALMOST TEARED UP ON A COUPLE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING POWERFUL WHEN YOU CAN GET UP ON A STAGE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE CONVEY WHAT MAKES YOUR HEART BEAT AND MAKE THEIR HEART BEAT WHICH IS AMAZING SO THE SPEAKERS HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC
THROUGH AND APPLYING ALL YOUR ANALYTICS YOU JUST SAY YES TO IT AND I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU CAN APPLY THAT TO YOUR LIFE SO MANY THINGS WILL HAPPEN NOT ALWAYS GREAT THINGS {LG} BUT
IT IN DAYTON BECAUSE I GREW UP IN TIPP CITY AND I ALWAYS HAD SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART FOR DAYTON ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU MOVE TO A BIG CITY LIKE CHICAGO AND YOU REALIZE THAT'S WHAT A CITY CAN BE WE'VE GOT ONE IN OHIO THAT IS KIND OF BLANK AND READY TO ROLL
SO I WANTED TO MOVE BACK AND I
LOOK GUYS HERE IS THE LAST THING I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU AND IT IS SIMPLY THIS
DON'T COME TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SOMEONE WHO IS IMPORTANT THAT DOESN'T MATTER IN DAYTON BECAUSE NO ONE IN DAYTON IS IMPORTANT OK
I'VE BEEN OPENED FOR A YEAR AND I'M ALMOST THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN DAYTON AND I'VE NOT TRIED IT AT ALL IT'S NOT IMPORTANT THAT YOU RUB SHOULDERS WITH PEOPLE HERE IS WHAT IT'S IMPORTANT
MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOORS TODAY YOU TAKE SOMETHING FROM HERE AND YOU SAY I'M GOING TO GO AND DO THAT THAT'S WHAT I DID I SAID I'M GOING TO OPEN A THEATER I DID NONE OF YOU CAME I'M OVER IT
BUT I DID SOMETHING AND SO CAN YOU THIS IS WHAT THIS GROUP IS LOOK AROUND EXCEPT FOR THE ONE PERSON THAT'S OVER 75 AND IS PROBABLY ASLEEP
LOOK AROUND
IT S ALL A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT THE CITY CARE ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THANK
AND I OWN THE BLACK BOX IMPROV THEATER IN DAYTON OHIO
COLLEGE AGED STUDENTS WHO WANT TO TRANSFER OR THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO WANT TO FIND A COLLEGE
I LOVED MY EXPERIENCE AT WITTENBERG
AND I SPECIFICALLY LOVED ONE EXPERIENCE IN GENERAL WHICH WAS MY CLASS IMPROVISATION FOR THE THEATER WITH DR CORWIN GEORGES
I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU DID SOMETHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU REALIZED AH THAT'S ME THAT'S MY JAM THIS IS THE THING THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO IN MY LIFE
IF YOU'VE HAD THAT THING AND THAT THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IN YOUR LIFE MAKES YOU MONEY GOOD FOR YOU
BECAUSE
IMPROV DOES NOT
EVEN NOW
AT ONE POINT
SOME TIME AGO TO OPEN AN IMPROV THEATER
I'VE
DONE IMPROV SINCE 2002
I WAS AT WITTENBERG UNIVERSITY
JUST A FEW OF US BECAUSE THE REST OF US HAVE JOBS THAT ARE MAKING MONEY
IT'S A WITTENBERG
AND THE MOST EFFICIENT AND THE MOST DAZZLING GADGET YOU CAN HAVE WHILE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE WORLD
PEOPLE FROM GETTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SO IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD DO THAT WOULD BE
OR YOUR SERVICE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A HUGE BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM TO GET IT
NEW SORT OF APPROACH GIVE US THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THERE PART OF EVERY SOCIETY THAT'S DEPRIVED OF ENOUGH
SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE ON THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WAITING TIME
CELL PHONE ANY GADGET YOU CAN BRING THEM THEY CAN FIX IT AND IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE BECAUSE
WE DO WITH THIS CAN WE MAKE A LITTLE PRODUCT OR A SERVICE OUT OF IT SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
WAS AN ISSUE WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MUCH BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE OFTEN THE
AND THAT'S WHAT IS ALL REQUIRED WITH LITTLE BIT OF LOCAL TINKERING TALENT TO CONVERT THE DEVICE INTO SOMETHING
NOISY THEY ARE KIDS WHO SCREAM AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO GET ABOVE THAT
IT'S AN INFORMAL SCHOOL BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOLISTIC EDUCATION THE ONLY THING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE IS ACCESS TO RESOURCES THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A TEXTBOOK SOMETIMES AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A PROPER
MORE {NS} THE DATA ON A LITTLE USB KEY BY SURFACE MAIL IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW DAYS TO GET THERE BUT AT LEAST IT GETS THERE IN HIGH DEFINITION AND IN A RELIABLE
THIS MORNING AND YOU CAN GO PICK IT UP AFTER LUNCH AND IT WAS QUITE INCREDIBLE
THE CIRCUITRY RE FLASH THE FIRMWARE DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO WITH THE PHONE AND THEY CAN FIX ANYTHING SO QUICKLY YOU CAN HAND OVER A
THE THREE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS CONVERSION FROM THIS GUY TO THIS GUY
TECHNOLOGY TODAY IS MOSTLY ABOUT A CULTURE OF EXCESS IT'S
THESE THINGS IT JUST CHANGES THE WAY THE ECONOMICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH CARE WORKS AND IT CHANGES THE WAY SYSTEMS ACTUALLY FUNCTION NOT JUST
ON A SYSTEMATIC PLANNING LEVEL BUT ALSO
IN VERY GRASSROOTS BOTTOM UP LEVEL
SO THAT'S IT AND WE HOPE TO DO THIS IN BIG WAY
AROUND WE WENT AND SCAVENGED THE NEARBY MARKETS AND WE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN WE PICK UP THAT WILL MAKE THIS HAPPEN
EDUCATION AND ALL THESE KINDS OF VERY FUNDAMENTAL
AN INTERESTING FILTER BUT NOT JUST A FILTER A REALLY WELL THOUGHT THROUGH REFERRAL
ELECTRICITY OR ERRATIC ELECTRICITY AND THE OTHER KEY THING THAT WE DID WAS MAKE THIS BOX RUN OFF A USB
AND IF IT ACTUALLY MAKES AN IMPACT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS WE ARE TRYING TO SCALE THIS
PEOPLE TO BASICALLY HOW TO LEAD A BETTER LIFE BUT ALSO TO DIVERT OR SORT OF MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS OF WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE SHOULD THEY APPROACH THEY ARE BASICALLY REFERRAL SERVICES ESSENTIALLY
OF TINY LITTLE PARTS IT'S NOT EASY YOU'VE GOT TO TRY IT ON YOUR OWN TO BELIEVE IT BUT WHAT FUELS
REACH THE MOST BASIC OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO EVEN ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS IN LIFE
SPAN IT TOOK ME WHILE WHEN I TALKED TO THEM TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT ONCE I UNDERSTOOD IT I COULD MAKE ANYBODY
GOING ON THE GOOD THING IS SINCE THE
SCHOOLS AND THE PLACES CHANGED EVERY TIME I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO
FIND THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE ROOM
MAKE SURE THAT HE HELPS ME THAT WE GET SOME KIND OF COLLABORATION GOING ON AND TRY TO GET THROUGH SCHOOL THROUGH THE CLASS
THAT'S HOW IT PRETTY MUCH WENT WE WENT FROM THE THEORY TO ME PITCHING IT TO OTHER PEOPLE MAKING SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS OUR PRODUCTS WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT
LEAD TO THE NEXT PIG COUGHING AND SNEEZING UNTIL AN OUTBREAK OF SWINE FLU HAS TAKEN OVER YOUR FARM IF IT'S A BAD ENOUGH VIRUS THE HEALTH OF YOUR HERD MAY BE GONE IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE IF YOU CALLED IN A VETERINARIAN HE OR SHE WOULD VISIT YOUR
A QUESTION BASED ON DNA WE ACTUALLY DON'T NEED TO READ ALL THOSE THREE BILLION LETTERS TYPICALLY THAT WOULD BE LIKE GETTING HUNGRY AT NIGHT AND HAVING TO FLIP THROUGH THE WHOLE PHONE BOOK FROM COVER TO COVER PAUSING AT EVERY LINE JUST TO FIND THE NEAREST
A
COLLEGE STUDENT ARMED WITH A PERSONAL COMPUTER COULD CODE AN APP AN APP THAT IS NOW A SOCIAL NETWORK WITH MORE THAN ONE BILLION USERS
COULD WE BE MOVING INTO A WORLD OF ONE PERSONAL DNA MACHINE
IN EVERY HOME
I KNOW FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING IN THIS REALITY
AGO TOGETHER WITH A FELLOW BIOLOGIST AND FRIEND OF MINE ZEKE ALVAREZ SAAVEDRA WE DECIDED TO MAKE PERSONAL DNA MACHINES THAT ANYONE COULD USE
OUR GOAL WAS TO BRING DNA SCIENCE TO MORE PEOPLE IN NEW PLACES
WE STARTED WORKING IN OUR BASEMENTS
WE HAD A SIMPLE QUESTION
WHAT COULD THE WORLD LOOK LIKE IF EVERYONE COULD ANALYZE DNA WE WERE CURIOUS
AS CURIOUS AS YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I HAD
WHETHER OUR FOOD IS SAFE TO EAT OR WHETHER IT'S CONTAMINATED WITH DEADLY BACTERIA EVEN JUDGES USE THE OUTPUT OF THESE MACHINES IN COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS INNOCENT OR GUILTY BASED ON DNA EVIDENCE THE INVENTOR OF THIS DNA COPYING TECHNIQUE WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY IN 1993
BUT
A 16 YEAR OLD DESIGNING A DNA EXPERIMENT TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF ASTRONAUTS MAY SEEM LIKE A RARITY
THE MARK OF A CHILD GENIUS
WELL TO ME IT SIGNALS SOMETHING BIGGER
THAT DNA TECHNOLOGY IS FINALLY WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERY ONE OF
MOLECULE THE CARRIES GENETIC INSTRUCTIONS THAT HELP BUILD THE LIVING WORLD
HUMANS HAVE DNA
PIGS HAVE DNA
EVEN BACTERIA AND SOME VIRUSES HAVE DNA TOO THE GENETIC INSTRUCTIONS ENCODED IN DNA INFORM HOW OUR BODIES DEVELOP GROW FUNCTION AND IN MANY CASES THAT SAME INFORMATION CAN TRIGGER DISEASE
NEW TECHNOLOGY MIGHT TAKE US AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR PERSONAL DNA TECHNOLOGY TODAY FOR EXAMPLE I COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED
THERE LACKED THE BASIC TOOLS TO DETECT AND COMBAT DISEASE RESULTS COULD TAKE UP TO A WEEK TO COME BACK THAT'S WAY TOO LONG FOR THE PATIENTS AND THE FAMILIES WHO ARE
AND IT'S AT TIMES LIKE THIS THAT PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION IS BOUND TO HAPPEN MOMENTS WHEN A TRANSFORMATIVE POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS BEFORE LIMITED TO A SELECT FEW IN THE IVORY TOWER FINALLY BECOMES WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERY ONE OF US
FROM FARMERS TO SCHOOLCHILDREN
THINK ABOUT THE MOMENT
IAN GOODFELLOW IS A VIROLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE LAST YEAR HE TRAVELED TO SIERRA LEONE WHEN THE EBOLA OUTBREAK BROKE OUT IN WESTERN AFRICA HE QUICKLY REALIZED THAT
ARE THIS DELICACY THAT STEMS FROM A FUNGUS GROWING ON THE ROOTS OF LIVING TREES AND IT'S A RARE FUNGUS SOME SPECIES MAY FETCH 3000 7000 OR MORE DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM
MILES PER HOUR PICTURE THAT YOU'RE SEEING 15 SUNSETS AND SUNRISES EVERY DAY YOU'RE ALSO LIVING IN MICROGRAVITY
AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF COPIES UNTIL THAT GENE STANDS OUT AGAINST THE REST UNTIL WE CAN VISUALIZE IT INTERPRET IT READ IT UNDERSTAND IT UNTIL WE CAN ANSWER DOES MY PIG HAVE THE FLU
IS STILL TINY AND SURROUNDED BY SO MUCH OTHER DNA THAT WHAT THESE MACHINES THEN DO IS COPY THE TARGET GENE AND ONE COPY PILES ON TOP OF ANOTHER
PUTTING IT IN A TEST TUBE MIXING IT WITH CHEMICALS TO EXTRACT DNA AND THEN USING THEIR HOME DNA COPIER TO TEST THOSE TOMATOES FOR GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TRAITS
IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE PIG FARMER YOU LIVE ON A SMALL FARM IN THE PHILIPPINES YOUR ANIMALS ARE YOUR FAMILY'S SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME AS LONG AS THEY'RE HEALTHY YOU KNOW THAT ANY DAY
IN ORDER TO GROW THE HIGHEST QUALITY TRUFFLES THE ONES THAT CHEFS ALL OVER THE WORLD WILL FIGHT OVER PAUL HAS TO USE DNA ANALYSIS ISN'T THAT MIND BLOWING I
A DROP OF THAT GENETIC MATERIAL AND PUT IT INTO A LITTLE ANALYZER SMALLER THAN A SHOEBOX PROGRAM IT TO DETECT DNA OR RNA FROM THE SWINE FLU VIRUS AND WITHIN ONE HOUR GET BACK THE RESULTS VISUALIZE THE RESULTS
SCHOOL STUDENT FROM NEW YORK ANNA SOPHIA BOGURAEV WONDERED WHETHER CHANGES TO THE DNA OF ASTRONAUTS COULD BE RELATED TO THIS IMMUNE SUPPRESSION AND THROUGH A SCIENCE COMPETITION CALLED GENES IN SPACE
ANNA SOPHIA DESIGNED AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING A PERSONAL DNA MACHINE ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE
INSTEAD IAN COULD USE PERSONAL DNA MACHINES SMALL ENOUGH TO BE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE AIR CONDITIONING UNIT TO KEEP SEQUENCING THE VIRUS AND KEEP SAVING LIVES
THE RIPPLES OF THE PERSONAL DNA REVOLUTION MAY BE HARD TO PREDICT
BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN
REVOLUTIONS DON'T GO BACKWARDS
AND DNA TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY SPREADING FASTER THAN OUR IMAGINATION
SO IF YOU'RE CURIOUS GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH DNA TODAY
IT IS IN OUR DNA TO BE CURIOUS
AND UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OUR BODIES CAN DO FUNKY THINGS ONE OF THESE THINGS IS THAT OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS GET SUPPRESSED MAKING ASTRONAUTS MORE PRONE
ABILITY TO MAKE COPIES OF DNA AS SIMPLE AS IT SOUNDS HAS TRANSFORMED OUR WORLD SCIENTISTS USE IT EVERY DAY TO DETECT
AND ADDRESS DISEASE TO CREATE INNOVATIVE MEDICINES TO MODIFY FOODS
MAY BE JUST ENOUGH TIME FOR INFECTION TO SPREAD AND TAKE AWAY YOUR WAY OF LIFE BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY TODAY FARMERS CAN TAKE THOSE SAMPLES THEMSELVES THEY
ON THE INCREDIBLY POPULAR NETFLIX SHOW ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK NOW I OFTEN TALK ABOUT LAVERNE COX BECAUSE SHE HAS
WHAT'S AMAZING RIGHT NOW AND POTENTIALLY SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THAT TIME MAGAZINE PIECE TALKED ABOUT THE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT THE INTERNET ALLOWS TRANS FOLKS TO ACCESS EACH OTHER IN WAYS THAT'S AMAZING
THE TERM TRANSEXUAL IN A MINUTE BUT I'LL START WITH TRANSVESTITE SO THE TERM TRANSVESTITE WAS USED WIDELY IN THE 60S AND 70S
CONNECT WITH FOLKS WHO SHARED YOUR IDENTITIES OR SHARED INTERESTS THAT YOU HAD SO YOU HAD YOUR OWN PERSONAL BLOG PAGE BUT YOU ALSO HAD A SPACE WHERE YOU COULD JOIN COMMUNITY
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES SAYING YEAH YOU DO THAT BUT IT'S BEING ACTIVE AND INVOLVED
SO WAYS THAT YOU CAN BE AN ALLY INVOLVE SHOWING UP AT TRANS EVENTS
OMAHA HAS A LARGE AND THRIVING TRANS COMMUNITY AND WE DO STUFF
FEEL FREE TO COME WHEN YOU'RE INVITED WE'D LOVE TO HAVE FOLKS COME TO TRANSGENDER EVENTS
SPEAK UP FOR US WHEN WE CAN'T MAYBE DO IT FOR OURSELVES
DON'T SPEAK OVER
A LONG TIME
UNTIL I WAS ABOUT 23 24 YEARS OLD
SO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE IN YOUR 30S
THE OLD FOLKS IN THE ROOM TO THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER AN EARLY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM CALLED LIVEJOURNAL
LIVEJOURNAL WAS
LOTS OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF THE WAY THAT FOLKS CAN MEDICALLY TRANSITION
BUT I'LL ALSO PUT A CAVEAT IN HERE
THAT MEDICAL TRANSITION IS EXPENSIVE
IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER HEALTH INSURANCE OFTEN SO IT'S OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OFTEN MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES
AND THIS CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM 5000 DOLLARS ON THE LOW END OF THE VARIOUS SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE OUT THERE UPWARDS
TO 30000 50000 DOLLARS FOR JUST ONE PROCEDURE
SO THIS IS COST PROHIBITIVE OFTEN AS WELL FOR SOME FOLKS SO IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE NOT EVERY TRANS PERSON GOES THROUGH A TRANSITION IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
BUT LET'S GET BACK TO SOME OF THE WORDS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ON THAT EARLIER SLIDE AND LET'S GET BACK TO SOME HISTORICAL WORDS THAT YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT THE TRANS COMMUNITY
TYPICALLY FEMALE CLOTHES
BUT COMBINES THOSE FEMININE ATTRIBUTES OCCASIONALLY WITH COMPLETELY ROCKING OUT A MUSTACHE AND A GOATEE
BECAUSE FOR HER SHE'S NOT JUST FEMININE
AND TO THINK ABOUT HERSELF IN JUST THAT NARROW WAY SEEMS INAUTHENTIC TO HER
FOR US
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S UNSAFE FOR US TO SPEAK OUT AND CALL SOMEONE WHEN THEY'RE DOING STUFF THAT'S A LITTLE TRANSPHOBIC
SO YOU MIGHT BE BETTER POSITIONED TO DO THAT THAN I MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE REALLY UNHEALTHY FOR ME TO DO THAT BUT YOU COULD DO THAT WITH RELATIVE EASE
AND ALSO NOW THAT YOU KNOW BETTER
DO BETTER
AND HELP ALL OF US NOT JUST SOME OF US BREAK THROUGH
THANK YOU
CLAIM IT ALMOST LIKE A NOUN ALLY IS NO LONGER NOUN ALLY IS MORE THOUGHT ABOUT AS A VERB ALLY IS SOMETHING THAT YOU EARN YOU DO SOMETHING TO BECOME AN ALLY YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT AN
BUT I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE THE TRANS DICTIONARY IS NOT COMPLETE AND
IT'S CHANGING SO IF THESE WORDS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THESE BEFORE
I'M NOT SURPRISED
RIGHT NOW ONLINE
THE TRANS COMMUNITY IS STILL MAKING NEW WORDS TO DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND DESCRIBE
THEIR OWN IDEAS ABOUT THEIR GENDER IDENTITY
ONE DAY WHILE I WAS JUST ROAMING THROUGH LIVEJOURNAL BORED AFTER CLASS
I FOUND A PAGE DEDICATED TO TALKING ABOUT FTM
TRANS PEOPLE I FOUND A BLOG ENTRY BY THIS KID WHO WAS MY SAME AGE AND HIS NAME WAS BLAKE
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND HIS GENDER IDENTITY AND THE WORDS THAT HE USED TO DESCRIBE IT
AND HIS JOURNEY ON HOW HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT MEANT TO BE A TRANSGENDER PERSON AND
THE 1960S
THOUGH IT DIDN'T REALLY GET ADOPTED FOR WIDE USE UNTIL THE LATE 1980S TO 1990S
AND THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF TRANSGENDER OUT THERE BUT MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS THE ONE THAT'S ON THE SCREEN
THIS IS FROM SUSAN STRYKER SHE'S A TRANS AUTHOR HISTORIAN ACTIVIST
AND SHE SAYS THAT HER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD
WAS A NEW YORK CITY BASED GROUP THAT ADVOCATED FOR YOUNG TRANS QUEER PEOPLE OF COLOR FOLKS WHO WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADVOCATE FOR THE CAUSE
EVOLVES AND CHANGES OVER TIME SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE TERMS THAT WERE ON THAT EARLIER SLIDE AND I'LL START WITH THE TERM TRANSGENDER TRANSGENDER WAS
WITHIN THE COURSE OF THAT ONE BLOG ENTRY MY WHOLE IDEA OF MYSELF SHIFTED I HAD FINALLY FOUND LANGUAGE I HAD FINALLY FOUND THE WORDS TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF THROUGH THE WORDS OF SOMEONE ELSE I HAD NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE AND
WAS BORN FEMALE ASSIGNED AT BIRTH AND WAS RAISED ACCORDINGLY
BUT IT DOES HIGHLIGHT
THAT YOU CAN MOVE AWAY FROM THAT
AND OFTEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANS FOLKS MOVING AWAY FROM THAT UNCHOSEN STARTING POINT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRANSITION
AND THE TERM TRANSITION CAN MEAN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S NO ONE WAY TO TRANSITION AND THERE'S NO ONE RIGHT WAY TO BE TRANS
I WAS RAISED IN ALABAMA
WHICH IF ANY OF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SOUTH THE SOUTH HAS VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT GENDER
VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MASCULINE OR FEMININE OR MALE OR FEMALE
AND I DIDN'T REALLY FIT INTO THOSE IDEAS
AND THAT WAS OK FOR A WHILE I EXISTED IN SORT OF A TOMBOY SPACE FOR MOST OF MY YOUNG ADULTHOOD OR MY YOUNG CHILDHOOD
AND I DIDN'T GET A LOT OF FLACK FOR THAT I WASN'T REALLY BULLIED ALL THAT MUCH
UNTIL ABOUT MIDDLE SCHOOL JUNIOR HIGH
AND THAT'S REALLY WHEN I GOT THE VERY CLEAR MESSAGE THAT I WAS NOT PERFORMING MY GENDER IN THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE EXPECTED ME TO
AND I TRIED TO MODIFY IT I TRIED TO MEET PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS
BUT I JUST FAILED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
TRANSSEXUAL CON TEMPORARILY IS STILL USED AND IT REFERS TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO UNDERGO MEDICAL TRANSITION OR WHO HAS UNDERGONE MEDICAL TRANSITION
AND TRANSSEXUAL IS A WORD THAT HAS A LOT OF BAGGAGE FOR THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY SOME FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY SAY THAT'S THE WORD THAT I USE THAT'S HOW I UNDERSTAND MY GENDER OTHER FOLKS SAY I REALLY DISLIKE THAT WORD IT MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
AND I TEND TO FALL ON
WORKS AT LOCAL NONPROFIT THAT WORKS WITH HIGH SCHOOL GAY STRAIGHT ALLIANCES
AND FOR HER BEING A NON BINARY TRANS WOMAN MEANS THAT SHE BLURS THE LINE OF FEMININITY
SHE MOSTLY PRESENTS IN RELATIVELY FEMININE WAYS
SHE GOES BY A FEMININE NAME
AND BECAUSE THESE TRANS FOLKS ARE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH ONE ANOTHER LANGUAGE HAS EMERGED AND LANGUAGE HAS EVOLVED LET ME SITUATE MYSELF IN THIS CONVERSATION
IN WAYS THAT BINARY IDENTITIES SOMETIMES DON'T DO AS WELL THEY ARE CONSTANTLY
IDENTIFY AS
AGENDER THEY USE THE GENDER NEUTRAL PRONOUN THEY IT'S NOT A BINARY GENDER TERM
AND FOR THEM THEY SAY I DON'T HAVE A GENDER I AM GENDERLESS OR GENDER IS AT LEAST NOT VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE IT'S NOT A WAY THAT I THINK OF MYSELF PRIMARILY
SO THESE NON BINARY IDENTITIES ARE CHALLENGING OUR
TRANSGENDER COMMUNITIES TO REFER TO THEMSELVES IT WAS A WORD THAT TRANS FOLKS ADOPTED AND EVEN TO THE POINT OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST SOCIAL MOVEMENTS THAT WE KNOW OF FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE
ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH ONE
ANOTHER WE HAVE TRANS IDENTITIES THAT MYSELF AND OTHER FOLKS WHO WORK IN TRANSGENDER ACTIVISM ARE STARTING TO CALL BINARY IDENTIES
SO I CONSIDER MYSELF TO HAVE A RELATIVELY BINARY TRANS IDENTITY
OF 2014 TIME MAGAZINE SAID THAT OUR SOCIETY HAD REACHED THE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT
AND THAT WAS THE HEADLINE ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE THAT MONTH AND THEY PAIRED THAT WITH A PHOTO OF ACTRESS LAVERNE COX
AND YOU MAY KNOW LAVERNE COX'S NAME SHE IS THE ACTRESS WHO PLAYS
CIRCLES ALLY USED TO BE THIS IDENTITY TERM I'M AN ALLY
IS NOT USED BY AND LARGE REALLY AT ALL TODAY WITHIN THE MODERN TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY WE'LL GO BACK TO THE WORD TRANSEXUAL TRANSEXUAL AS A
ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO GENDER WE HAVE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT GENDER BASED ON THIS BINARY IDEA THAT THERE ARE ONLY MEN AND WOMEN AND THEY ARE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT
ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE TRIED TO LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE OR YOU GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARED DEFINITIONS AND SHARED MEANINGS OF
YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF GENDER IN THE WORLD
IS SILLY AND WE DON'T NEED IT WE CAN LIVE OUTSIDE OF THESE BOXES
SO WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL OF THIS INFORMATION
I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR YOU AND SOME ADVICE IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME
THE FIRST IS LISTEN
LISTEN TO TRANS FOLKS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES
LISTEN TO HOW WE SAY THE WORDS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US REFLECT THOSE WORDS BACK TO US
AND BE COMFORTABLE LEARNING NEW THINGS
LOTS IN THE LANDSCAPE OF TRANS IDENTITIES COULD BE RELATIVELY NEW
BE OK WITH THAT IT'S ALL RIGHT WE'LL ALL GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER
CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS CHALLENGE THOSE THINGS THAT NAG YOU IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY SO STOP THINKING ABOUT
AND FOR ME THAT FEELS GROSS IT FEELS KIND OF ICKY THOUGH I WOULD NEVER TELL ANOTHER PERSON ANOTHER TRANS PERSON SAY YOU CAN'T USE THAT WORD BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE
IF SOMEONE IDENTIFIES AS A TRANSSEXUAL
COOL NO BIG DEAL I DON'T IDENTIFY AS A TRANSSEXUAL I PREFER THE TERM TRANSGENDER MYSELF BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL ANOTHER PERSON WHAT WORDS THEY SHOULD USE TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES
BUT I WILL CAUTION YOU THAT THE TERM TRANSSEXUAL IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WORD THAT YOU SHOULD USE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT THAT PERSON IDENTIFIES AS A TRANSSEXUAL INSTEAD OF TRANSGENDER
SO
TRAININGS QUESTIONS QUICKLY EMERGE AND THOSE QUESTIONS TEND TO REVOLVE AROUND LANGUAGE AND WORDS
VAST THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF THEM BUT NOT ALL TRANS PEOPLE WANT OR NEED MEDICAL TRANSITION
SO SOME TRANS FOLKS SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY I NEED ACCESS TO THIS KIND OF CARE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH MY BODY TO ALIGN MY BODY WITH THE WAY THAT I THINK ALIGN IT WITH MY MIND
BUT AGAIN NOT ALL TRANS PEOPLE DO THIS SO THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO SAY I DON'T NEED THAT I FEEL OK WITH MY BODY I DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY MODIFY IT
WHY I LIKE THIS DEFINITION SO MUCH IS THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT I DIDN'T GET TO PICK WHERE I STARTED FROM
TRANSITIONED FROM FEMALE TO MALE
THERE ARE OTHER FOLKS WHO TRANSITIONED FROM MALE TO FEMALE
CELEBRITIES LIKE
JANET MOCK
CAITLYN JENNER AND LAVERNE COX WHO WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT ALSO THERE ARE TRANS MEN WHO ARE RELATIVELY FAMOUS LIKE CHAZ BONO
THE MEDIA TALKS ABOUT BINARY IDENTITIES AS IT RELATES TO TRANSGENDER PEOPLE
THIS IS LARGELY WHY WE DON'T OFTEN KNOW NON BINARY IDENTITY FOLKS
BECAUSE I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS THAT BINARY IDENTITIES REINFORCE OUR GENDER IDEAS THEY MAKE SENSE WE DON'T HAVE TO CHALLENGE A BUNCH OF STUFF TO TALK ABOUT BINARY IDENTITIES LIKE I HAVE
IT'S SOMETHING THAT FOLKS CAN WRAP THEIR MINDS AROUND
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF EDUCATION
BUT WHAT THE MEDIA LEAVES OUT ARE FOLKS WHO ESSENTIALLY GIVE A BIG MIDDLE FINGER TO THE BINARY
THEY SAY SCREW YOUR IDEAS ABOUT GENDER
THE IDEAS WE HAVE IN SOCIETY WE HAVE ABOUT GENDER ARE ESSENTIALLY
COIN FOR ME AT LEAST THE TERM TRANSSEXUAL HAS THE WORD SEX IN IT THAT KIND OF MAKES US THINK TRANS IS NOT REALLY A GENDER IDENTITY BUT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH SEXUALITY AND SEXUAL
PARTS OR WHAT THEIR NAME USED TO BE OR WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WITH THEM
TAKE PEOPLE AT THEIR FACE VALUE SOMEONE SAYS THAT THIS IS HOW THEY IDENTIFY
BE COOL WITH THAT
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BINARY IDENTITY IDEAS TRY TO CHALLENGE THOSE AND SAY
THOSE DON'T
SO THIS WORD WAS USED AS AN AFFIRMING TERM THOUGH CON TEMPORARILY THIS TERM IS LARGELY OFFENSIVE THE
TRANSITION OFTEN REFERS TO SOCIAL TRANSITIONS
AND MEDICAL TRANSITIONS
SO SOCIAL TRANSITION INVOLVES ESSENTIALLY THE COMING OUT PROCESS
DISCOVERING FOR YOURSELF WHAT ARE THE WORDS THAT FEEL COMFORTABLE FOR ME
HOW DO I THINK ABOUT MY GENDER AND THEN COMMUNICATING THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE BE IT SAYING YOU KNOW MY NAME IS JAY NOW I WANT YOU TO CALL ME THAT AND I WANT YOU TO USE MALE PRONOUNS WHEN YOU REFER TO ME
AND CLAIMING A TRANSGENDER IDENTITY WHATEVER THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE PERSON
AND A MEDICAL TRANSITION REFERS TO MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT YOU COULD DO TO YOUR BODY
MEDICAL
GENUINE TO ME IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT BUT I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO TALK ABOUT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY WORDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT
PLAYS A TRANS CHARACTER BUT IS ALSO TRANS HERSELF SHE IDENTIFIES IN THE SAME WAY AS HER CHARACTER SO SOPHIA IDENTIFIES AS A TRANSGENDER WOMAN AND LAVERNE COX HOLDS THAT SAME IDENTITY
NOW LOTS OF PEOPLE KNOW LAVERNE COX WHICH IS WHY I BRING HER UP OFTEN WHEN I DO TRAININGS ABOUT TRANSGENDER IDENTITY
AND I WANT TO POSE A SUGGESTION AS TO HOW WE CAN THINK ABOUT IT SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT TRANSGENDER
WE LOOK FOR EXPERIENCE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT I HIRE TWO CANDIDATES BOTH OF THEM FROM THE SAME SCHOOL SAME DEGREE SAME GRADE POINT AVERAGE
TWO YEARS AGO WE STARTED AN EXTRAORDINARY PROJECT
A WORK FORCE PILOT
THE GOAL WAS SIMPLE
HOW DO I PLACE TALENT WITH NO DEGREE NO EXPERIENCE SUCCESSFULLY TO JOBS
HOW WOULD I QUALIFY SUCH TALENT
AFTER SOME INDEPTH RESEARCH
AND EXPERIMENTATION
WE DECIDED TO USE COGNITIVE SKILLS ASSESSMENTS
COGNITIVE SKILLS IN PLAIN
EVEN HAPPY WORKING WITH THESE EMPLOYEES
SO WHAT DOES THAT LEAD ME
TO
I BELIEVE WE DO NOT HAVE
TO WRITE OFF AN ENTIRE GENERATION
I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO INCORPORATE COGNITIVE SKILLS ASSESSMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT IN SCHOOLS AND WORKFORCE ALIKE IN UNIVERSITIES AS WELL
I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU THIS YEAR
SIDE LISTENING AND OBSERVATION SKILLS ARE FOUND TO A VERY HIGH LEVEL IN CHILD CARE WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO A GUTSY MOVE THE COMPANY HIRED CHILD CARE WORKERS IN MAJOR METRO AREAS PAIRED THEM UP WITH THE ENGINEERS TAUGHT THEM THE
SIR KEN ROBINSON TALKS ABOUT THAT IN HIS TEDTALK FRANKLY WE'RE SHOOTING IN THE DARK AND WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RESULTS THAT WE NEED DO YOU REALIZE THAT 90
I THINK THE IDEAS ARE RIGHT AND WE NEED TO ACT NOW
THE PROCESS IS REALLY SIMPLE
FIRST
YOU IDENTIFY THE JOB YOU EVALUATE THE JOB TO THE COGNITIVE AREAS AND THE LEVELS NEEDED
SECOND YOU ASSESS THE TALENT AND YOU MAKE THE MATCH
AND THIRD WHICH I THINK IS THE BEST NEWS
IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN LEARN THESE SKILLS AND YOU CAN TEACH THESE SKILLS TO STUDENTS AND THE WORKFORCE
THIS OPENS UP A WHOLE NEW SET OF POSSIBILITIES FOR SCHOOLS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE
THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH NO DEGREES SCORED JUST AS HIGH AS INDIVIDUALS WITH DEGREES
WE ALSO FOUND THAT SCHOOLS DON'T TEACH COGNITIVE SKILLS SOMEHOW WE THINK IT'S INNATE WE LEARN THIS AT HOME
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE LENGTH OF EDUCATION JUST MARGINALLY IMPROVES YOUR COGNITIVE SKILLS OVER TIME
AS AN EMPLOYER THOSE COGNITIVE SKILLS ASSESSMENTS GIVE ME FIVE TIMES MORE ACCURATE RESULTS I CAN PREDICT FIVE
LATE
I HEARD A STUDENT SAY LAST YEAR
SCHOOLS TEACH ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW NOT HOW TO THINK
IS SHE RIGHT AS
AN EMPLOYER I AM A CUSTOMER OF THIS SYSTEM
AND LIKE YOU I'M STUCK
AND WHAT MAKES IT WORSE
I CONTRIBUTE TO ITS DISFUNCTION
YOU SEE
EVERYDAY WE SIFT THROUGH THOUSANDS OF RESUM S
INSTEAD OF A BACHELOR I'M GOING TO ASK FOR A MASTER AND INSTEAD OF TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE I'M GOING TO ASK FOR 15 YEARS EXPERIENCE I SHARE MY DILEMMA WITH UNIVERSITIES AND
THEIR BEST ENGINEERS IN TECHNICAL SALES SUPPORTS JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BOY WHAT A DISASTER THAT WAS
OUT THE JOB AND EVENTUALLY LEAVES WHY IS THAT SO I DECIDED TO
IS A NATURAL SYSTEM RIGHT BUT IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S VERY
EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIFE SO HOW DO WE DO THIS
FROM LIFE THAT WE FIND HERE ON EARTH AND THAT LEADS ME TO THE NEXT TERM WHICH
CERTAIN KIND OF MOLECULES LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE CLAY FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS
OF THOUSANDS OF MOLECULES WILL COME TOGETHER TO FORM A LARGE STRUCTURE THAT DIDN'T EXIST
CAN CONVERT RESOURCES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT INTO BUILDING BLOCKS SO IT CAN MAINTAIN AND BUILD
THAT ARE MISSING IS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD FLOW OF ENERGY THROUGH A SYSTEM WHAT WE'D WANT IS A PROTOCELL THAT CAN HARVEST SOME OF THAT ENERGY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITSELF MUCH LIKE LIVING SYSTEMS DO
INTO THE SYSTEM THAT LIFE CAN USE AND EXPLOIT TO MAINTAIN
BODY IT HAS A METABOLISM IT CAN USE ENERGY IT MOVES AROUND IT CAN SENSE ITS LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND ACTUALLY FIND RESOURCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO SUSTAIN ITSELF NOW THIS DOESN'T HAVE BRAIN IT DOESN'T HAVE A NEURAL SYSTEM THIS IS JUST A SACK OF
THIS PROTOCELL TO USE ENERGY TO DO SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY BECOME DYNAMIC AS WE'LL SEE
PERHAPS THESE PROTOCELLS HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL US ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON THE EARTH PERHAPS THESE REPRESENT AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE STEP ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS BY WHICH LIFE GOT STARTED ON THE EARLY EARTH CERTAINLY
ASSEMBLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS I CAN MIX SOME CHEMICALS TOGETHER IN A TEST TUBE IN MY LAB AND
FOR A MOMENT THIS QUOTE BY LEDUC A HUNDRED YEARS AGO CONSIDERING A KIND OF SYNTHETIC
CAN LOOK FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE OKAY ESPECIALLY IF THAT LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM LIFE ON EARTH
THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE CONSIDER TO BE NON LIVING SYSTEMS ON ONE
PROTOCELLS SATISFY THESE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF LIVING SYSTEMS SO BY MAKING THESE CHEMICAL ARTIFICIAL LIFE EXPERIMENTS WE HOPE NOT ONLY TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LIFE AND THE EXISTENCE OF LIFE ON THIS PLANET BUT ALSO
TO PRESERVE ITSELF WE TAKE THIS SAME MOVING PROTOCELL HERE AND WE PUT IT IN ANOTHER
EXPERIMENTS IN THE LABORATORY MIXING TOGETHER NONLIVING INGREDIENTS TO MAKE NEW STRUCTURES AND THAT THESE NEW STRUCTURES MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING SYSTEMS
TARRY STUFF IN YOUR PAN RIGHT THAT'S DIFFICULT TO WASH OUT SO THAT'S WHAT THE ORIGIN OF LIFE WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE YOU NEEDED TO GET LIFE OUT OF THIS
OF FIVE CHEMICALS HERE SIMPLE SYSTEM HERE WHEN THEY HYBRIDIZE YOU THEN FORM SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN
BLOCKS SO IT CAN MAINTAIN ITSELF NOW TODAY I TOLD YOU ABOUT VERY STRANGE AND WEIRD PROTOCELLS SOME THAT CONTAIN
PAN AND YOU APPLY ENERGY YOU TURN UP THE HEAT YOU START MAKING OR BREAKING CHEMICAL BONDS IN THE SUGAR FORMING A BROWNISH CARAMEL RIGHT
WILL START TO SELF ASSOCIATE TO FORM LARGER AND LARGER STRUCTURES SO SAY ON THE ORDER OF TENS OF THOUSANDS
ON OTHER LIVING SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO SAY REPRODUCE AND
CERTAIN KINDS OF STUDIES THE PLACEBO EFFECT JUST BECAUSE THE PERSON THINKS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM IS A PHARMACEUTICAL OR SOME SORT OF A FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY BELIEVE IT ENOUGH THERE
BY STUDYING THIS VERY EVEN THOUGH IT'S A VERY SIMPLE TRICK METHODOLOGICALLY
I CLOSE MY FINGER SAME THING AS I MOVE BACK THIS MOTION KIND OF COVERS THE MOVING BACK OF MY FINGER I TAKE THIS HAND AWAY YOU GIVE THE KNIFE OUT THERE IS A TRICK YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
INFORMATION IT DOESN'T COUNT ONE TWO THREE IT GROUPS THEM BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT RIGHT AND THEN I OPEN MY HAND UP OBVIOUSLY IT'S
{NS} AND THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK GO OK I DIDN'T REALLY SEE THAT PEOPLE IN THE SATELLITE ROOM ARE STARTING TO MOVE IN NOW LET ME GIVE YOU GOOD
NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE NO TRICKERY AND YOU CAN EXAMINE EVERYTHING TA DA {NS} SO THIS IS A TRICK THAT I OFTEN TEACH TO YOUNG
OUT THAT IF YOU ADMINISTER A PLACEBO IN THE FORM OF A WHITE PILL THAT'S LIKE ASPIRIN SHAPED IT'S JUST A ROUND WHITE PILL IT HAS SOME CERTAIN MEASURABLE EFFECT BUT IF YOU CHANGE THE FORM THAT YOU GIVE THE PLACEBO IN LIKE YOU MAKE A SMALLER PILL AND COLOR IT BLUE AND STAMP A LETTER INTO IT
IT IS
TO THE NEEDLE THIS IS A SEVEN INCH HATPIN IT'S VERY
TO SEE IF I COULD TAKE THAT IDEA AND APPLY IT TO A MAGIC TRICK AND TAKE SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A FAKE TRICK AND MAKE IT SEEM REAL
OUT THOUGH THAT THAT'S NOT EVEN WHERE IT STOPS IF YOU HAVE CAPSULES
THEY'RE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN TABLETS IN ANY FORM A COLORED CAPSULE THAT'S YELLOW ON ONE END AND RED ON THE OTHER IS BETTER THAN A WHITE CAPSULE
DOSAGE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS ONE PILL TWICE A DAY IS NOT AS GOOD AT THREE PILLS
I DON'T REMEMBER THE
I'M GOING TO PIERCE MY SKIN AND RUN THIS NEEDLE THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE
IF YOU FAINT EASILY
I
WAS DOING THIS FOR SOME FRIENDS IN THE HOTEL ROOM LAST NIGHT AND SOME PEOPLE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW AND ONE WOMAN ALMOST PASSED OUT SO I SUGGEST IF YOU GET QUEASY EASY THAT YOU LOOK AWAY FOR ABOUT THE NEXT 30 IN FACT YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO THE FIRST BAD PART BEHIND IT YOU'LL GET TO SEE YOU CAN LOOK AWAY TOO IF YOU'D LIKE TO
SO HERE
ONE SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A CHILDHOOD IS OUT THERE
MANY OF YOU IN THE ROOM KNOW THIS TRICK
WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS
I HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY HAND
I SAY I'M GOING TO
GRAB HOLD OF MY WRIST TO MAKE SURE NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE THAT IS LIE
THE REASON I'M HOLDING ONTO MY WRIST IS BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SECRET
OF THE ILLUSION IN MOMENT WHEN MY HAND MOVES FROM FACING YOU TO BEING AWAY FROM YOU THIS FINGER RIGHT HERE MY INDEX FINGER IS JUST GOING TO
IN THIS CONTEXT AND WITH THE IDEA OF TAKING SOMETHING FAKE AND MAKING IT INTO SOMETHING REAL I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE AND
IS BELIEVED IN ENOUGH BY SOMEBODY THAT IT BECOMES SOMETHING REAL IN OTHER WORDS SUGAR PILLS HAVE A MEASURABLE
AND THE FORM HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU WANT THE ULTIMATE IN PLACEBO
YOU'VE GO TO THE NEEDLE
RIGHT A SYRINGE WITH SOME INERT A COUPLE CCS OF SOME INERT SOMETHING AND YOU INJECT THIS INTO A PATIENT WELL THIS IS SUCH A POWERFUL IMAGE IN THEIR MIND IT'S SO MUCH STRONGER THAN THE WHITE PILL IT'S A REALLY THIS GRAPH WELL I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME WHEN WE HAVE SLIDES THE POINT IS
I'M GOING TO OPEN MY HAND AND HOPEFULLY
TO STAB HIMSELF THROUGH THE SKIN TO ENTERTAIN US FOR A FEW MINUTES SO LET ME GIVE YOU LITTLE PEEK
REALLY MY FLESH THIS IS NOT DAMIAN'S SPECIAL GROWN FLESH THAT'S MY
TRICK
SORT OF
BUT YOU CAN'T COUNT MY FINGERS RIGHT NOW CAN YOU SO LET ME SHOW THEM TO YOU THAT'S
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE YES WELL
IT GOES LIKE THIS FROM HERE RIGHT AND AS I MOVE AROUND MY FINGER SHIFTS AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS DECEPTIVE WHY YOU DON'T NOTICE THERE ARE ONLY THREE FINGERS DOWN HERE BECAUSE THE MIND AND THE WAY
IT WORKS THIS IS A TRICK THAT'S BEEN IN EVERY CHILDREN'S MAGIC BOOK SINCE AT LEAST THE 1950S
I LEARNED IT MYSELF FROM CUB SCOUT MAGIC IN THE 1970S
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN IT AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN WHY I EXPLAINED
IT
SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS THE KNIFE WHICH YOU CAN EXAMINE MY HAND WHICH YOU COULD EXAMINE I'M JUST GOING TO HOLD THE KNIFE IN MY FIST LIKE THIS I'LL GET MY SLEEVE BACK
AND TO MAKE SURE NOTHING GOES UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE I'M JUST GOING TO SQUEEZE MY WRIST RIGHT HERE THAT WAY YOU CAN SEE THAT AT NO TIME CAN ANYTHING TRAVEL AS LONG AS I'M SQUEEZING THERE NOTHING CAN GO UP OR DOWN MY SLEEVE
MORE WILL CHANGE AROUND THE WAY WE DO OUR WORK THAN HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST
AND THE COMPUTER SHOWS ME A CAR AND I SAY NO MORE FAST LOOKING AND LESS GERMAN AND BANG THE COMPUTER SHOWS ME AN OPTION
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WORLD WITH MORE VARIETY MORE CONNECTEDNESS MORE DYNAMISM MORE COMPLEXITY MORE ADAPTABILITY
WORKING FROM PREDEFINED RECIPES WATSON HAD TO USE REASONING
INTERESTINGLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET AIS TO DO FOR THE LAST 60 OR SO
AGE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE AUGMENTED COGNITIVELY PHYSICALLY AND PERCEPTUALLY WHAT
I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT WE'RE ALREADY
PROGRAMMERS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ALPHAGO WAS DOING WHAT IT WAS DOING AND THINGS ARE MOVING REALLY FAST I MEAN CONSIDER IN THE SPACE OF A HUMAN
THE BUILDING BARBIE THEY COULD'VE USED THAT KNOWLEDGE TO CREATE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WAS BETTER FOR THE
WILL START 3D PRINTING IN STAINLESS STEEL AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP PRINTING WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION UNTIL THE BRIDGE IS
VERY SOON YOU'LL LITERALLY BE ABLE TO SHOW SOMETHING YOU'VE MADE YOU'VE DESIGNED TO A COMPUTER
PEOPLE TO BUY THE THINGS WE'VE MADE BUT IF YOU HAD THIS CONNECTION TO THE THINGS THAT YOU DESIGN AND CREATE AFTER THEY'RE OUT IN THE REAL WORLD AFTER THEY'VE BEEN SOLD OR LAUNCHED OR WHATEVER
ALL IT NEEDS ARE YOUR GOALS AND YOUR CONSTRAINTS I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
THAT CONVERSATION MIGHT BE A LITTLE WAYS OFF PROBABLY LESS THAN MANY OF US
THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME WILL BE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE WHY BECAUSE WHAT WILL BE SHAPING THOSE THINGS IS THIS NEW PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY
ENTREPRENEURS ARTISTS OR MAYBE YOU JUST HAVE A REALLY BIG IMAGINATION
MAKING ALL OF THIS CRAZY NEW STUFF THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVENT AND DESIGN I THINK THE ERA OF HUMAN AUGMENTATION IS AS MUCH ABOUT THE PHYSICAL WORLD AS IT IS ABOUT THE VIRTUAL INTELLECTUAL
HUMAN CAPABILITIES ARE GOING TO BE AUGMENTED BY COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS THAT HELP YOU THINK ROBOTIC SYSTEMS THAT HELP YOU
INTO A GENERATIVE DESIGN AI WE CALL DREAMCATCHER SO WHAT DO GET WHEN YOU GIVE A DESIGN TOOL A NERVOUS SYSTEM AND YOU ASK IT TO BUILD YOU THE ULTIMATE CAR
IS A NERVOUS SYSTEM CONNECTING US TO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE DESIGN MAKE AND
ON DIGITAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS THAT CONNECT US TO THE THINGS WE
PICKS UP THAT LEASH MAGGIE KNOWS WITH A FAIR DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IT'S TIME TO GO FOR WALK AND HOW DID SHE LEARN
WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF OUR NEXT GREAT ERA AS A SPECIES
PHOTOS AND ARTICLES ABOUT THESE SIBLING PAIRS READING ABOUT THEIR LIVES I'VE BEEN FASCINATED ABOUT HOW THE MEDIA PORTRAYS THEM AS FEATS OF HUMANITY MARVELS OF SCIENCE ALL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT RACIAL APPEARANCE
BUT WHAT'S EVEN MORE FASCINATING THAN THESE PHOTOS THEMSELVES HAS BEEN THE PUBLIC REACTION TO
THEM SOME PEOPLE VIEW THESE PICTURES AS EVIDENCE THAT RACISM
ALL BE IMPACTED BY RACISM
THE QUESTION THAT DRIVES MY WORK IS WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT BE TRUE THAT WHAT LOVE LOOKS LIKE IN FAMILIES CAN DEPEND ON WHAT YOU LOOK
LIKE THE BASIC PREMISE OF THIS
TALK REALLY CHALLENGES WHAT MANY OF US FUNDAMENTALLY
HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS DARK SKINNED BUT SHE VIEWED HER DARK SKIN AS BEING EVIDENCE THAT HER DAUGHTER POSSESSED TRUE BLACK BEAUTY OTHER FAMILIES DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE ANTI RACIST PERSONAS
WE KNOW THAT RACIAL APPEARANCE MATTERS IN SOCIETY
BUT MIGHT IT ALSO MATTER IN PEOPLE'S FAMILIES HOW MIGHT RACIAL APPEARANCE IMPACT HOW PEOPLE ARE TREATED WITHIN THEIR OWN HOMES AND WITH THEIR OWN FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
NOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING OKAY THIS SOUNDS LIKE AN EXCITING PROJECT
AND BRAZIL WAS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL LOCATION FOR THIS PROJECT THAT WAS A NO BRAINER
FOR ME BUT THERE WERE SOME BARRIERS IN MY RESEARCH FIRST I HAD TO LEARN PORTUGUESE
AFTER OVERCOMING THAT BARRIER I HAD TO DEAL WITH MY OWN SKEPTICISM ABOUT WHETHER I WOULD BE ABLE TO OBSERVE SOME OF THE DYNAMICS ABOUT WHICH I'M TALKING SO
IN ONE OF MY EARLIEST TRIPS TO BRAZIL
I MET A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF ANA
ANA WAS A LOCAL STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY WHEN I TOLD HER THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN STUDYING RACE LOVE AND FAMILY
SHE HAD THE FOLLOWING RESPONSE
THAT RACIAL MIXTURE IN BRAZIL IS VERY HIGH
RACISM ALSO STILL EXISTS WHITENESS IS STILL OVERVALUED AND A PERSON'S LIFE CHANCES AND LIFE OPPORTUNITIES ARE STILL SHAPED BY THEIR PHYSICAL PROXIMITY TO WHITENESS SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
A PERSON'S SKIN COLOR HAIR
AS A BIG SISTER WHAT THIS SUGGESTED TO ME IS THAT HONEST PORTRAYAL OF FAMILIES WAS A PARTIAL ONE THAT THERE WERE NUMBERS OF WAYS THAT FAMILIES COULD BOTH
INTERESTED IN HOW RACE CAN INFILTRATE FAMILIES
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART HOW RACE CAN LEAD TO UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF LOVE AND AFFECTION IN THE SAME FAMILY
SO HOW PARENTS
WELL
AND THE DARK ONE IS FORGOTTEN
THE BLACK ONE IS PUNISHED BECAUSE IT IS SAID TO HAVE A CARA DUM ESCRAVO
THE FACE OF A SLAVE
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS WAS A POWERFUL STATEMENT TO BE MADE
BUT IT ALSO MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH I WASN'T SO FAR IN LEFT FIELD WITH THIS INTEREST THAT I HAD IN CAPTURING RACE LOVE AND EMOTION IN FAMILIES
IN MY
BOOK THE COLOR OF LOVE
I SPEND OVER 16 MONTHS WORKING WITH
EFFORT TO ERADICATE RACISM HAS TO LEVERAGE THE POWER AND THE INFLUENCE OF FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES
BUT NOT JUST THAT
IT MUST ALSO PROMOTE CONCRETE PUBLIC POLICIES
CONCRETE LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT LEAD TO STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN OUR
ONE LOOK AT THE BABY'S BLACK EARS AND DECIDED THAT HER PARTNER WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THIS CHILD
THEIR ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THIS CHILD WOULD EVENTUALLY GROW UP TO BE DARK SKINNED
SO FOR THAT REASON THEY FIGURED IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE SON TO HAVE FATHERED A
RACE LOVE AND FAMILY FUNCTION TOGETHER
SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT RESONATED WITH WHAT ANA HAD SAID TO ME ABOUT THE FACE OF SLAVE
SO FIRST I MET A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF DO A ELENA
DO A ELENA IN HER INTERVIEW REVEALS TO ME THAT WHEN SHE DELIVERED A
STRAIGHT HAIR I'M AFRAID THEY WILL LOVE HER MORE HER HAIR WON'T GIVE THEM AS MUCH TROUBLE EVERYONE IS SAYING IT SHE'LL HAVE EVERYTHING AND I'LL HAVE NOTHING HEGANY
WE KNOW THAT HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS BUT HOME MIGHT ALSO BE WHERE THE HURT IS
SOCIETY THAT LEADS TO THE ERADICATION OF RACISM IN THE UNITED STATES BRAZIL AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
LIKE HOME I GUESS DOROTHY SAID IT BEST
HOME SWEET HOME ALL OF THESE PHRASES REALLY RESONATE WITH THE IMPORTANCE THAT WE GIVE TO FAMILIES
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TODAY AND CHALLENGING YOU TO DO IS THINK ABOUT HOW FAMILIES ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND CONTRADICTORY THAN WE EVER GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR BEING
AS IT RELATES TO RACE IN PARTICULAR
FAMILIES CAN CERTAINLY PROTECT FAMILY MEMBERS AGAINST RACISM
BUT THEY MIGHT
BLACK PANTHER HE NAMES HIMSELF AFTER THE BLACK PANTHERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS A RADICAL POLITICAL AGENDA THAT INVOLVES RAISING THE RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF PEOPLE IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD
HE INTRODUCES ME TO HIS WIFE WHO HE CALLS THE PANTERONA THE BIG PANTHER WHO ALSO IS COMMITTED TO THE SAME THING TO RAISING RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS
ALL THE DIFFERENCES THAT BIOLOGICAL SIBLINGS MIGHT HAVE
WE DON'T THINK OF RACIAL DIFFERENCE AS BEING ON THE TOP OF THAT LIST
BUT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF INTEREST EVEN A MEDIA FRENZY OVER COUPLES AND FAMILIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO'VE HAD CHILDREN
OF DIFFERENT
FREDERICK DOUGLAS SAYS POWER CONCEDES NOTHING WITHOUT A DEMAND I ENCOURAGE EACH OF YOU TO USE YOUR
WAS WHERE DID YOU GET THAT BLACK BABY LEV LA DE VOLTA TAKE HER BACK CORINA HAD A SIMILAR STORY SHE TOLD ME ABOUT WHEN SHE
AND EVEN IN HAIR TEXTURE
BUT THESE SUPERFICIAL DIFFERENCES DON'T JUSTIFY THE CREATION OF RACIAL CATEGORIES
THERE'S NO BIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR THIS THING THAT WE CALL RACE
BUT EVEN AS I SAY THIS AS A SOCIOLOGIST I KNOW THAT RACE AND RACISM MATTER THEY MATTER IN OUR SOCIETY
WHEN I SAY RACISM WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF
SHE'S CONSTANTLY ALMOST OBSESSIVELY OBSERVING THE BABY WAITING TO SEE CHANGES IN THE BABY'S SKIN COLOR WAITING FOR IT TO BECOME DARKER FOR THE BABY'S HAIR TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT CURLIER BUT SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS I
I ASK HEGANY WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE A BIG SISTER WHAT IS THIS LIKE
HER RESPONSE TO ME WAS THE FOLLOWING
EU TENHO MEDO DE PERDER O CARINHO DOS MEUS PAIS I'M
AFRAID OF LOSING THE LOVE OF MY PARENTS
SO I ASKED HEGANY WHY DO YOU
CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL MOVEMENTS NOW LIKE BLACK LIVES MATTER ARE ALSO EXCEPTIONALLY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE RELEVANT BOTH IN THE LOCAL CONTEXTS
BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE RELEVANT IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT
THE BEST PART ABOUT THEIR MESSAGE
IS THAT IT'S RELEVANT FOR WHITE
DEVASTATING ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW IS THAT SHE'S ONLY NINE YEARS OLD YET EVEN AT THIS AGE SHE UNDERSTANDS HOW RACIAL FEATURES CAN IMPACT THE WAY THAT HER FAMILY INTERACTS WITH HER THE LEVEL OF LOVE AND AFFECTION THAT SHE MIGHT RECEIVE IN THE FAMILY
OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKS AND MONTHS THAT I'M IN THIS FAMILY I OBSERVE HEGANY
LOVE AND EMOTIONS
I WAS INEVITABLY DRAWN TO AN INCREDIBLE COUNTRY AND THAT WAS BRAZIL
WHAT MOST OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT BRAZIL IS THAT THE MIX BETWEEN AFRICAN INDIGENOUS AND PORTUGUESE POPULATIONS HAS GIVEN RISE TO SOME OF THE MOST RACIALLY DIVERSE FAMILIES IN THE WORLD
IN BRAZIL HAVING A BABY IS A
MIGHT LEAD US TO THE END OF RACISM NOW AS A SOCIOLOGIST I DISAGREE WITH BOTH OF THOSE IDEAS BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT LESSONS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THESE PHOTOS NUMBER

OUR REALITY FACE THE FACTS AND REALISE THAT THE WAY WE'RE LIVING RIGHT NOW IS NOT GOING TO LAST FOR THE NEXT 1000 YEARS OR SO THE CHANGE HAS TO BE MADE ONE BY ONE

UP BESIDE ME AND SAID SO HAVE YOU EVER BEEN COW TIPPING I WAS LIKE COW TIPPING HE WAS LIKE YEAH COWS SLEEP STANDING UP SO IF YOU APPROACH THEM FROM BEHIND DOWN WIND YOU CAN PUSH THEM OVER AND THEY GO THUD IN THE
IN AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE WARD AT THE HOSPITAL AND ANYBODY WHO CAME TO SEE ME HAD TO COVER THEMSELVES IN MASK AND COVER ALL OF THE EXTRANEOUS PARTS OF THEIR BODY
AND ONE NIGHT I GOT CALL FROM MY MOTHER IN LAW THAT MY DAUGHTERS AT THAT TIME THREE AND HALF WERE MISSING ME AND FEELING MY
SORT OF A DAD FOR EVERY SIDE WE KIND OF WENT THROUGH MY PERSONALITY AND TRIED TO GET A DAD WHO REPRESENTED EACH DIFFERENT THING SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS I WROTE LETTER TO EACH OF THESE MEN
AND THEN I ASKED HIM A QUESTION WHICH I ENDED UP ASKING TO ALL THE DADS AND ENDED UP REALLY ENCOURAGING ME TO WRITE THIS STORY DOWN IN A BOOK AND THAT WAS WHAT'S THE ONE PIECE OF ADVICE YOU WOULD GIVE TO MY GIRLS AND JEFF'S ADVICE
I STOPPED WALKING AND IT TOOK MY MIND SECOND TO CONVERT THAT DOUBLE NEGATIVE INTO A MUCH MORE HORRIFYING NEGATIVE
I HAVE CANCER
AND TO THINK THAT THE TUMOR WAS IN THE SAME BONE IN THE SAME PLACE IN MY BODY AS THE ACCIDENT 38 YEARS EARLIER IT SEEMED LIKE TOO MUCH OF A
I FOUND IS A PASSPORT TO INTIMACY IT IS AN INVITATION MAYBE EVEN A MANDATE TO ENTER THE MOST VITAL ARENAS OF HUMAN LIFE THE MOST SENSITIVE AND THE MOST FRIGHTENING THE ONES THAT WE NEVER
MY HOME IS NOT FAR FROM THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AND DURING THE YEAR AND A HALF I WAS ON CRUTCHES IT BECAME A SORT OF SYMBOL TO ME SO ONE DAY NEAR THE END OF MY JOURNEY I SAID COME ON GIRLS LET'S TAKE WALK ACROSS THE BROOKLYN
MIGHT BE WRONG WITH MY BONES AND MY DOCTOR ON A WHIM SENT ME TO GET A FULL BODY BONE SCAN WHICH SHOWED THAT THERE WAS SOME GROWTH IN MY LEFT LEG THAT SENT ME TO AN X RAY THEN TO AN MRI AND
PAUSING MAY BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST LESSON I TOOK FROM MY JOURNEY THERE'S A QUOTE
AND MY REWARD FOR SURVIVING IT WAS TO GO BACK FOR FOUR MORE MONTHS OF CHEMO IT WAS AS WE SAID IN MY HOUSE A LOST YEAR
IS MY LITERARY AGENT HE'S ABOUT FIVE FOOT THREE AND A HALF ON A GOOD DAY STANDING FULLY UPRIGHT IN COWBOY BOOTS
AND ON KIND OF THE MANLY MALE FRONT HE ANSWERS THE PHONE I CAN SAY THIS I GUESS BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE IT HERE HE ANSWERS THE PHONE YO MOTHERFUCKER
HE GIVES BORING SPEECHES ABOUT OBSCURE BOTTLES OF WINE AND ON HIS 50TH BIRTHDAY HE BOUGHT A CONVERTIBLE SPORTS
THIS WAS THE 1960S WHEN ACTUALLY ALL THE STREETS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WERE NAMED AFTER CONFEDERATE WAR GENERALS WE LIVED ON ROBERT E LEE
AND I DID THIS IN AN ATTEMPT TO HELP OUR DAUGHTERS BUT IT REALLY CHANGED US SO I STAND HERE TODAY AS YOU SEE NOW WALKING WITHOUT CRUTCHES OR A CANE AND LAST WEEK I HAD MY 18 MONTH
I'VE EVER BEEN
AND WHAT WAS SO STRIKING ABOUT THAT TIME WAS INSTEAD OF REPULSING PEOPLE
I WAS ACTUALLY PROVING TO BE A MAGNET FOR PEOPLE PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLY DRAWN
WHEN MY WIFE AND I HAD KIDS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ALL HANDS ON DECK INSTEAD IT WAS EVERYBODY RUNNING THE OTHER WAY
AND WHEN I HAD CANCER WE THOUGHT
THAT COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT AND YET IT'S ONE THING WE DON'T ACTUALLY BRING IN AND THERE WAS SOMETHING INCREDIBLY PROFOUND ABOUT SITTING DOWN WITH MY CLOSEST FRIENDS AND
STARTED REJECTING MY NOMINEES SHE WAS LIKE WELL I LOVE HIM
ON THE SIDE OF THE LIBERTY BELL AND IT COMES FROM A PASSAGE IN THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS THAT EVERY SEVEN YEARS YOU SHOULD LET THE LAND LAY FALLOW
I PLANTED THE SEEDS FOR A HEALTHIER FUTURE AND WAS REUNITED WITH THE ONES I LOVE COME THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF MY JOURNEY I WENT TO SEE MY SURGEON DR JOHN HEALEY AND BY THE WAY HEALEY GREAT NAME FOR A
LOVE FOR YOU IN MY BODY DADDY I CAN'T STOP GIVING YOU HUGS AND KISSES AND WHEN I HAVE NO MORE LOVE LEFT I JUST DRINK MILK BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE LOVE COMES
THE HANDLE UNDERNEATH MY HAND I DIDN'T NEED THE CRUTCH ANYMORE I WAS WALKING ON AIR AND ONE OF THE PROFOUND THINGS THAT
{LG} I'M BRUCE I SAID AND PROMPTLY PASSED OUT I BROKE MY LEFT FEMUR THAT DAY IT'S THE LARGEST BONE IN YOUR BODY AND SPENT THE NEXT TWO MONTHS IN A BODY CAST THAT WENT FROM MY
HUNDRED AMERICANS A YEAR GET AN OSTEOSARCOMA EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT ARE UNDER 21 ONLY A HUNDRED ADULTS YEAR GET ONE OF THESE DISEASES TWENTY YEARS AGO DOCTORS WOULD HAVE CUT OFF MY LEG AND HOPED AND THERE WAS 15 PERCENT SURVIVAL
SO A FEW WEEKS AFTER MY DIAGNOSIS WE WENT UP TO VERMONT AND I DECIDED TO PUT JEFF AS THE FIRST PERSON IN THE COUNCIL OF DADS AND WE WENT TO THIS APPLE ORCHARD AND I READ HIM THIS LETTER WILL YOU HELP BE THEIR
TO HAVE SETBACKS AND THEN ASPIRATIONS AND I SAID WHAT'S THE MOST VALUABLE THING YOU CAN GIVE TO A DREAMER AND HE SAID A BELIEF IN THEMSELVES BUT WHEN I CAME TO SEE YOU I SAID I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MYSELF I WAS AT A WALL HE SAID I DON'T SEE THE WALL AND I'M TELLING YOU THE SAME
GO TO BUT WHEN WE DO GO THERE WE FEEL INCREDIBLY TRANSFORMED WHEN WE
AND THAT IS EVERYBODY DIES BUT NOT EVERYBODY LIVES I WANT YOU TO LIVE
OF THIS TODAY BECAUSE THE THOUGHT THAT CAME TO MY MIND WAS THAT THE FEELING THAT I HAD WAS LIKE PRIMAL SCREAM AND WHAT WAS SO STRIKING AND ONE OF THE MESSAGES I WANT TO LEAVE YOU HERE WITH TODAY
IN AND THRASH AROUND AND SEE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE
AND AS HE TALKED HE HAD THAT GLINT IN HIS EYE THAT I FIRST SAW BACK IN HOLLAND THE GLINT THAT SAYS LET'S GO COW TIPPING EVEN THOUGH
WE NEVER DID TIP THE COW
EVEN THOUGH NO ONE TIPS THE COW
EVEN THOUGH COWS DON'T SLEEP STANDING UP
HE
AT 614 AND 646 ON APRIL 15 2005 OUR OTHERWISE GRIM HUMORLESS DOCTOR LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND WAS LIKE HMM APRIL 15TH TAX DAY EARLY FILER AND LATE FILER
I WAS HIT BY A PASSING SEDAN MY MANGLED BODY FLEW IN ONE DIRECTION MY MANGLED BIKE FLEW IN THE OTHER AND I LAY ON THE PAVEMENT STRETCHING OVER THAT YELLOW LINE AND ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS CAME RUNNING
THIS ACT OF ACTUALLY CONNECTING TO ALL THESE PEOPLE AND IT MADE ME THINK AND I'LL JUST NOTE FOR THE RECORD ONE WORD THAT I'VE ONLY HEARD ONCE ACTUALLY WAS WHEN WE
STRIKE A MATCH HOLD MY BREATH IT'S PERMANENT NO TURNING BACK STRIKE A
FIX WHAT'S ALREADY WRITTEN TRY TO UNDO THE INK BUT IT'S STILL GONNA LEAVE A STAIN BUT
LOOK AT ME WITH THOSE SAD EYES BECAUSE
UM AND I'M REALLY HAPPY YOU GUYS ARE HERE TODAY TO HEAR MY SONGS AND FOR ME TO SHARE MY STORIES THIS SONG I WROTE IS CALLED BURN I HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY IT
DECISIONS THAT REALLY GO TO THE BEST INTEREST OF YOURSELF WE JUST HAD A BREAK JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO AND THERE WERE TWO
IN SOME COUNTRIES THE GREEN COUNTRIES YOU ARE NOT A DONOR UNLESS YOU OPT IN YOU CHOOSE TO BECOME ONE YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO BECOME AN ORGAN DONOR IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU BUT IN THE BLUE COUNTRIES YOU ARE
YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BISCUIT YOU CAN DO IT AND MANY OF YOU DID I KNOW IT
DID YOU EVER WONDER WHY IN IKEA YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW A SET PATH YOU CAN FOLLOW IT YOU CAN ALWAYS OPT OUT RIGHT BUT IF YOU DO YOU'RE GOING TO
CHARITIES MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE GETTING VERY INTERESTED IN SUCH AN APPROACH WHY THE APPEAL IS CLEAR MOST OF THESE APPLICATIONS ARE CHEAP IT DOESN'T COST MUCH TO IMPLEMENT THEM BUT OF COURSE THE BEST
CONTEXT MATTERS REMEMBER THAT CONTEXT MATTERS WHAT ABOUT THIS GRAPH
DISPLAY THAT KIDS CAN REACH IN ORDER TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS BUT OF COURSE KIDS THEMSELVES ARE NOT CONSUMERS BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT
CLEAR BY NOW WE ARE BECOMING AWARE OF THIS AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NO NEUTRAL DESIGN EXISTS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
THEY CAN NO LONGER DO IT YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE ONE CHECKING THE BOX IF YOU REALLY NEED THE SERVICE ANOTHER EXAMPLE
TO HEAR THEY'RE USING OUR COGNITIVE AND MENTAL SHORTCUTS THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME WHAT'S THE GOAL TO MAKE US CLICK THAT'S WHAT GENERATES REVENUE AND
TO KEEP YOU FIT HE COULD TRY TO STEER YOU TOWARDS THE STAIRS INSTEAD OF TOWARDS
THAT SOCIAL CONTEXT MATTERS TOO ALL WHAT I'M TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE TO YOU TODAY SHOWS THAT IN REALITY WE RELY EVERY SINGLE DAY
TALK ABOUT THOSE PRACTICES THE MORE WE LEARN HOW TO SPOT THEM
THEY APPEAR BEHIND EVERY CORNER
BUT WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM AND POSSIBLY TRY TO ACT
UPON IT
AND BY DOING SO
I
LIKE TO CHOOSE WE TEND TO STICK TO A PREDETERMINED POSITION AND THAT MEANS THAT DEFAULT MATTERS
YOUR INTEREST PROBABLY YOU ARE AND WHAT ABOUT ETHICAL ISSUES DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE INFORMED WHEN SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO TRICK YOU PERHAPS YOU DO AND THERE'S ALSO A FURTHER FLAW
LIFE IS ABOUT CHOICE
WHAT TO EAT WHAT TO READ WHOM
TO VOTE FOR
BUT ALSO WHAT TO BUY
AND SOMETIMES WHERE TO LIVE
WE CANNOT ALWAYS CHOOSE IN
PRINT OR YOUR KIDS ARE TARGETED BY ADVERTISERS WELL YOU WOULD BE UNDER THEIR TRAP
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS SHOULD WE BE SCARED I DON'T
THINK SO
THE MORE
WE ARE EXPOSED
TO THESE PRACTICES THE
ABOUT TO BUY A FLIGHT TICKET ONLINE AND THE AIRLINE USED TO OFFER YOU A LOT OF EXTRA SERVICES LIKE
I'M TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE TODAY COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES PSYCHOLOGY
BUT ALSO BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS AND SOME ASPECTS FROM NEUROSCIENCES AND WHAT ALL THESE DISCIPLINES ARE SUGGESTING US IS THAT WE ARE NOT
USING FOOTPRINTS WHICH ARE ON THE FLOOR TO LEAD YOU TO GO TOWARDS THE TRASH BIN BECAUSE THESE WILL REDUCE THE COST FOR SOCIETY TO COLLECT WASTE AND WHAT
TO APPEAR ON THE TOP OF THE LIST WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ASKING GOOGLE TODAY IS TO
SOMEHOW HELP US
BY SHOWING ALTERNATIVE SEARCH ENGINES THAT WILL ENABLE US TO FIND EXACTLY THAT LITTLE CAF IN PARIS
IT IS PRETTY
OUR LIFE COULD TRULY BE THE SUM OF OUR
THIS IS BECOMING EVEN MORE INTERESTING TODAY AND PERHAPS MORE
LETTERS LIKE THIS ONE DEAR MISS FASTDRIVER WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU TO PAY YOUR FINE FOR EXCESS SPEED MOST OF YOUR FELLOWS
BECAUSE THIS IS DISRUPTIVE IT IS POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE FOR OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OWN BEING BUT ALSO FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIETY
THIS IS DISRUPTIVE AND
AS IT IS OFTEN THE CASE
WHEN IT COMES TO NEW DISCOVERIES THESE NEW DISCOVERIES CAN BE USED FOR GOOD OR FOR
TO TAKE FREE DECISIONS DECISIONS THAT GO TO YOUR BEST INTEREST IN YOUR LIFE IF NOT I HAVE ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION FOR YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE VALUE OF THE SIMPLE ACT OF COOKING
ONE BOY WENT GROCERY SHOPPING WITH HIS MOM AND HE ASKED HER TO BUY
WHO COOK FOR OUR CHILDREN IN SCHOOL CAFETERIAS EVERYDAY AS WE DO HIGH
REALLY THINK ABOUT IT EVERYONE LOVES TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE VALUED HONOURED RESPECTED AND
YEAR THE HEART OF COOKING WITH KIDS IS DIRECT HANDS ON EXPERIENCE WITH FRESH AFFORDABLE FOODS FROM DIVERSE CULTURAL TRADITIONS
SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE
WHETHER IT IS MINESTRONE AS YOU SEE HERE OR PAELLA
LENTILS
RED CHILLY OR GRILLED CHEESE AND TOMATO SANDWICH ENJOY THAT DELICIOUS PLEASURE AND HOW IT IS NEW EVERY
NOW THIS BOY COMES TO SCHOOL WITH PEARS AND PEAS IN HIS LUNCH WHERE BEFORE IT WAS FILLED WITH COOKIES AND CHIPS
SHE LOOKED HIM AND SAID YOU DO NOT LIKE PEAS {LG} AND HE PROMPTLY TOOK A SNOW PEA AND ATE IT
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT COOKING CAN BE VIEWED AS EITHER ENSLAVEMENT OR FREEDOM IN THESE TIMES OF
FROM THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE COOKING AS PART OF THEIR LIVES
I ALSO OBSERVED THAT
A LOT OF THESE CHILDREN HAD A LIMITED PALLET THAT IS THEY LIKE TO EAT VERY FEW FOODS
AND SO WITH SUPPORT FROM NUTRITION PROFESSIONALS AND CHEFS IN OUR COMMUNITY COOKING WITH KIDS
THIS CHILD SAID I AM GOING TO EAT THE CARROTS BECAUSE I CUT THEM {LG} SO SIMPLE
BACKYARD I BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT MANY OF MY CHILDREN'S FRIENDS HAD NO IDEA WHERE THEIR FOOD
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY EFFECTIVE THERAPY OR VACCINE AVAILABLE AND SO
WELL PARTIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT OR THOUGHT TO BE DIFFICULT TO WEAPONIZE THE VIRUS BUT MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL RISK IN DEVELOPING IT AND THIS IS REALLY THE POINT
TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT
EPIDEMICS LIKE EBOLA WE NEED TO TAKE ON THE RISK OF INVESTING IN VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND IN STOCKPILE CREATION
AND WE NEED TO VIEW THIS THEN AS THE ULTIMATE DETERRENT SOMETHING WE MAKE SURE IS AVAILABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME PRAYING WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND THEY'RE GOING TO THREATEN THE WORLD AND VACCINES ARE OUR BEST DEFENSE
REASON WE HAVE TWO VACCINES IN LATE STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS NOW IS
TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES OR SOME TYPE OF SUBSIDY WE ALSO
REALITY IS WE DEVELOP VACCINES NOT BASED UPON THE RISK THE PATHOGEN POSES TO PEOPLE
BUT ON HOW ECONOMICALLY RISKY IT IS TO DEVELOP THESE VACCINES
VACCINE DEVELOPMENT IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED IT CAN COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO TAKE EVEN A WELL KNOWN ANTIGEN AND TURN IT INTO A VIABLE
SYMPTOMS BEGIN WITH MILD FEVER HEADACHE MUSCLE PAINS FOLLOWED BY VOMITING AND DIARRHEA THEN BLEEDING FROM THE MOUTH NOSE AND GUMS DEATH FOLLOWS IN THE FORM
OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY IT IN THE 24 OUTBREAKS THAT HAVE OCCURRED
AND IN FACT WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD VACCINE CANDIDATES AVAILABLE NOW FOR MORE THAN A DECADE
WHY IS THAT THOSE VACCINES ARE JUST GOING INTO CLINICAL TRIALS NOW
THIS GOES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH VACCINE DEVELOPMENT FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES
CHANGE THE WAY WE VIEW AND PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES
WE HAVE TO STOP WAITING UNTIL WE SEE EVIDENCE OF A DISEASE BECOMING A GLOBAL THREAT
BEFORE WE CONSIDER IT AS ONE
SO FOR EBOLA
THE PARANOID FEAR OF AN
THE CLUE
WE MAY HAVE IT SOMEDAY
SO
WE RIGHTFULLY FEAR EBOLA BECAUSE IT DOESN'T KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS OTHER DISEASES IN FACT IT'S MUCH LESS TRANSMISSIBLE THAN VIRUSES SUCH AS FLU OR MEASLES WE FEAR EBOLA BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT KILLS US AND WE CAN'T TREAT IT WE FEAR THE CERTAIN INEVITABILITY THAT COMES WITH EBOLA EBOLA HAS THIS INEVITABILITY THAT SEEMS TO DEFY MODERN MEDICAL
IN BRAZIL THEY COLLECT 90 PERCENT
IN THEIR INVISIBILITY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO BRAZIL I
AND HUMOR TO THE CAUSE IT BECAME MORE APPEALING
PEOPLE JOIN THE CAUSE BECAUSE IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE AND THEN I
PROVIDE A HEAVY HONEST AND ESSENTIAL WORK THAT BENEFITS THE ENTIRE POPULATION BUT THEY ARE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED FOR IT
GRAFFITI AND STREET ART AND THIS IS HOW I FIRST MET THESE MARGINALIZED SUPERHEROES I AM A GRAFFITI ARTIST AND ACTIVIST
PART OF OUR SOCIETY MUITO OBRIGADO THANK
VERY LOW PRICES THEY MAY COLLECT OVER 300 KILOS IN THEIR BAGS SHOPPING
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE LIVE ON A
FRAGILE ISLAND OF LIFE
IN A UNIVERSE OF POSSIBILITIES
FOR MANY MILLENNIA
HUMANS HAVE BEEN ON A JOURNEY TO FIND ANSWERS
ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT NATURALISM AND TRANSCENDENCE ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE ARE AND OF COURSE
WHAT EXACTLY IS SETI WELL SETI USES THE TOOLS OF ASTRONOMY TO TRY AND FIND EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE
INCEPTION AND IT WOULDN'T SIMPLY CHANGE EVERYTHING IT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE
SO IF THAT'S RIGHT WHY DID WE ONLY CAPTURE FOUR OUT OF THOSE 151 MINDS
I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM OF
COMPLETION AND DELIVERY BECAUSE
POSSIBLE
FOR US
TO HAVE A LONG FUTURE I THINK THIS IS WHAT DAVID DEUTSCH MEANT
IN 2005 WHEN HE ENDED HIS OXFORD TEDTALK BY SAYING HE HAD TWO PRINCIPLES HE'D LIKE TO SHARE FOR
LIVING
AND HE WOULD LIKE TO CARVE THEM ON STONE TABLETS THE FIRST IS
THAT PROBLEMS ARE INEVITABLE
THE SECOND IS THAT PROBLEMS ARE SOLUBLE
THE LONELINESS AND SOLIPSISM THAT HAS PLAGUED OUR SPECIES
ALL OF US ARE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PRIMORDIAL MIXTURE OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM EVOLVES FOR SO LONG THAT IT BEGINS TO ASK WHERE IT CAME FROM
NOT THE PINNACLE OF EVOLUTION WE ARE NOT THE DETERMINED
CENTURY NOW ALLOWS US TO BUILD BIGGER GLASSES MUCH BIGGER GLASSES
CREATIVE CHALLENGE AND IT WOULD CHANGE THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON IT AND THEN
EVER SINCE BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SEARCH THAT REMAINS ALL
OF
BILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTIONARY PLOTTING AND PLANNING WE ARE
ONE OUTCOME OF A CONTINUING
ADAPTATIONAL PROCESS
WE ARE RESIDENTS OF ONE SMALL PLANET IN A CORNER OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY
A VERY GOOD YEAR 2009 IS THE
OUR GALAXY WERE DEVOID OF LIFE THERE STILL 100 BILLION OTHER GALAXIES OUT THERE ALTOGETHER 10 22 STARS
NOW I'M GOING TO TRY A TRICK
AND RECREATE AN EXPERIMENT FROM THIS MORNING REMEMBER ONE BILLION
BUT THIS TIME NOT
PLANET INTO SMALLER ISLANDS AND ULTIMATELY WE ACTUALLY ALL BELONG TO ONLY ONE TRIBE
THE EXISTENCE OF EXTRA TERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE IT MERELY NOTES THE POSSIBILITY IF NOT THE PROBABILITY IN THIS VAST UNIVERSE WHICH SEEMS FAIRLY UNIFORM
GLASSES AND MORE HANDS IN THE WATER AND THEN WORKING TOGETHER MAYBE WE CAN ALL LIVE TO SEE THE DETECTION OF THE FIRST EXTRATERRESTRIAL SIGNAL
ARE WE ALONE
THE STORY OF HUMANS
IS THE STORY OF IDEAS
SCIENTIFIC IDEAS
THAT SHINE LIGHT INTO DARK CORNERS
IDEAS THAT WE EMBRACE RATIONALLY AND IRRATIONALLY IDEAS FOR WHICH WE'VE
LIVED AND DIED AND KILLED AND BEEN KILLED
LEADS WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DIVIDE AN ALREADY
DAY THAT EYE MAY BE THAT OF AN INTELLIGENT ALIEN AND THE
THE OPENING DAYS OF 2009
A VISIONARY PRESIDENT STOOD ON THE STEPS OF THE U S CAPITOL AND SAID
WE CANNOT HELP BUT BELIEVE THAT THE OLD HATREDS SHALL SOMEDAY PASS
THAT THE LINES OF TRIBE SHALL SOON DISSOLVE
THE WORLD GROWS SMALLER
OUR COMMON HUMANITY
SHALL REVEAL ITSELF SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE TED COMMUNITY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO FULFILL THIS WISH
AND
IN COLLABORATING WITH YOU
HASTEN THE DAY
THAT THAT VISIONARY STATEMENT CAN BECOME A REALITY
WE'RE BORN IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SUDAN OR CLOSE TO THE HEART OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY WE ARE THE PRODUCTS OF A BILLION YEAR LINEAGE OF WANDERING STARDUST
SAID SETI WHY WELL TO QUOTE THE DISCOVERY OF INTELLIGENT LIFE BEYOND EARTH WOULD
IS THE FIRST TELESCOPE BUILT FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL DISHES AND HOOKED TOGETHER WITH COMPUTERS IT'S MAKING SILICON AS IMPORTANT AS ALUMINUM AND WE'LL GROW IT IN THE FUTURE BY ADDING MORE ANTENNAS TO REACH 350 FOR MORE SENSITIVITY AND
AND SETI IS A MIRROR A MIRROR THAT CAN SHOW US OURSELVES FROM AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSPECTIVE
AND CAN HELP TO TRIVIALIZE THE DIFFERENCES AMONG US
IF SETI DOES NOTHING BUT CHANGE THE PERSPECTIVE OF HUMANS ON THIS PLANET THEN IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND ENDEAVORS IN HISTORY
WE'D LIKE TO AUGMENT
THE AUTOMATED SEARCH
WITH
HUMAN INSIGHT WE'D LIKE TO USE THE PATTERN RECOGNITION CAPABILITY
OF THE HUMAN EYE TO FIND
FAINT COMPLEX SIGNALS THAT OUR CURRENT ALGORITHMS MISS
AND OF COURSE WE'D LIKE TO INSPIRE AND ENGAGE THE NEXT GENERATION
WE'D LIKE
TO
TAKE THE MATERIALS THAT WE HAVE BUILT FOR EDUCATION AND GET THEM OUT TO STUDENTS EVERYWHERE STUDENTS THAT CAN'T COME AND VISIT US AT THE ATA WE'D LIKE TO
THE U N HAS DECLARED IT TO BE THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF ASTRONOMY A GLOBAL FESTIVAL TO HELP
US RESIDENTS OF EARTH REDISCOVER OUR COSMIC ORIGINS AND OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE AND IN 2009 CHANGE HAS COME TO WASHINGTON WITH A
EXTREMOPHILES ON EARTH ORGANISMS THAT CAN LIVE IN CONDITIONS TOTALLY INHOSPITABLE FOR
IF THEY LOOK UP AT THE NIGHT SKY AT THE SAME STARS
BUT FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE
WOULD THE DISCOVERY OF AN OLDER
CULTURAL CIVILIZATION OUT THERE
INSPIRE US
TO FIND WAYS TO SURVIVE OUR INCREASINGLY UNCERTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL
OUT OF CONCRETE THAT I STARTED TO SEE MORE AND MORE AROUND ME ALONG
TO BE 54 I ALSO CHARACTERIZE THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THAT PREDICTION SO IT WILL BE BETWEEN 46 DAYS AND 64 DAYS
THE CALM THE BEAUTY OF NATURE TO MY CHILDREN
AND I USE STATISTICS
TO ADDRESS THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN 2003 WE HAD IN EUROPE 35000 PEOPLE DYING DUE TO EXPOSURE TO VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES
SO WITH MY STATISTICAL METHODS I LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURES HOW THEY ARE INCREASING OVER TIME
HERE I'M PROJECTING GOING FROM 1990
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRENDS RIGHT NOW IN OUR SOCIETY
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT TREND IN SCIENCE IS THE ACCESS THAT WE HAVE TO BIG DATA WE HAVE BIG DATA EVERYWHERE
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE USE OF THE DATA THAT WE TRANSFORM THE DATA INTO VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE
LET ME JUST ILLUSTRATE WHAT REALLY BIG DATA IS ABOUT
WE HAVE NOW THE SQUARE KILOMETRE ARRAY
THAT'S THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL
RADIO TELESCOPE
THIS TELESCOPE IN ONE DAY IS ABLE TO GENERATE AS MUCH DATA AS WE HAVE ON THE INTERNET TODAY
IT HAS ENOUGH OPTICAL FIBER
SO WE PROJECT AND NOW MOVING FROM 1990 TO 2050 WE ARE GOING TO ALSO OBSERVE AN INCREASE IN THE VALUES OF THE OZONE
THAT INCREASE IS GOING TO CHANGE ACROSS THE SPACE
IT'S GOING TO BE GREATER IN THE MIDWEST
WE GOING TO EXPERIENCE ABOUT 12 INCREASE IN THE MIDWEST
ALONG THE COASTLINE THE INCREASE WILL BE ABOUT 4 SO
WE LOOK HOW THE POLLUTION IS IMPACTING HUMAN HEALTH
WE INTRODUCE STATISTICAL MODELS THAT HELP US TO LINK THE
BUT WE NEED TO SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS IN A WAY THAT CAN REACH YOU SO WE USE MAPS WE USE COLORS
IN THIS MAP WHEN THE COLOR IS GREEN THAT INDICATES THAT WE HAVE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF POLLUTION
AS THE COLOR GOES FROM GREEN ALL THE WAY TO PURPLE THAT INDICATES AN INCREASE IN THE LEVELS OF POLLUTION
WE ALSO HAVE
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHAT DOES THE MEAN
THAT'S WHAT WE GET
YOU SEE IT IN THE PICTURE IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT'S SANTA THAT COULD BE THE WIZARD OF HARRY POTTER
SO WE NEED MORE THAN THE MEAN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUMMARIZE THE DATA IN DIFFERENT WAYS WE NEED TO LOOK AT PERCENTILES AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE VARIABILITY THAT WE SEE ACROSS THE PICTURES
WE NEED TO CHARACTERIZE THE UNCERTAINTY IN OUR MEAN IN OUR ESTIMATE
OF WORKING JUST WITH THE MEAN HERE WE HAVE
OF STRESS STARTED INCREASING AS I WOULD SPEND TIME AWAY FROM NATURE I DIDN'T WANT TO
TO AVOID EXPOSURE TO VERY HIGH LEVELS
STATISTICIANS OFTEN SAY THAT A GREAT THING ABOUT BEING A STATISTICIAN IS THAT STATISTICIANS CAN PLAY IN EVERYONE'S BACKYARD
AND I LOVE BACKYARDS PARTICULARLY THE ONES THAT HAVE A LOT OF GREEN AREAS AND BEAUTIFUL TREES SO I CAN BRING MY CHILDREN IN THE BEAUTY OF NATURE
IN MY RESEARCH WHAT I DO I INTRODUCE THE STATISTICAL METHODS THE STATISTICAL TOOLS THAT CAN HELP US TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST RELEVANT ENVIRONMENTAL
FIGURE OUT THE ANSWERS
TO MY HOMEWORK
I WANTED TO USE NUMBERS I WANTED TO USE MATH TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME IMPORTANT REAL WORLD PROBLEMS
PROBLEMS THAT MATTERED TO ME ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS
THEN IS WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT STATISTICS
THAT IS A BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS THAT HELPS YOU TO TRANSFORM NUMBERS
INTO KNOWLEDGE
STATISTICS IS THE SCIENCE THAT EXTRACTS INFORMATION FROM DATA AND
WE APPLY THAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT OR TO MEDICINE
WE HAVE INTRODUCED PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
WHAT THAT
LISTENING TO HER BECAUSE I'M A GOOD MOTHER I'M SUPPOSED TO LISTEN WHEN MY KIDS ARE UNHAPPY
AND I'M THINKING HERE I HAVE A KID WHO'S AT A REALLY GOOD SCHOOL
SHE'S THRIVING ACADEMICALLY SHE HAS HAD THE SAME BOYFRIEND FOR OVER THREE YEARS A GUY THAT WE ACTUALLY REALLY
LIKE SHE'S THE PRESIDENT OF HER CLUB SOCCER TEAM SHE'S GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS
SHE'S FIVE FOOT EIGHT SHE'S BLOND SHE'S BLUE EYED SHE'S THIN SHE'S JUST LIKE ME
FINALLY YOU KNOW I'M TAKING HER WHOLE BIO PSYCHO SOCIAL HISTORY AND I SAID SO I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST I TEACH STRESS MANAGEMENT WHY ARE YOU HERE AND SHE SAYS BECAUSE EVERY TIME I OPEN A DRAWER WHERE I SEE CLUTTER I FEEL LIKE A FAILURE
THE AVERAGE WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY IS FIVE FOUR AND WEIGHS 140 POUNDS WHICH MEANS THAT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO OR HOW PERFECTIONISTIC WE ARE WE ARE NEVER GOING TO LOOK LIKE A MODEL
WHO IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T DO THAT AND IN FACT EVERY TIME A MALADAPTIVE PERFECTIONIST DOES SOMETHING WELL NEXT TIME THEY HAVE TO DO IT EVEN BETTER SO A 95 ON PHYSICS EXAM IS GOOD BUT NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TO GET A 97
THAT YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IN EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE WHICH COMES US TO THE MALADAPTIVE PERFECTIONIST
SO
BODY IMAGE EATING DISORDERS THEY'RE VERY SCARY IN ONE FIVE YEAR PERIOD IN THIS COUNTRY
THE PREVALANCE OF BULIMIA
WENT UP FIVE FOLD
PERFECTION IS AN ISSUE
THE AVERAGE MODEL IN THIS COUNTRY IS FIVE ELEVEN AND WEIGHS 117 POUNDS
JUST ONCE WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF AND SEE HOW NICE IT IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WHEN WE LOOK IN THE MIRROR
WE CRITICIZE OURSELVES WE PUT OURSELVES DOWN WHEN I WAS A KID MY FATHER USED TO SAY I WAS LAZY AND I
PROBABLY SPENT MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE TRYING TO GET THAT VOICE OUT OF MY HEAD THINK ABOUT THE VOICES YOU HEAR IN YOUR HEAD THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE NEED TO RECHALLENGE
I'M LISTENING TO HER I'M THINKING OKAY THERE WAS NEVER A COURSE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL ABOUT WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU ARE ENVIOUS OF ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS BECAUSE SHE IN FACT SOUNDED LIKE SHE HAD A REALLY GOOD
YOU SCORE TWO GOALS DURING A SOCCER GAME NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TO SCORE FOUR AND MALADAPTIVE PERFECTIONISTS ACTUALLY DON'T DO SO WELL THEIR GPA IS LOWER THAN ADAPTIVE PERFECTIONISTS THEIR ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE IS HIGHER AND THEY HAVE A VERY HIGH RISK OF
AND SHE REASSURED ME AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW DOESN'T MATTER PEOPLE ARE CREATIVE IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN SOME WOMEN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEIR HOUSE LOOK JUST SO AND ALI YOUR TALENTS LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE
UNTIL ONE DAY HER PROFESSOR HAD ALL THE STUDENTS DO PEER EDITING OF THEIR PAPERS AND SO SHE READ HER CLASSMATES' PAPERS
AND SHE REALIZED WHY SHE WAS GETTING AS
AND
YET SHE CONTINUED TO DO WELL BUT AT LEAST SHE REALIZED THAT HER PERFECTIONISM WAS DRIVING HER
TO FAR EXCEED HER PROFESSOR'S EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT STUDENT NEEDED TO DO
AND I WAS ASSIGNED DECEMBER WHICH IS REALLY UNFAIR BUT ANYWAY SO THE FIRST MONTH
I WENT TO BUNCO HAD A NICE TIME BUT I NOTICED
THAT THE WOMAN'S HOUSE WAS PERFECT
THERE WAS FURNITURE IN EVERY ROOM
THERE WERE PICTURES ON THE WALLS THE DRAPES MATCHED THE FURNITURE THE HOUSE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL
AND I STARTED TO GET ANXIOUS
IT'S HARD NOT TO BE A PERFECTIONIST
I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST I FIGHT THIS MYSELF EVERY DAY AND I REMEMBER A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I LIVE IN A TOWN A SUBURB OF BOSTON
AND MOST WOMEN IN MY TOWN DON'T WORK THEY'RE STAY AT HOME MOMS AND SO IT'S LONELY IF YOU ARE A WORKING MOM
AND SO I QUIT BUNCO
AND STILL TO THIS DAY HANG OUT WITH THE SAME WOMEN EVERY MONTH WE CALL IT GIRLS' NIGHT OUT DRINK WINE TALK ABOUT OUR FEELINGS AND WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT COLOR WALLS WE HAVE AND SO YOU CAN LET GO OF PERFECTIONISTIC TENDENCIES
WHILE WOMEN ON AVERAGE WORRY ABOUT TWELVE THINGS EVERY DAY SO IF YOU'RE PERFECTIONIST IF YOU'RE A WOMAN YOU'RE PROBABLY MORE LIKELY TO BE STRESSED SO IS THERE SUCH THING AS HEALTHY PERFECTIONISM
SHE COULDN'T EXPERIENCE COLLEGE LIFE SHE WASN'T ABLE TO ATTEND HER CLASSES SHE WASN'T ABLE TO GO TO SOCIAL EVENTS SHE WASN'T ABLE TO DRINK SHE WASN'T ABLE TO DO ANYTHING
BECAUSE SHE WAS PUSHING HERSELF SO HARD
TO EXCEL AT THAT SPORT AND SHE ENDED UP LEAVING COLLEGE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THAT
WE TALK ABOUT BODY IMAGE YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS ISSUE IN AMERICA NOW PEOPLE ARE EMBARRASSED TO EAT
SO WE TEACH OUR PATIENTS WHAT'S CALLED THE 80 20 PLAN SO IF 80 OF WHAT YOU EAT IS THE GOOD STUFF YOU KNOW THE WHOLE GRAINS THE FRUITS THE VEGETABLES THE NUTS THE BERRIES
THE GOOD STUFF THE OTHER 20 CAN BE WHAT YOU WANT
BECAUSE WHAT MY PATIENTS DO IS THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SWEET FOR FIVE DAYS AND THEN THEY EAT A BAG OF COOKIES
AND IT'S WHOLE LOT BETTER FOR YOU TO HAVE A COOKIE A COUPLE TIMES A DAY AND MAKE THAT YOUR 20
THAN TO DO IT EVERY FIVE DAYS
AND THAT STARTED MY INTEREST IN PERFECTIONISM
AND WHY IS IT
THAT WE DO TEND TO ZERO IN
ON THE ONE OR TWO THINGS IN OUR LIFE THAT'S WRONG
RATHER THAN EMBRACING THE THINGS IN OUR LIFE THAT'S RIGHT
AND I
WE ALWAYS COMPARE UP
WE LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO ARE SMARTER THAN US WHO ARE THINNER THAN US HAVE HAPPIER FAMILIES THAN US HAVE MORE MONEY THAN US WHO TRAVEL MORE THAN WE DO WHO HAVE MORE FRIENDS THAN WE DO BUT
DO ME A FAVOR
START COMPARING DOWN BECAUSE IF YOU COMPARE DOWN YOU'LL BE HEALTHIER
ONE OF MY PATIENTS ASKED ME LAST YEAR IS IT A GOOD THING OR BAD THING
TO COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE
AND MY ANSWER WAS IT'S GREAT THING TO COMPARE DOWN
COMPARING YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DOING AS WELL AS YOU IS REALLY GOOD FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO
SO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE BE CAREFUL HOW YOU JUDGE PEOPLE BECAUSE IN FACT PEOPLE MAY NOT BE AS PERFECT AS THEY LOOK SO WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT PERFECTIONISM ONE ARE PHYSICAL STRATEGIES
HER TO A FAMILY EVENT
AND SHE SPENT ALMOST THE ENTIRE CAR RIDE
COMPLAINING ABOUT ONE OF THE CLASSES SHE WAS TAKING SHE FOUND IT TO BE VERY DIFFICULT SHE FELT REALLY STUPID
AND SHE JUST
REALLY PERSEVERATED ABOUT THE HARD TIME SHE WAS HAVING
BEAUTIFUL EYES I HAVE GORGEOUS HAIR I LOVE MY CURVES I HAVE SUCH A STRONG SPIRIT I AM SO RESILIENT {NS} {NS} I'M SUCH GOOD FRIEND I'M A WONDERFUL MOTHER I'M A GREAT DAUGHTER
HAD A PATIENT COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHO WAS A STUDENT AT A DIFFERENT NESCAC SCHOOL SHE HAD BEEN RECRUITED TO THAT SCHOOL TO PLAY A SPORT
AND SHE CAME TO SEE ME BECAUSE SHE WAS SO STRESSED OUT
THAT HER PERFORMANCE IN THAT SPORT
WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HER AND SHE ALSO REALIZED
WHO SAID I KNOW IN MY TOWN I HAVE THIS IMAGE THAT WE ARE THE PERFECT FAMILY
SHE SAYS BUT I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH MY HUSBAND ANYMORE AND I INTEND TO LEAVE HIM AS SOON AS MY LAST KID GRADUATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL
AND MY OLDER SON IS ADDICTED TO MARIJUANA AND ONE OF MY OTHER KIDS WAS JUST ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING SO WE'RE NOT PERFECT
SO A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO I JOINED A BUNCO GROUP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT A BUNCO GROUP IS BUT IT'S LITERALLY YOU ROLL DICE IT'S LIKE YAHTZEE
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY DRINK A FAIR AMOUNT OF WINE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED ANY TALENT OR SKILL OR INSIGHT TO DO WELL AT BUNCO SO I JOINED BUNCO AND THE WAY IT WORKS IS THEY ASSIGN 12 WOMEN TOGETHER
AND YOU MEET AT EACH PERSON'S HOUSE ONCE A MONTH
RECOGNIZE HIDDEN ISSUES THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT PERSON
I CAN TELL YOU THIS I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERFECT PEOPLE AS PATIENTS THAT'S A LOT OF PS
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT PERSON EVERYBODY HAS ISSUES
THEY JUST SHOW IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS
PEOPLE HIDE THEIR ISSUES IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT EVERYBODY HAS ISSUES
OF THE THINGS THAT WAS HAPPENING WAS ONE OF
THE SPONSORS WAS DOING A SORT OF
BEAUTIFICATION A
CAMPAIGN FOR REAL BEAUTY THEY WANTED WOMEN TO RECOGNIZE THEIR BEAUTY
NOT IN A TRADITIONAL WAY
AND SO WHAT THEY DID AMONGST THE WHOLE EXHIBIT HALL
WAS THEY HAD THESE HUGE MIRRORS
AND ATTACHED TO EACH MIRROR WAS A PEN A SHARPIE AND
THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE SIGN
ON EACH MIRROR
AND IT SAID LOOK AT YOUR REFLECTION
AND WRITE DOWN SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL THAT YOU SEE AND
THERE'S ALCOHOLISM THERE'S ABUSE THERE'S INFIDELITY THERE'S GAMBLING THERE WAS A FAMILY IN OUR TOWN THAT I TRULY THOUGHT WAS THE PERFECT FAMILY
I DIDN'T KNOW THEM WELL BUT I KNEW THEM ENOUGH I SAW THEM SOCIALLY BOTH PARENTS HAD BIG JOBS THEY MADE A LOT OF MONEY
AND THEY WENT ON BEAUTIFUL TRIPS
BOTH PARENTS WERE VERY PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE THEY HAD THREE KIDS WHO WERE ALL EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE
ALL VERY ATHLETIC ALL VERY INTELLIGENT
ALL EXTREMELY POPULAR
AND SO EVERYONE'S IMAGE I REMEMBER ACTUALLY ONCE BEING AT A PARTY
AND WHEN THIS FAMILY WALKED IN EVERYONE SORT OF DEFLATED BECAUSE LIKE THE PERFECT FAMILY WAS THERE AND NO ONE ELSE WAS GOING TO LOOK GOOD IN COMPARISON
WELL AROUND THAT TIME I WAS WRITING A BOOK ON PERFECTIONISM
AND I SENT OUT A NOTICE SAYING I NEED PEOPLE TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR MY BOOK I WASN'T DOING THE INTERVIEWING MY WRITER WAS AND SO I COULD KEEP CONFIDENTIALITY
VOLUNTEERED IN THE KIDS' SCHOOL SHE VOLUNTEERED IN THE CHURCH SHE HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS SHE WAS VERY FIT SHE WAS A RUNNER SHE DIDN'T DRINK ALCOHOL SOCIALLY
41 OF
FIRST GRADERS
ARE AFRAID OF GETTING FAT
82 OF FOURTH GRADE GIRLS WISH THEY WERE THINNER
THE BMI OF MISS AMERICA WHEN THE PAGEANT STARTED
WAS 22
THE BMI NOW
IS 16 9
A WOMAN WITH A BMI OF 16 9
PROBABLY CAN'T GET PREGNANT BECAUSE SHE'S SO THIN
AND TIME CAME OPENED THE DOOR WOMEN WALKED IN
AND A WOMAN WALKED INTO MY FRONT HALL AND LOOKED UP AND SAID
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE WHITE WALLS
AND FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF HOURS WAS LIKE OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE WHITE WALLS YOU KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE WHITE WALLS
BUT AFTER ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS I THOUGHT WAIT A MINUTE
WHAT A WITCH WHO WALKS INTO YOUR HOUSE AND CRITICIZES THE COLOR OF YOUR WALLS AND I COULD FEEL ALL MY INNER PERFECTIONISM CRUMBLING AND I REALIZED IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER
WHAT COLOR WALLS MY HOUSE HAD
SO WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BADLY ABOUT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PERFECT GO FOR A WALK GO FOR A RUN GO FOR A SWIM GO FOR A WALK WITH A FRIEND EXERCISE IS VERY POWERFUL A STUDY JUST CAME OUT IN FACT SHOWING THAT MEDITATION
FINALLY FAMILY ISSUES IT'S SO EASY TO LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE
AND THINK THEY COME FROM A PERFECT FAMILY
AGAIN THAT'S WHAT WE SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA I CAN TELL YOU I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST IF YOU'RE PSYCHOLOGIST YOU'RE NOSY YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE THINGS YOU SEE PATIENTS WHO SEEM TO HAVE PERFECT FAMILIES THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AT THE END OF EACH DAY I WOULD WALK AROUND
AND LOOK AT WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THESE MIRRORS
AND IT WAS AMAZING
NOW REMEMBER THE WOMEN WHO CAME WERE NOT RICH THEY WERE NOT BEAUTIFUL THESE WERE TYPICAL AMERICAN WOMEN OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES ALL RACES ALL EVERYTHING
AND I WOULD WALK AROUND AND IT WOULD BE
SOCIAL GOALS
SOCIAL MEDIA I HAVE 15 YEAR OLD WHO SPENDS HALF HER LIFE
LOOKING AT SNAPCHAT AND INSTAGRAM
MOST OF MY PATIENTS LOOK AT FACEBOOK AND THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE DON'T POST BAD THINGS
PEOPLE DON'T POST UNFLATTERING PICTURES OF THEMSELVES
I SEE A LOT OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN MY PRACTICE AND THEY SAY ALL YOU SEE ON FACEBOOK IS THESE BLISSFUL PREGNANT WOMEN AND I'M LIKE YEAH PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO POST PICTURES OF THEMSELVES VOMITING
PEOPLE ONLY POST GOOD STUFF
BUT WHAT THEY ALSO POST IS PARTIES AND SOCIAL EVENTS THAT YOU MAY NOT GET INVITED TO AND IT CAUSES HURT FEELINGS AND IT REALLY AFFECTS OUR FEELING OF INCLUSION
BUT WHAT ARE THE TRIGGERS FOR PERFECTIONISM BODY IMAGE NUMBER ONE BODY IMAGE IS SUCH A BIG
IN FACT THERE IS IT'S CALLED ADAPTIVE PERFECTIONISM AND IN FACT YOU CAN BE A HEALTHY PERFECTIONIST YOU CAN THRIVE AT DOING SOME THINGS VERY WELL
AND YET HER WHOLE PERSONA WAS FOCUSED ON THE ONE THING IN HER LIFE THAT WASN'T GOING WELL
FAST FORWARD ABOUT A YEAR AND I WAS READING THE GALLEYS OF MY BOOK AND I READ A STORY AND IT WAS THIS
THE PARENTS WENT OFF TO THE SERVICE AND I WENT OFF WITH MY FRIEND TO THE LITTLE SUNDAY SCHOOL
AND AT THIS SUNDAY SCHOOL WE WERE GIVEN THESE BOOKLETS AND WHAT THE BOOKLETS WERE WERE THESE
REPRODUCTIONS OF WATERCOLORS THAT WERE PICTURES OF WILDFLOWERS AND BUTTERFLIES AND CLOUDS
OF OUR LIVES WE GOT OURSELVES IN THIS SITUATION WHERE SUDDENLY IT WAS LIKE IN THREE DAYS WE HAD TO BE OUT OF OUR HOUSE AND IN THIS OTHER HOUSE
OUR KIDS ARE SIX AND SEVEN SO THEY HAVE ALL THIS JUNK THAT KIDS ACCUMULATE AND ALL THESE YEARS WE'D JUST BEEN THROWING IT IN THE BASEMENT
WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT I HAD TO IN THREE DAYS BOX EVERYTHING UP AND JUST MOVE IT TO THE NEW HOUSE I DIDN'T GET TO GO THROUGH THINGS LIKE A GOOD CITIZEN DOES AND BRING THINGS TO GOODWILL
AND THE
THOUGH I COULDN'T LIVE IN A WORLD WITHOUT MY MOTHER I WAS LIVING IN ONE
THAT'S A POWERFUL POWERFUL RADICAL LESSON
I
REDEFINED STRENGTH
THAT STRENGTH WAS A VERY HUMBLE THING
THAT IT WAS TAKING THE NEXT STEP IT WAS GOING ONE MORE MILE IT WAS
LASTING ANOTHER DAY
I LEARNED SIMPLICITY I HAD REMEMBERED THAT FROM BACK IN MY YOUTH THAT THERE WAS POWER IN THE SIMPLE ACT OF
FINDING WATER AND MAKING YOUR DINNER AND WATCHING THE SUNSET
THOSE THINGS RESTORED ME IN WAYS THAT
I
CANNOT OVERSTATE
THEY REFORMED MY CORE
AND THEY HAVE INFORMED EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE SINCE
SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THAT
I DO THINK THE JOURNEY TO EXTRAORDINARY IS THROUGH THE TRUE ROOT
FINDING IN OURSELVES THAT VOICE THAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE THAT WE RECOGNIZE AS THE VOICE THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE
SOMETIMES IT'S IN THE FORM OF A CALLING
LIKE
THAT CALLING I THINK I EXPERIENCED WHEN I GOT THAT LITTLE BOOKLET THAT I CAN'T BRING YOU
AND SOMETIMES IT COMES LATER IN LIFE
WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE ON THE WRONG PATH OR YOU'RE MARRIED TO THE WRONG PERSON OR
YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO HAVE KIDS AND SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE THAT YOU MUST
I
THINK THAT THAT IS
SUCH POWERFUL AND FUNDAMENTAL
INGREDIENT OF
THAT REACH TO EXTRAORDINARY I KEEP SAYING REACH TO
EXTRAORDINARY
I THINK WE'RE ALL ORDINARY IN THIS ROOM
AND I THINK WE'RE ALL EXTRAORDINARY TOO THE LINE BETWEEN THOSE THINGS IS VERY
IT WAS THE MOST HEROIC THING THAT I HAD EVER DONE
AND THAT SUFFERING WAS THE GREATEST THAT I HAD EVER SUFFERED I WAS OUT THERE TRYING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH MY OWN
LIFE WHICH IS THE THING YOU ALL HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH
WE ALL DO IT'S BEING HUMAN
I DID I LEARNED HOW TO BE RESILIENT
I LEARNED ABOUT
I
GUESS THE FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH HERE I WAS CARRYING THIS WEIGHT I COULDN'T BEAR I BORE IT
YESTERDAY WHEN I REALIZED I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT FIRST REVELATION I THOUGHT SINCE I DON'T HAVE ANY FANCY SLIDES OR VIDEOS LIKE OTHERS HAVE I JUST HAVE ME
I THOUGHT I WOULD BRING THAT BOOK BECAUSE I ENDED UP SAVING IT ALL THESE YEARS SORT OF BY ACCIDENT IT
WAS
IN MY BASEMENT SOMEWHERE I KNEW THAT I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO MY BASEMENT
I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT MY BASEMENT IF THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS THING
WERE IN MY BASEMENT THEY WOULD HAVE RESCINDED THE INVITATION
BECAUSE IT REALLY CLEARLY IDENTIFIES ME AS NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING AT ALL IN FACT A RATHER SHAMEFUL ONE MAYBE SOME OF YOU RELATE I'M HOPING SOME OF YOU RELATE
I HAVE AN EXCUSE AS TO WHY MY BASEMENT IS SO HIDEOUS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO MY HUSBAND AND I
AND OUR KIDS MOVED THE
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE BEEN
FOUND OUT I COULDN'T DO THAT THAT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
SO THEN I DECIDED TO SELF DESTRUCT THAT IN SOME WAYS IN
RETROSPECT I CAN SEE THAT WAS A WAY
OF HONORING MY MOTHER TO SAY
I CANNOT BEAR THIS WORLD WITHOUT HER AND SO
I WON'T I ACTUALLY CAME TO PORTLAND I WAS LIVING IN MINNEAPOLIS
I
GOT INVOLVED WITH DRUGS I WAS PROMISCUOUS I DID A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE REALLY
HARMFUL
TO MYSELF AND ALSO RAN AT A CROSS CURRENT TO THAT RADICAL SINCERITY THAT CORE ROOT WITHIN ME IT
I'D NEVER HEARD OF THIS TRAIL I READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS IT'S A WILDERNESS NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL THAT GOES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER TO JUST PAST THE CANADIAN BORDER THOUGH CALIFORNIA OREGON AND WASHINGTON
UP THE CREST OF THE PACIFIC CREST THE SIERRA NEVADA AND THE CASCADE RANGE
I PUT IT BACK ON THE SHELF BUT I RETURNED
SOON AFTER AND BOUGHT THAT BOOK
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT
I HAD TO
DO SOMETHING
INCREDIBLE OR EXTRAORDINARY EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT INCREDIBLE AND EXTRAORDINARY
I DECIDED TO HIKE
A TRAIL THAT I'D NEVER HEARD OF I WAS LIVING IN MINNESOTA AT THE TIME I WAS A WAITRESS
AND I WAS STANDING IN LINE AT AN REI STORE JUST OUTSIDE OF MINNEAPOLIS I WAS BUYING A SHOVEL THERE HAD BEEN A BLIZZARD AND I NEEDED TO DIG MY TRUCK OUT
I SAW THIS GUIDEBOOK
THAT WAS ON THE SHELF
AS I WAS WAITING TO BUY MY SHOVEL I PICKED IT UP AND IT SAID THE PACIFIC CREST TRAIL VOLUME ONE
I COULDN'T FORGET THAT I COULD NOT FORGET IN THE MIDST
OF
MY DARKEST HOUR HOW MUCH MY MOTHER LOVED ME
SHE USED TO
WITH MY BROTHER SISTER AND I WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP SHE USED TO PLAY THIS GAME THAT I JUST DID WITH MY OWN KIDS THIS MORNING
SHE WOULD SAY DO I LOVE YOU THIS MUCH
AND WE'D SAY NO
DO I LOVE YOU THIS MUCH AND WE'D SAY NO
THIS MUCH NO ON AND ON AND ON
UNTIL SHE WAS REACHING AS WIDE AS SHE COULD REACH
AND THE ANSWER WAS ALWAYS NO
THE ANSWER WAS
ALWAYS
THAT THE AMOUNT THAT SHE LOVED US WAS NOT CONTAINABLE IT WAS NOT WITHIN
I BEGAN MY HIKE IN THE MOJAVE DESERT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING
I PUT WAY TOO MUCH STUFF IN MY BACKPACK I
THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT BACKPACKERS DID YOU JUST CARRIED A BUNCH OF SHIT OUT THERE
I SHOULD SAY FOR MONTHS THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS EVENT WOULD EMAIL ME AND CALL ME AND SAY DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I SAID
NO I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
IS
WHAT DOES THIS EXPERIENCE MEAN WHAT'S THE GREATER MEANING
I THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY
WONDERFUL
METAPHOR FOR WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY
AND THAT IS
OUR DEEPEST TREASURES
ARE BURIED IN THE CRAPPY DETRITUS IN OUR
LIVES YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF THAT REACH FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY IS BOUND
UP IN
THE SELF DOUBT THE SELF LOATHING THE DARKNESS THE DIFFICULTY THE THINGS THAT WE BURY
I THINK THAT EVERYONE WHO CAME UP HERE AND STOOD BEFORE YOU TODAY
KNOWS THAT TO
BE TRUE
THAT WHAT WE ACCOMPLISH IS BUILT ON
WHAT WE FAILED AT
WHAT WE TRIED AT WHAT WE HOPE TO DO BETTER
I KEEP SAYING WE MOVED BUT ACTUALLY MY HUSBAND WHO'S IN THE ROOM A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MAN BUT USELESS AT PACKING
IT WAS LIKE THE CATS WERE MORE ASSISTANCE IN THIS MOVE THAN HE WAS
I'M BY MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN THE BASEMENT BOXING THINGS UP ON TOP OF THIS I HAVE A 101 DEGREE FEVER BECAUSE I'VE SUDDENLY
BECOME ILL
I HAD REACHED THIS MOMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON ONE OF THESE NIGHTS PACKING WHERE INSTEAD OF BEING REASONABLE AND WRITING THINGS LIKE KITCHEN UTENSILS AND KIDS TOYS
ON THE BOXES
THE
INNER ME WAS REALLY COMING OUT
SO ON THE BOXES I WOULD WRITE
USELESS CRAP YOU'RE TOO PATHETIC TO GET RID OF
THEN I'D TAPE IT UP
PANTS YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE TOO FAT TO FIT INTO SO LET IT GO YOU KNOW AND TAPING THAT UP SO THIS IS WHAT I HAD TO ENCOUNTER YESTERDAY WHEN I REVISIT MY BASEMENT BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'VE NOT UNPACKED THESE BOXES
THINGS I'VE DONE SINCE
MOTHERING HAVING MY TWO CHILDREN
LOVING THEM THE WAY MY MOTHER LOVED
ME
MARRYING MY HUSBAND AND BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP THAT FEEDS
US BOTH AND SUSTAINS US BOTH AND SUSTAINS OUR FAMILY
AND WRITING MY BOOKS
I'VE WRITTEN THREE BOOKS NOW AND EVERY
BOOK
EVERY DAY EVERY TIME I WRITE IT'S SO HARD IT'S JUST AS HARD AS IT WAS ON THE TRAIL STRAPPING ON THAT BACKPACK AND WALKING ANOTHER DAY
WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD FIRST OR SECOND GRADE AND I HAD SPENT THE NIGHT AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING I WENT WITH HER FAMILY TO CHURCH
REACH I'M HOPING THAT ALL OF YOU
IN THIS ROOM HAVE BEEN LOVED LIKE THAT
BECAUSE ONCE YOU ARE LOVED THAT WAY
I DO THINK IT'S ALWAYS
WITH YOU
ULTIMATELY WHAT I REALIZED IN THE MIDST OF
MY MOST DIFFICULT HOUR
WHICH WAS REALLY LIKE A DIFFICULT TWO OR THREE YEARS
IS THAT
THAT LOVE EXISTED IN EVERY CELL OF ME
AND
THE GREATEST HONOR TO MY MOTHER WOULD BE TO LIVE MY LIFE AS IF THAT WERE TRUE
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TRUEST TRUTH I DECIDED TO DO THAT
BUT I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO SPEND MY LIFE TRYING TO HARNESS THAT I WAS GOING TO TRY TO WITH WORDS CAPTURE THAT KIND OF BEAUTY
SO I'M OUT THERE AND I'M CARRYING ALL THIS STUFF AND I LITERALLY CANNOT STAND UP I'M HUNCHING IN A REMOTELY UPRIGHT POSITION
AND
THE PACK EVERYWHERE IT MAKES CONTACT WITH MY BODY IS RUBBING MY SKIN AWAY AND MY FEET ARE BLISTERING I DON'T ENCOUNTER ANOTHER HUMAN BEING IN THE FIRST EIGHT DAYS OF MY HIKE I WAS OUT THERE 94 DAYS IT BECAME THE NORM THAT I WOULD GO DAYS ON END WITHOUT SEEING ANOTHER PERSON
ALL OF THAT WAS INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT FOR ME AND INTERESTING TO ME
AND GOOD FOR ME I FINISHED MY TRIP AT THE BRIDGE OF THE GODS
AT THE COLUMBIA RIVER IN CASCADE LOCKS OREGON
TWO DAYS BEFORE MY 27TH BIRTHDAY ON SEPTEMBER 15 1995
WHAT I
LEARNED IN THAT JOURNEY I JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST HIKED 11000 MILES OF THE PCT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIKED A LOT LONGER A LOT BETTER THEY ARE LOT MORE
INCREDIBLE IN WHAT THEY DID AND ALSO MY SUFFERING I WAS 22 AND I LOST MY MOM TO CANCER
I'M NOT ALONE IN THAT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF YOU HAVE SUFFERED AND SO I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT MY SUFFERING WAS GREATER NOR THAT THE JOURNEY I WAS ON WAS ANY MORE HEROIC
THAN ANYTHING ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE AND OUTDONE TO BE CERTAIN
LOST MY HOME IT WAS MY WAY OF SEEKING THAT OUT SO I COULD FIND MY FOOTING AGAIN SO I DID THAT AND I BEGAN MY HIKE IT WAS THE SUMMER OF 1995 I WAS 26 YEARS
I HAD A QUESTION IT WAS CAN I SAY SHIT {LG} THEY SAID YES
SOMEDAY THAT IS TOO THE TITLE OF MY TALK RADICAL SINCERITY WE OFTEN USE THIS WORD RADICAL
I THINK IN A WAY THAT ISN'T QUITE WHAT IT MEANS WE THINK OF RADICAL WE THINK OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
OUTSIDE AND EXTREME AND AGITATING IN SOME WAY OR BRINGING IN OUTSIDE IDEAS BUT REALLY THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD RADICAL IS OF THE ROOT
OF THE ORIGIN THE FUNDAMENTAL
AND SINCERE MEANS TRUE
THE NATURAL WONDERS AND ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE TO THESE PICTURES
WERE LITTLE POEMS AND LYRIC DESCRIPTIONS
OF THE IMAGES
I
KNEW I LOVED BOOKS BY THEN I'D BEEN A READER MY MOTHER HAD ALWAYS READ TO ME AND I HAD ALREADY FOSTERED A
REAL LOVE OF BOOKS BUT I NEVER HAD ENCOUNTERED THE FEELING THAT I HAD WHEN I READ THOSE DESCRIPTIONS
I FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME
I SAW THE POWER OF WORDS I SAW THAT THEY COULD HARNESS A BEAUTY THAT ABSOLUTELY PIERCED ME
I
IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME THAT YOU COULD BE BORING AND EXCITING COMMONPLACE AND
WE TRY AND BE EXCITING RIGHT AWAY WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT DOING THAT STRUCTURE PART BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS BORING BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE KEY
IN SOCIETY PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO WITH YOUR GUTS YOU HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING YOU HAVE TO JUMP IN BUT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF
EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT THEY'VE HAD PROJECT THAT THEY PUT OFF FOR A DAY OR WEEK OR A MONTH OR A YEAR
ON YOUR BRAIN THEY ARE ALL USING THAT SAME FIVE TO NINE ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE FOR YOUR WORKING MEMORY SO IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO COME UP WITH FAIRLY SIMPLE CHART HERE THIS IS HOW MANY
AND I GET TO DO THEM BETTER THAN I COULD IF I'D FOCUSED ON THE THINGS I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT SO THE SECOND THING THAT BORING PEOPLE DID WAS THEY REDUCED TO THE
I FOUND A FEW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM TODAY BUT I LAUGHED WHEN I FOUND THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO BORING
TIME WE'VE HAD MORE THAN THOSE FIVE TO NINE MENTAL JUGGLING BALLS AND SOME OF THEM STARTED FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS SO HOW DO WE MANAGE THIS I'LL USE A BIT OF
WE KNOW THAT'S TRUE
WE KNOW THAT WE NOW HAVE TOO MANY CHOICES THAT THOSE CHOICES START TO HURT US BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID OF MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE SOMETIMES WE ARE SO AFRAID THAT WE DON'T MAKE ANY CHOICE AT ALL AND WE JUST GO WITHOUT
I
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE
TWO THINGS WE WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF IT ALL AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LIVES ARE ONLY FILLED WITH THE THINGS WE LOVE TO GIVE
IS EFFECTIVELY UNLIMITED WHEN WE OFF BOARD THAT INFORMATION TO THEM WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN FOCUS ALL OF OUR ATTENTION ALL OF OUR ENERGY ON TO JUST ONE OR TWO PROJECTS AT A TIME WE CAN REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT
STUFF
BUT A CALCULATOR IS PERFECT AT IT IT WILL NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE
SO WHAT WE DO IS A DIVISION OF LABOR WE TELL THE CALCULATOR TO DO THE CALCULATING AND WE DO THE ACTUAL MATH
BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN
BY THE SAME TOKEN WE ARE TERRIBLE AT REMEMBERING WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AND WHEN WE HAVE TO DO IT
SO THE ONLY LOGICAL THING THEN IS TO GIVE THAT UP TO AN EXTERNAL TOOL THAT CAN DO IT BETTER THAN
US WE HAVE THESE AND WE'VE HAD THEM SINCE WE WERE IN GRADE THREE
ABOUT THE FIRST THREE THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS IDEA OF THE MAGICAL
IS ALWAYS WHAT SOMEONE ELSE THOUGHT IT'S ALWAYS WHAT WE HEARD IN THE NEWS IT'S ALWAYS WHAT OUR PARENTS OR PROFESSORS OR FRIENDS TOLD US IN ORDER
THING I FOUND WAS THAT BORING PEOPLE WHO DID AMAZING THINGS WROTE THINGS DOWN NOTHING EXCITING
ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK IT IS IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
GOING TO START TODAY WITH A QUOTE BY GUSTAVE FLAUBERT HE SAID BE
VALUE FOR US AND THAT WE CAN STILL ADD VALUE TO THEM JOHN F KENNEDY SAID THAT WE NEED MEN WHO CAN DREAM OF
THERE AGENDAS TO DO LISTS CALENDARS NOTEBOOKS SIMPLE BORING THINGS BUT THEY WILL NEVER FORGET THEIR
LIFE UP FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS AND I HADN'T THOUGHT WHETHER THOSE THINGS STILL HAD VALUE TO ME
I HADN'T QUESTIONED WHETHER I COULD CONTINUE ADDING VALUE WHETHER THOSE THINGS WERE STILL MAKING ME HAPPY
SO IN ORDER TO REALLY ROUND THIS OUT WE NEED TO DO THE THIRD THING THAT BORING PEOPLE
BY LETTING SOME OF THOSE MENTAL JUGGLING BALLS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS WHEN WE DO THIS
US LESS EXCITING IN SOME WAYS
BUT WHAT THEY ALLOWED US TO DO WAS THEY ALLOWED US TO FOCUS
THEY ALLOWED US TO DO MORE AMAZING THINGS IN OTHER WAYS
SO THAT STRUCTURE WASN'T AN INHIBITOR OF CREATIVITY AS I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS STRUCTURE WAS ACTUALLY AN ENABLER OF CREATIVITY IT WAS
WHAT I GET TO DO IS I GET TO STOP FOCUSING ON THESE BOTTOM TWO AND I GET TO FOCUS ON THE TOP THE THINGS THAT I LOVE WHETHER I HAVE
DAY OF HIS LIFE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY BORING WAY TO LIVE BUT WHAT THESE GUYS
THOUGHT BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING UP WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING AT US WE USUALLY DON'T GIVE IT ANY MORE
STOP AND TAKE STOCK OF WHAT WE HAVE WHEN WE TAKE STOCK OF WHAT WE HAVE WE
FUNNY IT MAKES IT HARDER TO EAT OUT THAT'S FOR SURE BUT
THESE AS MENTAL JUGGLING BALLS AS SOON AS WE HAVE MORE THAN FIVE TO NINE THINGS IN THE AIR
SOME OF THEM START TO DROP OFF
THINK ABOUT YOUR SCHEDULES
IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE MINE I IMAGINE LOT OF YOURS ARE THERE ARE DOZENS OF EVENTS
MEETINGS APPOINTMENTS CLASSES
AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROJECTS GOING ON AS WELL
BUT I THOUGHT MORE ABOUT IT AND REALIZED IT WASN'T ABOUT BEING A BORING PERSON BORING PEOPLE ARE UNORIGINAL THEY ARE UNEXCITING
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M AFRAID OF AND IT SHOULDN'T BE WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS AFRAID OF EITHER
WE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY DOING THE THINGS WE LOVE
WHERE WE'RE NOT CONSTANTLY REEVALUATING WHETHER THE THINGS IN OUR LIVES ARE ACTUALLY IMPORTANT TO US
AND WHERE WE'RE NOT SETTING UP PLANS TO ACTUALLY DO THE THINGS WE LOVE
THAT'S THE WORLD THAT I'M AFRAID OF
BECAUSE WHEN WE BECOME
A LITTLE BIT
AFTER READING ALL THE SCHOLARLY WORK
I WONDERED WHY NOBODY HAD USED BIO SENSORS TO DEVELOP A PREGNANCY LIKE URINE TEST FOR DIAGNOSING DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER
CURIOUS ABOUT THIS LARGE GAP IN RESEARCH
I CONTACTED FACULTY AT LOCAL COLLEGES ABOUT HOW I COULD HELP EXPLORE THIS RESEARCH PROBLEM
I SOON REALIZED THAT MOST LABS IN MY HOMETOWN OF MONTGOMERY ALABAMA
DID NOT HAVE SPOTS FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS EVEN IF THEY DID THEY WOULDN'T LET A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT RESEARCH THAT FREELY
BUT FINALLY AFTER BEGINNING TO REGRET SENDING A SPAM LIKE MESSAGE
I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A PROFESSOR OF HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL WHO TOLD ME THAT IF I SENT RECOMMENDATION LETTERS AND MY RESUME I COULD LIKELY CONDUCT MY RESEARCH IDEA AT HER LAB
NEVER THE RIGHT ANSWER ACCORDING TO VLADIMIR BUKOVSKY A FAMOUS NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST WE AS A VAST WESTERN CIVILIZATION OPPOSE EXTREME THOUGHTS BECAUSE WE LIKE TO THINK THAT THE COMPROMISE BETWEEN TWO POLAR IDEAS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE RIGHT
INSTEAD OF PEACE WE THINK OF TERRORISM
INSTEAD OF GOVERNMENT WE THINK OF ANARCHY
AND INSTEAD OF NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS WE THINK OF PSYCHOPATHS
ANOTHER REASON WE DON'T LIKE RADICAL IDEAS IS BECAUSE WE AS HUMANS THINK THAT THE EXTREME ANSWER IS
SOME SAID NO NICELY SOME IGNORED MY EMAIL SOME OFFERED THEIR OWN CRITICAL REPLIES AND SOME SIMPLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHEN THEY ASKED QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT COLLEGE DO YOU GO TO
I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ANYONE WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO AN EXTREME IDEA FROM A 15 YEAR OLD KID BUT DESPITE HOW ODD IT SEEMED AND HOW FOREIGN THE IDEA WAS TO
DID IT ANYWAY BECAUSE I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE AND TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M TELLING THE COMPLETE STORY OF WHAT I LEARNED IN THE PROCESS
DIDN'T EXACTLY ENCOURAGE ME EITHER
SO WHEN I RECEIVED A POSITIVE EMAIL FROM MY TO BE MENTOR I WAS STILL SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL OF WHETHER I'D BE ABLE TO GO AND RESEARCH
ANOTHER PROBLEM ALSO EXISTED THE PROFESSOR WHO'D CONTACTED ME WAS A PROFESSOR WHO LIVED IN
HOWEVER WITH THE PRESENCE OF ONE POSITIVE REPLY
ONE EMOTION TRUMPED ALL
DETERMINATION
I STARTED TO BELIEVE THAT RADICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS EMAILING RESEARCHERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES COULD HAVE A POSITIVE RESULT THAT THE ORDINARY PERSON WOULD EASILY OVERLOOK
BECAUSE MY PARENTS DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL TWO WEEKS AFTER I SENT THE EMAILS
I LEARNED MANY BASIC LAB TECHNIQUES SUCH AS COUNTING CELLS AND HANDLING MICROPIPETTES
I ALSO LEARNED HOW TO USE INTERNET DATABASES TO FIND SCHOLARLY ARTICLES ONLINE
IN FACT AS A HIGH SCHOOLER I WAS TOLD TO USE THESE DATABASES TO WRITE REVIEW PAPER FOR MY PROFESSOR
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THESE ARTICLES BUT OVER TIME I BEGAN GETTING SIDETRACKED INTO OTHER INTERESTING TOPICS
THUS I ENCOURAGE YOU
TO OPEN YOURSELF UP TO NON TRADITIONAL COMPLETELY NEW EXPERIENCES TO DIVERSIFY YOUR THOUGHT AND EXPLORE NEW GROUND
VOLUNTEER GO TO THAT NEW RESTAURANT
EXPLORE THAT NEW IDEA YOU HAD
BUT NEVER LET AWKWARDNESS OR FEAR OF BECOMING DIFFERENT SCARE YOU
AS A FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANT AMERICAN I KNOW HOW IT IS TO SPEAK DIFFERENTLY ACT DIFFERENTLY AND FEEL DIFFERENTLY BUT ULTIMATELY WANTING TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND SOMETIMES TAKE THE RADICAL APPROACH IS ONE OF THE REASONS I LIVE ON AND IS WHAT I CHALLENGE YOU TO DO
THANK
ON A WHIM I EMAILED TO DOZENS OF PROFESSORS A PROPOSAL TO DESIGN A SIMPLE BIO SENSOR URINE TEST FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS I STILL REMEMBER HOW DUMB I FELT IMMEDIATELY
MILES AWAY FROM MY HOMETOWN OF MONTGOMERY SO TO HAVE THE IDEA TRULY WORK OUT NOT ONLY DID I HAVE TO GATHER THE PERMISSION OF MY PARENTS TO GO AND WORK IN ANOTHER CITY BUT ALSO I HAD TO FIND A PLACE TO STAY ONCE I GOT THERE
HOWEVER OVER THE COURSE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AFTER CONVINCING MY PARENTS IT'D BE VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FINALLY
AND
AFTER FINDING A PLACE TO STAY THROUGH DISTANT CONNECTIONS IT ALL WORKED OUT
SURE I HAD NO PERSONAL CONTACTS BUT AFTER BROWSING THROUGH TONS OF ARTICLES ONLINE I REALIZED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS WHO FREELY LISTED THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION
WE LIVE IN AN EXTREMELY PASSIONATE SOCIETY
SO WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF AN AMAZING TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION
IN GENETICS
SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED WAYS TO DIRECTLY MANIPULATE THE GENOME OF VARIOUS ORGANISMS TO CHANGE THEIR PROPERTIES
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WHICH I THINK IS AN
SCARY STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING OUR LEADERS ARE INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR POSITIONS AND SO ARE WE WHAT THIS GRAPHIC SHOWS IS THIS GRAPHIC SHOWS THE VOTING RECORDS OF SENATORS OVER TIME
IS THAT WE CAN ALL WIN THESE ARE NOT ZERO SUM GAMES WE CAN ALL WIN BUT PASSION IS NOT ENOUGH PASSION HAS TO BE BASED ON FIRM GROUNDING OF UNDERSTANDING THANKS
THEN HERE'S THE KICKER WHAT DO YOU DO YOU ASK PEOPLE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN EXPLAIN HOW A TOILET WORKS WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS THIS IS WHAT
IS THAT IN GENERAL PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THINGS IN PRETTY DETAILED WAY
WE TEND TO TAKE THESE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUES AND WE SEE THEM AS ZERO SUM GAMES
POLITICS YOU GUYS PROBABLY NEED NO REMINDERS ABOUT POLITICS WITH THE NONSENSE THAT'S GOING ON IN
LIKE A CLOUD AN ANALOGY TO A CLOUD WHEN YOU SEE A CLOUD FROM A DISTANCE WHAT DO YOU SEE
LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT TRUE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS TRUE LATER ON IN THIS STUDY WE ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS GMO AND THIS IS WHAT WE
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE BIG SOCIETAL ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TALK
THAT'S THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN STUDYING IN MY LAB
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN A VARIETY OF STUDIES IS I'VE BEEN EXPLORING
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS IDEA
SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF EXPERIMENTS
JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SOME OF OUR FINDINGS
IN
THIS STUDY WHAT WE DO IS
WE BRING PEOPLE
AND WE ASK THEM ABOUT SOME OF THESE REALLY PRESSING SOCIETAL ISSUES
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN HERE
ARE
BICYCLE RIDERS
BIKE AFICIONADOS
OK NOW HOW MANY OF GUYS THINK YOU KNOW HOW A BIKE WORKS
OKAY I'VE MADE YOU GUYS NERVOUS
THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD
WELL A
PSYCHOLOGIST STUDIED THIS QUESTION AND HE WANTED TO KNOW DO PEOPLE KNOW HOW A BIKE WORKS
AND JUST FOR YOUR
THEN IN THIS CONDITION WE
ASKED PEOPLE TO GIVE US REASONS FOR WHY THEY HOLD THE POSITION THAT THEY DO
WHY ARE YOU FOR INSTANCE IN FAVOR OF THAT EXPLAIN IT
NO I'M SORRY NOT EXPLAIN IT BUT PROVIDE REASONS FOR IT
THEN WE GAVE THEM SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WE SAID
DO YOU WANT TO DONATE THIS TO AN ADVOCACY GROUP THAT ADVOCATES IN FAVOR OF YOUR POSITION
OKAY
WHAT WE FIND
DON'T THINK TOO HARD ABOUT IT JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR SENSE IS OKAY DO YOU KNOW HOW A TOILET WORKS JUST THINK ABOUT IT REAL QUICKLY AND GIVE YOU SENSE
WHAT MAKES US SO PASSIONATE ABOUT OUR POSITIONS WELL I THINK ONE CRITICAL ELEMENT
IS THAT WE THINK WE'RE RIGHT
NOW THAT SOUNDS TRIVIAL THAT MIGHT SOUND TRIVIAL
BUT I THINK IT'S DEEPLY IMPORTANT
OKAY
WE THINK WE'RE RIGHT THOSE GMO PROTESTERS
THEY THINK THEY'RE RIGHT THAT IF WE INTRODUCE THIS THERE'S GOING TO BE REALLY BAD CONSEQUENCES THE PEOPLE IN FAVOR OF GMO THINK THEY'RE RIGHT
THAT IF WE INTRODUCE THIS IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT THEY FEEL REALLY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT SAME THING WITH OUR POLITICIANS
HERE'S THE QUESTION THAT I WANT YOU GUYS TO CONTEMPLATE
TODAY AND HOPEFULLY I'LL INSPIRE YOU GUYS TO THINK ABOUT THIS QUESTION
IS ALL ABOUT PASSION PASSION IS SUPER IMPORTANT PASSION IS GREAT BUT
LOT OF THEM AVID BIKE RIDERS
AND HE GAVE THEM PARTS OF THE BIKE LIKE THE WHEELS AND THE HANDLEBARS AND SUCH AND HE GAVE THEM A SIMPLE TEST HE SAID
JUST DRAW IN WHERE THE PEDALS GO DRAW IN WHERE THE CHAIN GOES AND DRAW IN WHERE THE FRAME GOES
OKAY I'M GOING TO SHOW A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT PEOPLE CAME UP WITH
HERE'S ONE
THIS IMAGE IS OF ANTI GMO PROTESTERS TEARING UP ONE OF THE TEST FIELDS THAT WAS USED TO TEST THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THIS GOLDEN RICE
THEY REALIZE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE
SO PEOPLE ARE REASONABLE ONCE THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY MODERATE THEIR POSITIONS
BUT
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF YOU ASK THEM TO GENERATE REASONS
OKAY
THIS IS THE FINAL THOUGHT I'M GOING
NOW I'M NOT TRYING TO IMPLY THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS OPPOSED TO GMO HOLDS THIS FALSE BELIEF I PURPOSELY PICKED THIS EXAMPLE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S PROBABLY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT GMO IT'S A HOT TOPIC
MAYBE YOU'RE FOR MAYBE YOU'RE AGAINST IT
WHAT I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO DO THOUGH IS
TO THINK ABOUT IT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT GENETIC MODIFICATION
DO YOU KNOW ENOUGH
TO HOLD THE POSITION THAT YOU DO AS STRONGLY AS YOU
WHAT HAPPENS IF INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM TO LIST REASONS FOR THEIR POSITION WE ASK THEM TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS
REMARKABLY PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE BEEN STUDYING THIS OKAY AND
THAT MAKES CARROTS ORANGE
BETA CAROTENE IS A PRECURSOR TO VITAMIN A
VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY IT'S ESTIMATED KILLS SOMEWHERE AROUND 670000 CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
AND THE IDEA IS THAT BY INTRODUCING THIS NEW FORM OF RICE TO THOSE PLACES
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DECREASE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY
SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS
OH THAT IS ME 2012 WAS A SPECIAL YEAR FOR ME BECAUSE THAT IS THE YEAR THAT I GOT INDEFINITE LEAVE TO REMAIN IMMIGRATION STATUS
AROUND JUST GET BY
WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE
ARE RACIST VANS OK
AND IT'S A MINORITY BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ONE
BUT POLITICIANS DO NOT MEET THAT CHALLENGE HEAD ON INSTEAD
OF ADDRESSING PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT
LIVING WITH CHANGE AND DIFFERENCE PRESSURES ON SERVICES
OF THEIR IRE SEEMS TO BE RESERVED FOR EASTERN EUROPEAN MIGRANTS NOT THAT THAT'S OK
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE THE RHETORIC OF FEAR
CREATES AN ATMOSPHERE THAT'S TOXIC TO EVERYONE MIGRANT AND CITIZEN ALIKE
THE QUESTION THAT KEEPS COMING BACK TO ME IS
THE FULL PICTURE OF LIFE IN BRITAIN TELL YOUR STORY
IS A REFRAIN OF THE FAR RIGHT
THAT PHRASE IS LOADED WITH HISTORICAL RESONANCE AND PAINFUL MEMORIES OF OVERT AND
THREATENING RACISM FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY
THOSE VANS ELECTRIFIED ME
THEY PROMPTED ME
TO WANT TO SPEAK UP ABOUT THE MESSAGE THEY SENT NOT JUST TO MIGRANTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS BUT
ALSO
AND ACTUALLY
I TALK ABOUT THE VANS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO
EMBLEMATIC SO OBVIOUS
BUT THE TRUTH IS THEY ARE JUST A SMALL
BUT VERY VISIBLE PART OF A LARGER CAMPAIGN TO MAKE THE UK A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR MIGRANTS
MIGRANT WITH NO TIES TO ANYTHING OR ANYONE NO CONSCIENCE OUT TO TAKE YOUR JOBS AND YOUR BENEFITS PREFERABLY AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS AMAZING
THE TRUTH IS WE ALWAYS DIVIDED INTO ALL THESE CATEGORIES BUT WE NOT SO DIFFERENT
UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS MEMBERS OF THE NHS INTO BORDER AGENTS DE FACTO BORDER AGENTS FOR THE BORDER AGENCY
I AM PROUD TO BE MALAWIAN AND BRITISH AND A MIGRANT THAT MINORITY THAT I SPOKE OF EARLIER THAT WOULD WELCOME MOVES TO ENCOURAGE IMMIGRANTS TO LEAVE THIS COUNTRY THEY ARE STILL A MINORITY
DRIVEN AROUND ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE CITIES IN THE UK PUT THERE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY PAID FOR BY TAX PAYERS MONEY
WE ARE MISSING FROM THIS IMMIGRATION DEBATE AND IN OUR ABSENCE CARICATURES ESPECIALLY IN THE MEDIA ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE
FACT THE ARTICLE WAS ABOUT A REPORT FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WHICH REVEALED THAT OUT OF 28 EU MEMBER STATES BRITAIN HAD ISSUED ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE NEW PASSPORTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO MIGRANTS IN 2012
IT MOST OF THEM ARE BRITISH
CHILDREN OF PEOPLE LIKE ME
WHEN DO WE GET TO BELONG
THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS AT THE FOREFRONT OF MY MIND AT MY CITIZENSHIP CEREMONY
I MUST ADMIT WHEN I FIRST WENT TO MY CEREMONY I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO EXPECT
BUT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLY MOVING
I STOOD IN MY TOWN HALL SURROUNDED BY
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE
THEY WERE ALLEGEDLY THERE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE WITHOUT PERMISSION TO RETURN HOME THEY WERE ALSO DRIVEN AROUND SOME OF THE
VOICE OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF NEW BRITISH CITIZENS NEW EUROPEANS
THERE IS ONE THING THAT I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IT WOULD BE TO SPEAK UP
UP AND TO MIGRANTS LIKE ME WHO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TELL THEIR STORY PERHAPS EVEN SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE SILENCED OR LESS FREE TO TELL THEIRS SPEAK UP
INSTEAD OF PERHAPS LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT IT IS QUITE AMAZING THAT WE CAN WELCOME SO MANY PEOPLE INTO THIS BROAD TENT TO BEING BRITISH
INSTEAD
IT LOOKED AT HOW THOSE FIGURES I QUOTED
ARE THREAT
TO THE MAINSTREAM POLITICAL PARTIES AS THEY MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THE UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY
FELT THAT GAVE ME LICENSE TO SPEAK UP I WAS A RESIDENT THOUGH NOT A CITIZEN YET THAT STEP WOULD HAPPEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
SAID SOMETHING SHITTY TO YOU AND THEN SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY WONDERING WHY YOU REACTED THAT WAY YES
IN REAL LIFE HAVE YOU EVER MISPLACED YOUR TED BADGE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY STARTED IMAGINING WHAT A THREE DAY VANCOUVER VACATION MIGHT LOOK
IN REAL LIFE AND THEN FOUND YOURSELF LOOKING FOR AN UNDO BUTTON
EVER WOKEN UP BLISSFULLY AND SUDDENLY BEEN FLOODED BY THE AWFUL REMEMBRANCE THAT SOMEONE HAD LEFT YOU
AN IDIOT WHILE TEXTING WITH SOMEONE HAVE YOU EVER SUBSEQUENTLY TEXTED THAT PERSON THE
HAVE YOU EVER ENDED A TEXT WITH A PERIOD AS A SIGN OF AGGRESSION OKAY
SOMEONE ELSE'S PASSWORD SO MANY TIMES THAT IT LOCKED THEIR ACCOUNT
LONGER WAS IN YOUR LIFE HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED BACK ON THAT EVENT WITH THE SAD SMILE OF
A PAIR OF PANTS AND THEN MUCH LATER REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A LOOSE SOCK SMUSHED UP AGAINST YOUR THIGH {LG} GOOD
A RESULT I NOW HAVE THIS HALF GERMAN BRAIN WITH ALL THE ANALYTICAL THINKING AND THAT SLIGHTLY DORKY DEMEANOR THAT COME WITH THAT
AROUND EMITTING ULTRASONIC SQUEAKS LIKE BATS WE JUST DON'T DO THAT
DUBLIN TRANSPORT HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AND AFTER I FINISHED THE PROJECT THEY GOT A GOOD BIT
DISCOVER THAT THE TWO SPOTS WERE ACTUALLY ONLY A SINGLE BUILDING APART NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I FIND THIS WORMHOLE OR THIS INTER DIMENSIONAL PORTAL
OF COURSE MAKES FOR SOME FUNNY MOMENTS WHEN YOU'RE IN SOME OLD CITY LAYOUT THAT FOLLOWS SOME SORT OF CIRCULAR CITY LOGIC YEAH MAYBE YOU'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL LET'S SAY YOU'RE ON SOME SPOT ON A SIDE
SO I TRIED TO MAKE SENSE AND WHEN I ARRIVED I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME INFORMATION LEAFLETS THAT WOULD HELP ME CRACK THIS SYSTEM AND UNDERSTAND IT AND I FOUND THOSE BROCHURES
HAPPY TO SEE THAT MY FOLKS IN GERMANY AND GREECE FINALLY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING
MAP OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT
IT'S ESSENTIALLY THIS VIRTUAL MAP THAT ONLY EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN
ALL ANIMAL SPECIES DO IT EVEN THOUGH WE ALL USE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TOOLS
US HUMANS OF COURSE WE DON'T
MOVE AROUND MARKING OUR TERRITORY BY SCENT LIKE
{LG} SO WE MOVE ALONG LINEAR ROUTES AND OUR MIND STRAIGHTENS STREETS AND PERCEIVES TURNS AS 90 DEGREE ANGLES THE SECOND THING THAT WE DO TO MAKE A PLACE OUR
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE JUST DRAWN
YOU REALIZE
IT DOES NOT
RESEMBLE A STREET MAP
IF YOU WERE TO PUT AN ACTUAL STREET MAP ON TOP OF WHAT YOU'VE JUST DRAWN
YOU'D REALIZE YOUR STREETS
AND THE DISTANCES THEY'D BE WAY OFF
NO WHAT YOU'VE JUST DRAWN
IS MORE LIKE A DIAGRAM
OR A SCHEMATIC
IT'S A VISUAL CONSTRUCT OF LINES DOTS LETTERS
DESIGNED IN THE LANGUAGE OF OUR BRAINS
THE CORRIDORS WIDENING THE STREETS WHERE THERE WERE LOADS OF BUSES AND MAKING THE STREETS AT STRAIGHT 90 DEGREE CORNERS 45 DEGREE CORNERS OR FRACTIONS OF THAT
THEM INTO SYMBOLS AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALL CAPABLE
AND YOU ASK AN OLD LADY FOR DIRECTIONS BRACE YOURSELF FOR SOME ELABORATE IRISH STORYTELLING ABOUT ALL THE LANDMARKS YEAH SHE'LL TELL YOU THE PUB WHERE HER
CITY PLANNER
IT WAS DESIGNED
BY AN ENGINEERING DRAFTSMAN
IN THE 1930S HARRY BECK
APPLIED THE PRINCIPLES OF SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM DESIGN
AND CHANGED THE WAY PUBLIC TRANSPORT MAPS ARE DESIGNED FOREVER
NOW THE VERY KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS MAP
IS IN THE OMISSION OF LESS IMPORTANT INFORMATION
AND IN THE EXTREME SIMPLIFICATION
SO STRAIGHTENED STREETS
CORNERS OF 90 AND 45 DEGREES BUT
ALSO THE EXTREME GEOGRAPHIC
DISTORTION IN THAT MAP
IF YOU WERE TO LOOK
IMPORTANT THINGS TO MAKE A PLACE OUR OWN FIRST WE MOVE ALONG LINEAR ROUTES
THE OUTCOME OF MY ACADEMIC RESEARCH LOADS OF QUESTIONNAIRES CASE STUDIES AND LOOKING AT A LOT OF MAPS
SO FOR A SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC TRANSPORT MAP WE SHOULD NOT STICK TO ACCURATE REPRESENTATION BUT DESIGN THEM IN THE WAY OUR BRAINS
ALTHOUGH A NIGHT IN THE TEMPLE BAR DISTRICT CAN GET PRETTY WILD {LG} NO
AND BEING HALF GERMAN
I DECIDED ARIS WHY DON'T YOU BUILD YOUR OWN MAP
SO THAT'S WHAT I DID
I RESEARCHED HOW EACH AND EVERY BUS ROUTE MOVED THROUGH THE CITY
NICE AND LOGICAL EVERY BUS ROUTE A SEPARATE LINE
IMPORTANT IS
WITH SIMPLIFIED NETWORK LIKE THIS
IT NOW WOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR ME
TO TACKLE THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE
AND MAKE A PUBLIC TRANSPORT MAP FOR THE CITY CENTER
ONE WHERE I WOULDN'T JUST SHOW RAPID TRANSPORT CONNECTIONS
BUT ALSO ALL THE LOCAL BUS ROUTES STREETS AND THE LIKES AND THIS
IS I ORGANIZE INFORMATION I'M A GRAPHIC DESIGNER PROFESSIONALLY I TRY TO MAKE SENSE OFTEN OF THINGS THAT DON'T MAKE MUCH SENSE THEMSELVES
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE YEAH THEY'RE LITTLE PIECES OF STRING THAT WRAP THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CITY CENTER OR THROUGH THE CITY IF YOU WILL THE GREEK GUY INSIDE OF
BEEN A BUS WE PUT A BUS BACK IN ONLY NOW THESE BUSES WOULDN'T RUN ALL THE WAY TO THE CITY CENTER BUT CONNECT TO THE NEAREST RAPID TRANSPORT MODE ONE OF THESE THICK LINES OVER THERE
SO WE FILL OUR COGNITIVE MAPS WITH THESE MARKERS OF MEANING WHAT'S
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AT DIT AND TOGETHER WE DRAFTED THE SIMPLIFIED MODEL NETWORK WHICH I COULD THEN GO AHEAD AND VISUALIZE
VEHICLES
THEY WOULD GET EXCLUSIVE ROAD USE WHERE POSSIBLE AND IT WOULD BE HIGH QUANTITY HIGH QUALITY TRANSPORT JAMES WANTED TO USE BUS RAPID TRANSPORT FOR THAT RATHER THAN LIGHT RAIL FOR ME IT WAS IMPORTANT
THAT THE VEHICLES THAT WOULD RUN ON THOSE RAPID TRANSPORT CORRIDORS
WOULD BE VISIBLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM LOCAL BUSES ON THE STREET
UP ON A DUBLIN FERRY PORT ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO A PROFESSIONAL FOREIGNER IF YOU LIKE AND I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HAD THIS EXPERIENCE BEFORE
TRANSPORT ROUTE AND IN YOUR MIND THIS ROUTE IS PERCEIVED AS A STRAIGHT LINE AND LIKE PEARL NECKLACE
BIG SURPRISE THAT THE BIG INFORMATION DESIGN ICON OF THE LAST CENTURY
IT TRIES TO BE THE BEST BALANCE BETWEEN ACTUAL REPRESENTATION
AND
SIMPLIFICATION
THE LANGUAGE OF WAY FINDING IN OUR BRAIN
SO STRAIGHTENED LINES
CLEANED UP CORNERS
AND OF COURSE THAT VERY VERY IMPORTANT GEOGRAPHIC DISTORTION THAT MAKES PUBLIC TRANSPORT MAPS POSSIBLE
THINK THIS IS THE CRUCIAL STEP TO UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORK ON A PHYSICAL LEVEL BUT IT'S ALSO THE CRUCIAL STEP TO MAKE A PUBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORK MAPPABLE ON A VISUAL LEVEL SO I TEAMED UP
SAY AS A PUBLIC TRANSPORT MAP THIS DIAGRAM IS AN UTTER FAILURE
OUR MIND KEEPS IT PRETTY SIMPLE YEAH EVERY STREET IS GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS A STRAIGHT LINE AND WE KIND OF IGNORE THE LITTLE TWISTS AND TURNS THAT THE STREETS MAKE
THAT WE UNDERTAKE FROM DAY TO DAY ARE WITHIN A CITY AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW THE CITY GETTING FROM A TO B MAY SEEM PRETTY OBVIOUS RIGHT BUT THE QUESTION IS
NOW WE COULD TAKE OUT ALL THE LOCAL BUSES THAT RAN ALONGSIDE THOSE RAPID TRANSPORT MEANS
HE WAS CORRECT HIS WIFE IS GETTING SKEPTICAL AT THIS POINT WE KEEP GOING RED
RED BLACK BLACK RED AND HE'S GETTING ALL OF THEM RIGHT RED BLACK RED FASTER BLACK BLACK BLACK RED THROUGH THE WHOLE DECK BLACK BLACK RED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM RIGHT AND AT THE END ED IS LAUGHING HE'S HOWLING THE WHOLE RESTAURANT IS STARING AT US AND I TURN TO SEE
HIS WIFE AND
SHE IS WEEPING
TEARS OF JOY
IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MAGIC I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED
A LITTLE BIT LATER I AM GOING TO TELL YOU HOW WE DID IT
NONE OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BEFORE SO OF COURSE THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES HOW HOW DO YOU DO IT HOW DO YOU DO PERSPECTIVE TAKING WELL FIRST YOU NEED TO
YOU SEE OUR WORLD IS A SHARED EXPERIENCE FRACTURED BY INDIVIDUAL PERSPECTIVES IMAGINE IF WE COULD ALL FEEL UNDERSTOOD
BLIND HE SAID YES TO ME THAT WAS CRUCIAL RELEVANT INFORMATION
LIKE IT WILL BE RUDE OR SOMEHOW THEY WON'T WANT TO ANSWER BUT WE UNDERESTIMATE PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO ANSWER OUR
OR A TRICK OR EVEN THE SECRET MAGIC IS ABOUT CONNECTING LIFE IS
WE'RE ACTUALLY ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED OH THANK YOU
IT SEEMS THAT A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SEE WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAD THEIR SIGHT AND THEN LOST IT TO ACCIDENT OR ILLNESS WITH ED I CANNOT EVEN USE THE LANGUAGE OF SIGHT
SAY OUR THING WE'VE ALL DONE IT WE'RE ALL GUILTY BUT I DID THIS ESPECIALLY BADLY AND I THINK TO THE DETRIMENTS OF MY
ONLY WITH THE INTENTION OF COMING UP WITH SOMETHING CLEVER TO SAY SO AS SOON AS THEIR LIPS STOP WE
TO LEARN THIS IT'S IMPORTANT NOT SIMPLY TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT TO LISTEN TO THE ANSWERS AND LISTEN TO UNDERSTAND DON'T JUST LISTEN TO RESPOND OR TO REPLY AND YOU'VE HEARD IT BEFORE
YOU CAN START TO LEARN THIS TECHNIQUE ASK QUESTIONS LISTEN TO UNDERSTAND THE ANSWERS WHEN YOU DO THAT I
BY ANYBODY AT ANYTIME SO I DIDN'T ED WANT TO FEEL TRICKED I WANTED HIM TO FEEL MAGIC I WANTED HIM TO
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VISUAL PERSPECTIVE AND EMOTIONAL
I SAID ED HIS NAME WAS ED DO YOU TRUST YOUR WIFE {LG} THEN I SAID WILL YOU TRUST HER NOW AND HE SAID SURE SO I TOOK OUT A PACK OF CARDS GAVE THEM TO HER AND SAID MIX THE CARDS MAKE SURE THERE'S NO SPECIAL MARKINGS ON THEM AND SHE SAID NO THEY'RE FINE
WRONG MOST IN MY LIFE I THINK YOU'VE HEARD TO BEFORE AND WE'RE ALL
IN MY LIFE
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS INVESTED IN THEM
NOW THAT WASN'T TRUE
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO CARE ABOUT SOMEBODY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THEM
THEY HAVE TO FEEL UNDERSTOOD
THEY HAVE TO FEEL CARED ABOUT
AND I WASN'T DOING THAT
ON TOP OF HIS
THEN I GAVE HIM THESE INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU THINK THE CARD IS A RED CARD AND I PUSHED MY FOOT DOWN ON HIS ONCE
THEN YOU SAY RED IF YOU THINK IT'S A BLACK CARD AND I PUSHED MY FOOT DOWN ON HIS TWICE
THEN YOU SAY BLACK
I WAS TEACHING ED A SECRET SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATION WHERE I WOULD LET HIM KNOW WHAT COLOR THE CARD WAS BY THE FOOT TAPS ONCE FOR RED
TWICE FOR BLACK
HAVE YOU EVER ASKED FOR SOMEBODY'S NAME AND INSTANTLY FORGOTTEN IT WHY DO WE FORGET PEOPLE'S NAMES BECAUSE WHILE THEY'RE TELLING US THEIR NAME WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO SAY OURS FIRST NAME LAST NAME MR MILLER BRIAN WE'RE NOT LISTENING WE'RE ON
MAKE BETTER MORE MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY
IT DRASTICALLY IMPROVED MY LIFE AND I REALLY BELIEVE IT CAN IMPROVE YOURS
SO
ED
HOW DID ED
A BLIND MAN SEE THE CARDS
THE
WANTED HER TO SEE HIM IN THAT LIGHT AND FOR THEM TO SHARE IN THAT EXPERIENCE TOGETHER
BUT I ALWAYS STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN THEM EVENTUALLY THE COMMUNICATION WOULD BREAK DOWN PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE AND I WOULD BE ALONE IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO ADMIT IT BUT IT WAS MY FAULT OR AT LEAST
NO I NOT EVEN ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT SOCIAL MOVEMENTS WERE THIS WONDERFUL CATALYST FOR CHANGE IN THE WORLD
I BLITHELY WALKED THROUGH MY TWENTIES ENTERING CORPORATE DOORS THAT HAD BEEN KNOCKED OPENED BY THE BLACK FREEDOM MOVEMENT AND FEMINIST MOVEMENT THAT PRECEDED ME
AND WHILE I DID THAT SO EASILY I DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND MY OWN HISTORY
AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE MOVEMENTS HAD SHAPED MY CHOICES AND THE CHOICES OF AN ENTIRE GENERATION
AND THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY PARENTS' STORY
I HAD TO LEARN MY PARENTS' STORY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THESE MOVEMENTS HAD SHAPED MY LIFE
AND HAD SHAPED MY CHOICES
SO AS I PULLED TOGETHER THE FRAGMENTS OF MY LIFE I LEARNED A FEW THINGS ABOUT SOCIAL MOVEMENTS THAT I'LL LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU MOVEMENTS ARE MESSY ITERATIVE AND INNOVATED THEY
THREE POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR THAT CONCRETE ACTION SOMETHING TO DO THAT WILL TAKE YOU FORWARD USE YOUR CONSUMER POWER TELL
ASK YOU TO JOIN THEM
AND YOU'D SAY WELL HOW CAN I DO THAT
WHAT'S THE EASIEST WAY IN
THE FIRST THING IS TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT BREAKS YOUR HEART
OR CONVERSELY WHAT PISSES YOU OFF
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE SAME COIN
BECAUSE WHAT PISSES YOU OFF IS OFTEN WHAT IS BREAKING YOUR HEART
THE SECOND THING YOU CAN DO IS FIND YOUR TRIBE
ONCE YOU'VE FIGURED OUT WHAT BREAKS YOUR
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR CHOICES HAD SHAPED MINE SO I HAD TO TAKE A BIT OF A JOURNEY IT STARTED WITH THE BABY BOOK AND IT STARTED WITH TALKING TO FRIENDS
PART OF THE MOVEMENT THIS IS SARU JAYARAMAN SHE IS THE FOUNDER OF ROCUNITED ORG AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE PRIME MOVERS FELLOWS ROCUNITED WORKS WITH RESTAURANT WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
ALABAMA IN THE 60S TO THE PEOPLE'S CLIMATE CHANGE MARCH IN NEW YORK {NS} {NS} AND GLOBALLY TO
TELLING YOUR STORY HELPS BEING A PART OF THE COLLECTIVE AND INFORM THOSE WHO MIGHT SHAPE THE EDUCATION AND REFORM MOVEMENT FINALLY USE YOUR FEET FROM
HOW WELL THEY ARE PERFORMING ON TAKING THE HIGH ROAD AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES IT'S AN EASY STEP TO START TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS MOVEMENT
BUILDING
NEXT MAKE A COMMITMENT
YOU HAVE TO COMMIT FOR THE LONG HAUL
BIG CHANGE MANY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFETIME
BUT YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE BIG THINGS THROUGH YOUR LIFE
I THINK ABOUT MY PARENTS RADICAL ACT TO GET MARRIED ACROSS RACE AND THE CLASS LINES IN THE LATE 1950S
AND I KNOW THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE
CHART A COURSE FOR THAT WHICH WE CAN NOT YET IMAGINE IN OUR DAY TO DAY WORLD AND FINALLY
LEADERSHIP EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US WHO PARTICIPATES IN A SOCIAL MOVEMENT IS DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP BUT THEY ALSO REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN SET A VISION
I AM ASKING YOU TO CHANGE THE WORLD
BUT I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO DO IT ALONE
I'M ASKING YOU TO DO IT BY JOINING A SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT
SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS ARE SUSTAINED COLLECTIVE ACTIONS TO CHALLENGE INJUSTICE IN
OR A YOUNG PERSON DESCRIBING THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR SCHOOL AND THEN FINISHING THE SENTENCE I DREAM A SCHOOL
ONE YOUNG WOMAN WHO'S ON THE SITE ALREADY SPENT TWO YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL AS A HOMELESS GIRL
SHE DESCRIBES LIVING OUT IN HER CAR TRYING TO GET TO SCHOOL ON TIME AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO HER HOMEWORK
AT THE END SHE SAYS I DREAM SCHOOL THAT DID NOT ONLY PROVIDE ACADEMIC SUPPORT
MATTERS UNFORTUNATELY MY PARENTS BOTH DIED YOUNG MY FATHER DIED WHEN I WAS SIX AND MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS 27 AND I HADN'T HAD THE SENSE TO ASK THEM ABOUT
IS A KEY OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW COLLECTIVE POWER
BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT AS YOU MARCH ON THE STREET AS PART OF A SWATH OF HUMANITY WHO SHARES THE SAME VALUES THAT YOU DO YOU FEEL YOURSELF EMPOWERED AND TRANSFORMED
IT IS A BOTH A CLASSIC AND CURRENT
HAVE CARRIED IT FORWARD FROM MY PARENTS
AS WE THINK ABOUT THESE MOMENTS I REALLY AM ASKING YOU TO CHANGE THE WORLD
AND IN SO DOING TO MEND POTENTIALLY YOUR OWN BROKEN HEART
TO JOIN A SOCIAL MOVEMENT THAT IS WORKING TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETY FOR US ALL
AND IN SO DOING TRANSFORM YOURSELF FROM AN INDIVIDUAL FRAGMENT TO A CONTRIBUTING FORCE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE
AND IN ALL CASES YOU CAN FIND YOUR WAY IN
IT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY
BUT AS YOU JOIN IN A WORK TO CHANGE THE WORLD YOU MAY FIND LIKE I DID
THAT YOU YOURSELF WILL BE CHANGED
YOU'LL BE TRANSFORMED INTO A BIGGER VERSION OF YOURSELF ONE THAT STRETCHES BACKWARDS THROUGH GENERATIONS WHO BENT THE ARCH OF HISTORY TOWARD JUSTICE INTO TODAY
AND REACHES FORWARD TO SHAPING THE FUTURE
THANK YOU
ASK MORE OF YOU NOT LESS THEY ARE NOT MARKETING GIMMICK THAT ASKS YOU TO
STORY
MY MOTHER WAS THE OLDEST DAUGHTER OF A
PROMINENT SURGEON IN MICHIGAN CITY INDIANA
AND MY FATHER WAS THE OLDEST SON OF WASHING MACHINE FACTORY WORKERS FROM CONNERSVILLE INDIANA
THEY BOTH ATTENDED BALL STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE IN THE LATE 1950S
AND INDEPENDENTLY THEY BOTH CHOSE TO ATTEND A LUTHERAN CAMP PROMOTING INTERRACIAL HARMONY THAT WAS PART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT WAS FOMENTING AT THAT TIME
THEY MET THERE
AND THEY FELL IN LOVE
AND
INTERSECTIONS OF THE WORLD COME TO MIND LIKE THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE IN PARIS OR TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YORK CITY BOTH BUSTLING WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF A SEEMINGLY ENDLESS
AN ASTROPHYSICIST
I STUDY BLAZARS SUPERMASSIVE HYPERACTIVE BLACK HOLES THAT SIT AT THE CENTERS OF MASSIVE GALAXIES AND SHOOT OUT JETS NEARBY THOSE BLACK HOLES AT SPEEDS APPROACHING THE SPEED OF LIGHT
IN A PROCESS WE ARE STILL TRYING TO COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
I HAVE DREAMED OF BECOMING AN ASTROPHYSICIST SINCE I WAS
THIS YEAR FOR LANDING A ROVER ON COMET AND THE 1 5 BILLION DOLLAR GALILEO MISSION TO JUPITER TWO HIGH PROFILE SCIENTIFIC VICTORIES FOR NASA THE UNITED
IT WAS A POSTER THAT SAVED MY DREAM
AND SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND PROGRAMS
THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL POSTER ENCOURAGING STUDENTS OF COLOR TO BECOME PHYSICISTS
IT WAS STRIKING TO ME BECAUSE IT FEATURED A
PROVIDED ME WITH FULL FUNDING AND I WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE MY BACHELOR'S IN PHYSICS AFTER GRADUATION AND DESPITE KNOWING THAT I WANTED A PHD IN ASTROPHYSICS I
EVEN IMAGINE SECONDLY AMONG THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES OF OUR TIME MOST NOW FIND THEIR INTERSECTION WITH STEM WE HAVE AS A GLOBAL SOCIETY SOLVED MOST OF THE
PLENTY
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
I AM BOTH BLACK AND A WOMAN
LIKE THE BIRTH OF STARS IN THE HEAVENLIES THIS ROBUST COMBINATION OF KNOWING RESULTS IN A SHINING EXAMPLE OF THE EXPLOSIVE FUSION OF IDENTITIES
WROTE TO THE SOCIETY AND REQUESTED MY PERSONAL COPY OF THE POSTER WHICH TO THIS DAY STILL HANGS
ME IN MY PLACE WHILE THERE WAS CERTAINLY THE ACUTE PAIN OF THE ENCOUNTER THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT MY APPEARANCE CAN TELL ANYONE ANYTHING ABOUT MY ABILITY
UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE AND UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEMS THAT MAKE THIS WORLD THE REASON I TELL MY STORY AND THE STORY OF DR ALEXANDER AND JESSICA MATTHEWS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE 60 WOMEN OF COLOR INTERVIEWED IN A RECENT STUDY BY JOAN C WILLIAMS AT UC HASTINGS REPORTED FACING RACIALIZED GENDER BIAS INCLUDING BEING MISTAKEN FOR THE JANITORIAL STAFF
THIS MISTAKEN IDENTITY WAS NOT
AFTER TWO YEARS OUT OF SCHOOL THEY ACCEPTED ME INTO THE PROGRAM AND I FOUND MYSELF AGAIN ON THE PATH TO THE PHD AFTER RECEIVING MY MASTER'S AT FISK I WENT ON TO YALE TO COMPLETE MY PHD ONCE I WAS
CONSIDERING THE LIMINAL SPACE BETWEEN DISCIPLINES SCIENCE THE PURSUIT OF UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICAL WORLD BY WAY OF CHEMISTRY PHYSICS BIOLOGY CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE
THE EXHILARATION OF VICTORIOUS BREAKTHROUGHS AND SOMETIMES THE EXPLOSIVE PAIN OF REGENERATION
THIS COLLABORATION THIS BRINGING TOGETHER OF THE LIMINAL
THE DIFFERENTLY LIVED
DISTINCTLY EXPERIENCED AND DISPARATELY IMPACTED
SIMPLY PUT
WE CANNOT BE THE MOST EXCELLENT EXPRESSION OF OUR COLLECTIVE GENIUS
WITHOUT THE FULL MEASURE OF HUMANITY BROUGHT TO BEAR
THANK YOU
THAT THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO GRADUATE WITH A PHD IN AN ASTRONOMY RELATED FIELD DID SO JUST ONE YEAR BEFORE MY BIRTH
AS I JOURNEYED ALONG MY PATH I ENCOUNTERED THE BEST AND WORST OF LIFE AT AN INTERSECTION
THE TECHNICAL ABILITY TO SPEARHEAD SOME OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS SPACE MISSIONS OF OUR TIME AND SHE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD HER PLACE OF BEING EXACTLY WHO SHE WAS
GREAT THINGS HAPPEN AT INTERSECTIONS
IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE THAT SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE OCCUR AT THE INTERSECTIONS
IN THE LIMINAL SPACE WHERE BY LIMINAL I MEAN THE SPACE IN BETWEEN
EXPANDED TO THE MANY INTERSECTIONAL PEOPLE WHOSE EXPERIENCES POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ENRICH THE CONVERSATIONS IN WAYS THAT OUTMATCH EVEN THE BEST RESOURCED HOMOGENOUS GROUPS THIS IS NOT A
WAS OSTRACIZED BY MANY OF MY CLASSMATES ONE OF WHOM WENT SO FAR AS TO INVITE ME TO DO WHAT I REALLY CAME HERE TO DO AS HE PUSHED ALL THE DIRTY DISHES FROM OUR MEAL IN FRONT OF ME TO CLEAN
WE CAN ALL THINK OF INTERSECTIONS THAT HAVE SPECIAL MEANING TO US TO BE INTERSECTIONAL THEN IS TO OCCUPY A POSITION AT AN INTERSECTION I'VE LIVED THE ENTIRETY OF MY
TO SAY DIRECTLY TO EVERY BLACK LATINA INDIGENOUS FIRST NATION OR ANY OTHER WOMAN OR GIRL WHO FINDS HERSELF RESTING AT THE BLESSED INTERSECTION OF RACE AND GENDER
THAT YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE
MY PERSONAL HOPE IS THAT YOU'LL BECOME AN
THAT'S WHY TODAY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WOMEN OF COLOR IN STEM WHO ARE INEXORABLY UNAPOLOGETICALLY LIVING AS THE
THINGS LIKE EDUCATIONAL INEQUITIES POLICE BRUTALITY HIV AIDS CLIMATE CHANGE GENETIC EDITING
CRITICAL ROLE OF ROSETTA STONE DECODING AND ENCODING THE PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD STEM IS UTTERLY INCOMPLETE
JUST AFTER MY FATHER'S DEPARTURE FROM OUR LIVES THIS THRUST MY MOTHER MY SISTER AND I OUT OF THE RELATIVE COMFORT OF MIDDLE CLASS LIFE AND INTO THE ALMOST CONSTANT STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET
AND THE ONGOING STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE
BEYOND THE PHYSICAL LANDSCAPE OF OUR PLANET SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS CELESTIAL IMAGES ARE OF INTERSECTIONS
STARS ARE BORN AT THE MESSY INTERSECTION OF GAS AND DUST INSTIGATED BY GRAVITY'S IRREVOCABLE PULL
LITTLE ABOUT AND TREATED WITH SUCH DISREGARD AND IMAGINE IF THROUGH NEW SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES WE WERE JUST BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND ITS IMPORTANCE TO HOW
OTHER DRUGS WILL WORK FOR YOUR HEART CONDITION AND IF YOU'RE A
THAN IF THEY DON'T GET ANTIBIOTICS THEN OR ONLY GET THEM LATER AND SO WHAT WE DO EARLY ON MAY HAVE PROFOUND IMPACTS ON THE GUT MICROBIAL COMMUNITY AND ON LATER HEALTH THAT WE'RE ONLY BEGINNING TO
TO SAY THAT TWO PEOPLE LOOK BASICALLY THE SAME IN THE SAME BODY HABITAT EITHER SO YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME IN TERMS OF OUR HUMAN DNA
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS FOUND OUT THAT THE MICROBES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY ARE AMAZINGLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER SO IF I LOOK AT
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE OF YOUR GUT MICROBES YOU MIGHT ONLY SHARE 10 PERCENT SIMILARITY WITH THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR GUT MICROBES SO THAT'S AS DIFFERENT AS THE
COME FROM IN THE FIRST PLACE WELL IF AS I DO YOU HAVE DOGS OR KIDS YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME DARK SUSPICIONS
OBESITY OBESITY HAS A REALLY LARGE EFFECT AS IT TURNS OUT AND TODAY WE CAN TELL WHETHER YOU'RE LEAN OR OBESE WITH 90 PERCENT ACCURACY BY LOOKING AT THE MICROBES IN YOUR GUT NOW ALTHOUGH THAT MIGHT SOUND IMPRESSIVE IN SOME
SHOWED IN A STUDY A FEW YEARS AGO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY MATCH THE PALM OF SOMEONE'S HAND UP TO THE COMPUTER MOUSE THAT THEY USE
IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISEASES METABOLIZING DRUGS AND SO FORTH SO HOW DO THEY DO ALL
THAT ARE DELIVERED BY C SECTION ALL OF THEIR MICROBES INSTEAD LOOK LIKE SKIN AND THIS MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH
THE MICROBES ESSENTIALLY LOOK THE SAME UNDER A MICROSCOPE SO INSTEAD OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY THEM VISUALLY WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK AT THEIR
MICROBES ARE ACTUALLY AFFECTING THEIR BEHAVIOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE EATING MORE THAN THE NORMAL MOUSE SO THEY ONLY GET FAT IF WE LET THEM EAT AS MUCH
GPS WHERE WE DON'T JUST KNOW WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY BUT ALSO WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND WHAT
SO MICROBES ARE PERFORMING A HUGE RANGE OF FUNCTIONS THEY HELP US DIGEST OUR FOOD THEY HELP EDUCATE OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM THEY HELP US RESIST DISEASE AND THEY MAY EVEN BE AFFECTING OUR BEHAVIOR
RESISTANT BACTERIA WHICH VERY IMPORTANT THEY MAY ALSO BE DEGRADING OUR GUT MICROBIAL ECOSYSTEMS AND SO ONE DAY WE MAY COME TO REGARD ANTIBIOTICS WITH THE SAME HORROR THAT WE CURRENTLY RESERVE FOR THOSE METAL TOOLS THAT THE EGYPTIANS USED TO USE TO MUSH UP THE BRAINS BEFORE THEY DRAINED THEM OUT FOR
CAN ACTUALLY CURE DISEASE THIS IS ONE OF THE NEWEST THINGS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO VISUALIZE WITH COLLEAGUES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR BODIES BUT WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN THAT GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHAT'S
HOW CAN WE TELL WHETHER THESE MICROBIAL DIFFERENCES THAT CORRELATE WITH DISEASE ARE CAUSE OR EFFECT WELL ONE THING WE CAN
CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN WE DO TOURS OF OUR LAB AT THE BIOFRONTIERS INSTITUTE AND WE EXPLAIN THAT WE USE ROBOTS AND LASERS TO
POUNDS OF THOSE MICROBES IN OUR GUT THEY REALLY OUTNUMBER US AND SO HOW MUCH DO THEY OUTNUMBER US WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK OF AS OUR BODIES IS IT OUR
PEANUT BUTTER BASED SUPPLEMENT THAT IS USED FOR THE CHILDREN IN THE CLINIC AND THE MICE THAT
THIS IS TRULY AMAZING BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN PILOT THERAPIES BY TRYING THEM OUT IN WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MICE WITH INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE'S GUT COMMUNITIES AND PERHAPS TAILOR THOSE THERAPIES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL
EXPERIENCE OUT CAMPING IS ACTUALLY TRUE FOR EXAMPLE I SELDOM GET BITTEN BY
REALLY DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER THIS HAS HAD AN EFFECT ON HER HEALTH SPECIFICALLY RIGHT WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF JUST ONE CHILD NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE
ARE RELATIVELY STABLE SO EVEN IF YOU LIVE TOGETHER WITH SOMEONE YOU'LL MAINTAIN YOUR SEPARATE MICROBIAL IDENTITY OVER A PERIOD OF
SO WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DISCOVERY WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT THAT MICROBES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR ALL THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISEASES RANGING FROM INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE TO
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHETHER WE CAN ALSO DO THIS SORT OF THING ACROSS SPECIES AND IT TURNS OUT
SINGLE GENE IN YOUR GENOME AND THEN IN MICE WE CAN DO A LOT MORE SO
OF WHICH HAVE BEEN LINKED TO MICROBES NOW AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT UNTIL RECENTLY EVERY SURVIVING MAMMAL HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY THE BIRTH CANAL AND SO THE LACK OF THOSE PROTECTIVE MICROBES THAT WE'VE CO EVOLVED WITH MIGHT BE
COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW US TO TAKE ALL THESE TERABYTES OF SEQUENCE DATA AND TURN THEM INTO SOMETHING THAT'S A BIT MORE USEFUL AS A MAP AND
THAT MAKE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO WE ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED HOW SOME
AND THEN RELEASE THE RESULTS BACK TO THEM WE ALSO RELEASE THEM DE
TO FREELY ENTER THE ATMOSPHERE
BUT ONCE THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES THE SURFACE
AND PART OF IT IS REFLECTED BACK TO SPACE AS HEAT
GREEN HOUSE GASES TRAP THIS HEAT WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THEY KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE WARM
BUT IT'S A MATTER OF SCALE
A CENTURY OF INDUSTRIALIZATION PROGRESS DEVELOPMENT
HAVE DRIVEN UP THE QUANTITIES OF GREEN HOUSE GASES HIGH ABOVE LIMITS
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE
THE TEMPERATURE IS RISING
SO THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE AND THE CONCENTRATION OF GREEN HOUSE GASES
AND THIS CONNECTION IS CREATING PROBLEMS TO OUR PLANET
BUT WHAT ABOUT IRAQ
HOW IS IRAQ AFFECTED BY THOSE CHANGES
ALTHOUGH THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AMONG THE LOWEST CONTRIBUTORS WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE COMPARED TO CHINA INDIA THE UNITED STATES
THOSE COUNTRIES
THEY WILL SUFFER THE WORST CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE STRUGGLING
FOR WATER SCARCITY
ACCORDING TO THE 2009 IRAQI OIL PRODUCTION
8 MILLION TONS OF CO2 HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE ALMOST THE TOTAL EMISSION OF LEBANON THAT YEAR
WHILE OIL IS A BLESSING FOR A COUNTRY
IT COULD BE A CURSE
SO LET'S START WITH THE RIGHT FOOT WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENT
LET'S SET IRAQ
AS AN EXAMPLE
AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND THE WHOLE MIDDLE EAST
THE BEGINNING BEGINS RIGHT SO THIS IS IT
TODAY YOU CAN TAKE ACTION NOT TOMORROW TOMORROW IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE
TODAY
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACE OF YOUR CHILDREN
ASK YOURSELF
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM
A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN LIVE
OR A PLACE WHERE THEY WILL STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE
I DO CONSIDER EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AS DECISION MAKERS WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
WHETHER YOUR TURN OFF YOUR LIGHT WHEN YOU LEAVE A ROOM OR YOUR SET UP A
TO PROVIDE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS WITH BETTER COUNTRY
A BETTER REGION
BETTER PLANET WHERE TO LIVE
I WORK WITH THOSE PEOPLE I SEE THOSE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND ACTUALLY
THIS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I CAME TO LIVE AND WORK IN IRAQ IN THE FIRST PLACE
TO COOPERATE ALL TOGETHER
MANY TIMES MY FLIGHTS GOT DELAYED OR EVEN CANCELLED BECAUSE OF IT
SO YOU SEE CLIMATE CHANGE IS AFFECTING MY LIFE YOUR LIFE EVERYBODY'S LIVES
AND LET'S FACE IT
CLIMATE CHANGE IS PLAYING A GAME AGAINST THE WORLD
BUT THE WORLD IN A WAY IS FIGHTING BACK
AND WHAT ABOUT IRAQ
IS IRAQ AN ACTIVE PART OF THIS GAME OR NOT
OF COURSE
IRAQ
IS NOW REPORTING THE GREEN HOUSE GASES EMISSION INVENTORY AND IS ALSO SETTING STRATEGIES
IN ORDER TO REDUCE ITS CONTRIBUTION ON GLOBAL WARMING
AS EXPECTED IN EVERY OIL
GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I TOLD HIM BACK THEN
HE CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE FOR HIS PEOPLE AND HIS REGION BY
SETTING EXAMPLES OF GREEN PRACTICES OR RAISING HIS VOICE TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HELP HIM OUT PRESERVING HIS LAND AND HIS PEOPLE
ALL OF YOU CAN DO THE SAME
WITH DIFFERENT ACTIONS AND DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES BUT WITH ONE COMMON GOAL
REDUCE YOUR IMPACT ON THIS
YOU CAN TURN OFF YOUR LIGHT WHEN YOU LEAVE A ROOM
OR YOU CAN USE WISELY THE
HEATER AND AIR CONDITIONING
BY NOT SETTING UP THE TEMPERATURE FOR YOUR ROOM TO 10 DEGREES IN THE SUMMER OR 35 DEGREES IN THE WINTER
FOOD
AND POTABLE WATER
REQUIRE ENERGY TO BE PRODUCED DO NOT WASTE THEM
TAKE CARE TODAY OF THE RESOURCES YOU'VE BEEN PROVIDED WITH
BECAUSE IN DOING SO
YOU WILL NOT JUST HELP IRAQ
REDUCING ITS CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT ALSO
YOU WILL IMPROVE YOUR OWN LIVING CONDITIONS YOUR OWN ENVIRONMENT
THE SHEIKH OF THAT VILLAGE INVITED ME TO HIS PLACE
WE WERE DRINKING CHAI
AND WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS AREA AND HE WAS TELLING ME THAT FOR THE LAST 20 30 YEARS
HIS LOCAL ACTIVITIES MAINLY AGRICULTURE AND SHEEP PASTURE
HAVE BEEN SUFFERING BECAUSE OF WATER SCARCITY
HE WAS ASKING FOR SOME EXPLANATION
AND I TOLD HIM KAKA
ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IS RELATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE
BASICALLY
PEOPLE POLLUTE THE AIR
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE TEMPERATURE RISES
AND THE WATER AVAILABLE FOR YOUR PEOPLE IS LESS
THIS REMARKABLE PERSON THE SHEIKH
HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS PEOPLE HE KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON AROUND THERE
AND HE LOOKED AT ME QUITE SURPRISED
WONDERING IF
THE SMALL GENERATORS THAT THEY WERE USING OR THE OLD CARS THAT THEY WERE RUNNING
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH PROBLEMS
HIS TRUE AND SINCERE CONCERN
ABOUT HIS PEOPLE ABOUT HIS LAND BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS TOTAL AND COMPLETE
UNAWARENESS
OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE THIS AREA
MADE ME REALIZE
FOR ONE SIDE
HOW FAR SOCIETY IS FROM A TOTAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOW MUCH WE CAN DO
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE OUR PLANET
YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHEN YOU WILL TAKE OFF OR LAND AND WHY IS THAT MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE OF A DUST STORM EPISODE HAPPENING IN BAGHDAD BASRAH OR THE KURDISTAN REGION AIRPORT
CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN IRAQ
ACCORDING TO THE DATA FROM A RAINFALL STATION PLACED EAST BAGHDAD
FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN PROGRESSIVELY LESS IN BAGHDAD
BUT THIS TREND
IS NOT JUST FOR BAGHDAD IT'S FOR THE WHOLE IRAQ
ANYBODY HERE KNOWS WHAT THE SHARYEE IS
THE SHARYEE IS SOUTHERN WIND
THAT USUALLY BLOWS LATE APRIL AND LATE SEPTEMBER
THIS WIND
OFTEN COMES WITH VIOLENT DUST STORMS
THOUGH CLIMATE CHANGE
IS NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE GENESIS OF DUST STORMS
THE DRYER THE AIR
THE HIGHER
THE
CLUB AT MY SCHOOL THE CLUB GIVES STUDENTS MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND IDEAS TO GO OUT AND HELP OTHERS AS MUCH AS THEY CAN YOU SEE IT'S NOT JUST GOOD FOR THE BENEFICIARIES IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR OURSELVES
BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE THAT IS HOW I FELL IN LOVE WITH
HELPING
OTHERS EVEN THOUGH HIS SITUATION BROUGHT ME SORROW
KNOWING THAT I COULD HELP HIM THAT FELT GREAT
I COULD HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON HIS LIFE JUST AS HE DID TO MINE
WE ARE
I WAS SERVING WAS SO INCREDIBLY KIND AND WISE THAT WHEN I SAW HE ESSENCIALLY LIVED IN THE
SEEMED LESS IMPORTANT AND EVEN MINISCULE
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE POPULAR AND STRAIGHT A STUDENT OR WHAT RACE OR GENDER YOU ARE
HELPING OTHERS IS SOMETHING ANYONE CAN DO NO
THAT I'M GOING TO SPEND MY TIME AND ENERGY
ON BEING AS KIND GENEROUS AND AS HELPFUL TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS I CAN
HELPING OTHERS
IS SOMETHING YOU ALL CAN DO AND ONCE I STARTED DOING IT
AND EVERYONE HAS LITTLE THINGS THEY DO TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL HAPPIER
I CAN RELATE TO THAT BECAUSE I SHOP
BUT ANOTHER THING I CAN RELATE TO THAT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT
ARE THE OVERWHELMING FEELINGS THAT COME FROM HELPING SOMEONE ELSE
FEELINGS OF JOY AND I BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING WE ALL NEED TO EXPERIENCE
OF FAILURE SELF DOUBT AND OVERALL PRETTY LOW SELF ESTEEM
BUT THE GREAT FEELING OF KNOWING THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO HELP ANOTHER PERSON
THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL GREAT ABOUT YOURSELF AND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE FOUND
ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES I TRULY EXPERIENCED THIS WHEN VOLUNTEERING WAS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD
I WAS HANDING UP FOOD TO THE HOMELESS IN DETROIT
HELPING OTHERS IS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL DO TOGETHER THANK YOU
MORE SKILLED I FELT FURTHER BEHIND AND ALONE
THAT NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF MADE ME FEEL EVEN MORE ISOLATED
NLD IS A NEUROLOGICAL SYNDROME THAT CONSIST OF DEFICIENCIES IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN
SOME INDICATORS ARE
WHO PICK THE FOOD THAT WE EAT
ARE DENIED THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT EVERY OTHER CHILD IN AMERICA ENJOYS TODAY
THEY CAN WORK AT FAR YOUNGER AGES
FOR LONGER HOURS AT EXPLOITATIVE WAGES
AND AT GREATER RISK TO THEIR HEALTH
FEDERAL LAWS PERMIT A CHILD
DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR DREAMS HERE IN HER OWN WORDS IT'S A LITTLE OF WHAT ZULEMA'S LIFE IS LIKE
ARE ALL HAPPY THEY'RE GOING TO GRADUATE FROM 8TH GRADE THEY'RE GOING TO GO TOGETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS PROM AND ALL THIS STUFF
NOT RETURNING UNTIL WEEKS OR MONTHS AFTER SCHOOL RESUMES IN THE FALL AS YOU'LL HEAR IT TAKES A TOLL
CLEARLY SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE AND SINCE I'M A FILM MAKER I MADE FILM
BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE A MIGRANT AND BECAUSE YOU'RE A MIGRANT YOU HAVE TO GO
ARE STILL JUST CHILDREN
AND LIKE PERLA MANY OF THEM HAVE DREAMS
SOME MAY WANT TO BE DOCTORS SOME ENGINEERS SOME POLICE OFFICERS
NONE OF THEM WANT TO REMAIN IN THE FIELDS
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW SO THAT THEY CAN FOLLOW THOSE DREAMS SO THAT THEY CAN FOLLOW THE AMERICAN DREAM
MIGRANT FARM WORKER CHILDREN DROP OUT AT FOUR TIMES THE NATIONAL RATE NOW DESPITE THE UNFAIR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN
TIME GOES AND AS IT GOES IT GOES FASTER GRADES KEEP GOING YOU FAIL YOU FAIL YOU PASS YOU PASS
I'M GOING TO END THIS TALK THIS MORNING
BY HONORING A PROMISE I MADE TO MAR A MOJICA
MAR A MOJICA WAS THE MOTHER OF CHUI MOJICA A 12 YEAR OLD I INTERVIEWED WHILE MAKING THE HARVEST
MY PROMISE TO HER WAS VERY SIMPLE
THAT I WOULD LET PEOPLE LIKE YOU HEAR HER STORY
AND SO THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO HONOR THAT PROMISE AND I'M GOING TO LET MAR A MOJICA
HAVE THE LAST WORD
HE TOLD ME HE WOULDN'T LEAVE THE FIELDS UNLESS HIS PARENTS CAME WITH HIM NOW HIS FAMILY MIGRATED HERE LEGALLY LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE BUT WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE HARVESTS ARE ALWAYS UNCERTAIN AND THE EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDE A CONSTANT DANGER
SO I THINK I'M
PAST 15 YEARS OF HIS CAREER DOCUMENTING CHILD LABOR AND SLAVERY AROUND THE WORLD AMONG MY RECENT PROJECTS WERE STOLEN CHILDHOODS
A DREAM I HAVE A DREAM TO BECOME A LAWYER I HAVE A DREAM TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE STOP BEING MIGRANTS I HAVE I HAVE SO MANY DREAMS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE JUST LIKE ME
FORMS OF CHILD LABOR ALSO DROVE HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN INTO A SIMILAR LIFE FILLED ME WITH ANGER AND WITH QUESTIONS HOW COULD IT BE ILLEGAL IN ALL THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES
MOVES YOU TO SPEAK UP FOR THESE CHILDREN YOU CAN YOU CAN SUPPORT THE CARE BILL
IS THAT WHEN CHILDREN IN AMERICA IN AGRICULTURE ARE CONCERNED THE SOUL OF AMERICA IS LANGUISHING I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM IN 2002 WHILE MAKING STOLEN CHILDHOOD
YOUR AUDIENCE AND SAY INCREASE YOUR PRICE TAG WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO OR WHAT WE BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE BELIEVE THE WORLD REALLY
THE THREE BIG PROBLEMS HAVE IN COMMON THAT THEY ARE
HAVE THE COURAGE TO UNDERSTAND OR ACCEPT THAT THIS ACTUALLY HOW THE WORLD REALLY WORKS AND THIS IS THE ORDER OF PRIORITY THAT WE NEED TO CHOOSE
I'M LYDIA MITEZA AND TODAY I'M HERE TO DISCUSS 3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIOR THAT CAN AFFECT THE LIVES OF MANY INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE WORLD
FEEL GREAT WHEN I FOLLOW YOUR LEAD AS YOU TAKE THE HIGH ROAD I'M PROUD WHEN YOU STAND UP FOR THE WEAK THE TIMID THE MOCKED
THE FLOCK OF BIRDS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS BEAUTIFUL IN SO MANY WAYS BUT IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEADERS AND FOLLOWERS
FACT WE NEED BOTH FOLLOWERS COMMITTED TO THE RIGHT PRINCIPLES CAN BUILD BETTER
LOOK AROUND DON'T BE SHY WHAT IF WE'D FOLLOWED THE PRINCIPLES LEADERS STOOD FOR AND NOT THE LEADERS THEMSELVES WHAT IF WE'D MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING THE RIGHT IDEAS AND
THAT VALUES BOTH ROLES THAT IS SUPPORTED ON BOTH SIDES THANK YOU
THE POPULAR ONE WE'RE OFTEN ASKED TO BE LEADERS I'D LIKE TO BE A LEADER BUT I DON'T ALWAYS
HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT OUR LEADERS
HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT US AS FOLLOWERS
IF WE ARE TELLING OUR LEADERS THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING THEM FOR THEIR IDEAS THEY
WILL NOT FOCUS ON PERSONAL LOYALTY BUT IN DOING THE RIGHT THING NO MATTER WHAT
THEY WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE THE DIFFICULT PATH
THEM WHO ARE THE ONES YOU FLUTTER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHAT MAKES THIS EVER SO BEAUTIFUL SHAPE THAT OUR EYES ARE NATURALLY DRAWN TO AND HOW DO THESE BIRDS DECIDE ON WHICH IS THE NEXT LEADER
I'VE HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS WITH GREAT LEADERSHIP SKILLS
I'VE ADMIRED THEM FOR THEIR INITIATIVE INTELLIGENCE AND ENERGY
WHAT I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE MORE WAS TO HELP THEM BECOME GREAT LEADERS THOUGH
AND I THINK ABOUT IT EVERYDAY
RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'VE EVER FOLLOWED SOMEONE FOR THE WRONG REASONS
ONE BECAUSE I THINK BEING A GOOD FOLLOWER IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS BEING A GOOD LEADER
BUT WHAT DOES MAKE THEM SO DIFFERENT
THOSE WHO LIKE TO BE IN CONTROL ARE OFTEN GOOD AT TAKING CHARGE AND MAKING DECISIONS
BUT MAINLY FOR THEIR OWN INTEREST
BULLIES DO HAVE A KNACK FOR A COMMANDING ATTITUDE
THEY SCAN FOR VICTIMS AND MAKE DECISIONS TO TEASE HARASS AND WELL BULLY THE
LEADERS WHO WE ADMIRE ON THE OTHER HAND LISTEN
IN COLLABORATION WITH MS COHEN A CORE GROUP OF PRISONERS WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND TO ORGANIZE TODAY'S EVENT
THE DIGNIFIED MANNER
IN WHICH THESE MEN CONQUERED
A MOUNTAIN OF SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES HAS REIGNITED MY BELIEF IN THE RESILIENCE OF THE HUMAN
YOUTH OFFENDERS WITH THE HELP OF SOME OF YOU SEATED IN THIS AUDIENCE TODAY ARE TURNING THEIR LIVES AROUND AND TAKING CONTROL OF THEIR OWN DESTINIES AND 1288 COLLEGE DEGREES HAVE BEEN EARNED RIGHT HERE IN THIS PRISON
BY THEM THAT WAS THE MOMENT THAT A WORLD OF INFINITE POSSIBILITIES REVEALED ITSELF TO US HENCE OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE AND THEME FOR THE DAY INFINITE POSSIBILITIES BEFORE I PASS IT TO STEVE OUR EMCEE I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ONE LAST THING
SAVE LIVES AND SALVAGE FUTURES AND REUNITE FAMILIES BUT IT ALSO HELPS US ACTUALIZE OUR FULL POTENTIAL AND THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE CONFINED IN PRISON WE ARE NOT CONFINED IN OUR DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS
I'M GOING TO ASK EVERYONE IN ATTENDANCE TO DO ME A REALLY REALLY BIG FAVOR PLEASE SUSPEND ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT PRISONERS
THEY SIMULTANEOUSLY CARVE OUT BRIGHTER MORE PROMISING FUTURES AND BY DOING SO THEY WILL TEACH US ALL A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF HOPE
THAT WILL ONE DAY SET ME FREE SIMPLY STATED THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO END MASS INCARCERATION IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO BEGIN MASS EDUCATION IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS IN OUR PRISONS
COLLEGE HAVE INSTILLED HOPE IN THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS AND AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW ONCE THE ETERNAL FLAME OF HOPE IGNITES NO AMOUNT OF ADVERSITY CAN EXTINGUISH IT
A COLLEGE EDUCATION WHEN UTILIZED CORRECTLY PUSHES US CLOSER TO OUR VIOLENT PRINCIPLES AND FORCES US
A TRUE VISIONARY BY THE NAME OF DELIA COHEN INTRODUCED US TO THE TED PHILOSOPHY
A PHILOSOPHY ROOTED IN THE BELIEF THAT FREELY SHARED AND WORTHY IDEAS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE LIVES
TO CHANGE FUTURES AND ULTIMATELY TO CHANGE THE WORLD
A PROJECT OF THIS NATURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
WITHOUT SOMEONE OF DELIA'S STATURE SPEARHEADING OUR EFFORTS
BUT MOST CERTAINLY NOT LEAST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR AUDIENCE YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY SERVES AS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION TO ALL OF US WHO ARE STRIVING TO CHANGE OUR LIVES SO THANK YOU FOR THAT
THAT BEING SAID THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALSO KNOWN AS ARC UTILIZES EDUCATION JOB PLACEMENT POLICY ADVOCACY AND HEALTHY SUPPORT NETWORKS TO ENHANCE THEIR MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO REHABILITATION AND I'M HERE TO TELL
GONZALES AND ROWE LIEUTENANT ABRIL AND PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER MIKE SMITH
ALL WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO SUPPORT THIS INDEPENDENTLY ORGANIZED TEDX EVENT
THEIR UNWAVERING SUPPORT PROVED INVALUABLE
FEW PEOPLE HAVE POSITIVELY INFLUENCED AS MANY LIVES AS YOUTH OFFENDER ADVOCATE AND ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION FOUNDER SCOTT BUDNICK
POINT {LG} NOW FOLKS THIS IS NOT JUST A METAPHOR I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU NOW IT'S TRUE IT'S EXACTLY EQUIVALENT TO TAKING ONE 325 MILLIGRAM ASPIRIN
IMPORTANT TO US AND WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE PROBLEMS
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
AS ARTHUR C CLARKE SAID THE ROTTING OF THE HUMAN MIND
THE BUSINESS OF BELIEVING IN THE PARANORMAL AND THE OCCULT AND THE SUPERNATURAL ALL OF THIS TOTAL NONSENSE THIS MEDIEVAL THINKING I THINK SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THAT AND IT ALL LIES IN EDUCATION
LARGELY IT'S THE MEDIA
WHO ARE TO BLAME FOR THIS SORT OF THING THEY SHAMELESSLY PROMOTE
THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS WE REALLY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SUGGESTIONS FROM YOU FOLKS ON HOW TO CONTACT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO GET THEM TO DO SOMETHING
IF YOU FIND OUT NOW I UNDERSTAND WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE EVEN TODAY SPEAKING TO US ABOUT AIDS EPIDEMICS AND STARVING KIDS AROUND THE WORLD AND IMPURE WATER SUPPLIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SUFFER WITH THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT
WE'VE OFFERED THIS CARROT AS I SAY WE'VE DANGLED THE CARROT WE'RE WAITING FOR THE PSYCHICS TO COME FORTH AND SNAP AT IT OH WE GET LOTS OF THEM HUNDREDS OF THEM EVERY YEAR COME BY THESE ARE DOWSERS AND PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THEY CAN TALK TO THE DEAD AS WELL BUT THEY'RE AMATEURS THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO EVALUATE THEIR OWN SO CALLED POWERS
THE PROFESSIONALS NEVER COME NEAR US EXCEPT IN THAT CASE OF SYLVIA
REALLY SAD TO HEAR AND IT HASN'T HELPED THEM ONE BIT HASN'T SOLVED ANY OF THEIR PROBLEMS YES THERE COULD BE A ROTTING OF THE AMERICAN MIND AND OF THE MINDS ALL THE WAY
THAT THESE PEOPLE PLAY AND THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INNOCENT THE NAIVE THE GRIEVING THE NEEDY PEOPLE OUT THERE NOW THIS IS A
THEY'D LIKE TO TAKE IT JUST TO MAKE ME LOOK SILLY JUST TO GET RID OF THIS GODLESS PERSON OUT THERE THAT SYLVIA BROWNE TALKS ABOUT ALL THE TIME
MORE THAN LAWYERS MAKE I MEAN THAT'S A FABULOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY THESE PEOPLE DON'T NEED THE MILLION DOLLARS PERHAPS BUT WOULDN'T
ON FACEBOOK THEY WANT TO SHARE THEIR SKILLS THEIR RESOURCES THEIR CONNECTIVITY TO THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURES
MANY GREAT DIGITAL HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITIES OUT THERE THAT ARE DOING GREAT THINGS EVERYDAY ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE STORY ABOUT THE COMMUNITY THAT I VOLUNTEER FOR
ALL OVER THE WORLD AND PART OF WHAT WE DID IS WE PARTNERED WITH THE GISCORPS TO LOOK AT
WERE 65 CRISIS CAMPS IN 10 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH ABOUT 25000 PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IT WAS TRULY AMAZING
ABOUT A DIGITAL HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY CALLED CRISIS COMMONS
TO GO OUT AND SEARCH FOR OPEN DATA SETS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR THEIR
OF IDEAS AND THEY CAN WORK NOT ONLY DURING THE RESPONSE TO SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS TO SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS BUT WHAT THEY CAN ALSO DO IS THEY CAN WORK BEFORE THE CRISIS WHEN I WOULD
AND WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING HE STARTED A FEW CONFERENCE CALLS MIGHT YOU TIM SCHWARTZ IS AN ARTIST IN HIS DAY JOB THAT WHAT HE DOES DURING THE DAY HE STARTED A FEW CONFERENCES CALLS AND THEN THOSE CONFERENCE CALLS TURN INTO A WRITTEN FRAMEWORK AND NOW
OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING BEFORE THE CRISIS WE TRULY NEED TO HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS MADE
REALLY ALL ABOUT CREATING THE RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE THE DISASTER BEING ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS
LIKE YOUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH WITH THE TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN RELIEF COMMUNITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOW CAN
NAME IS HEATHER BLANCHARD AND I'M A VOLUNTEER BUT MIGHT NOT BE
SAID YOU KNOW CAN WE REALLY DO THIS BETTER ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS HOW CAN WE CONNECT THIS BECAUSE
IS FOR THAT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OFTEN DIGITAL HUMANITARIANS WHEN THEY OFFERING
WITH OFFICIAL RESPONSE SYSTEMS AND SO IF WE DO THAT WE'RE REALLY ABLE TO HAVE A TRUE GLOBAL UNITED RESPONSE
DIALOGUE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE BUT IT TRANSFORMED ITSELF
DOES THAT MAKE THEIR CONTRIBUTION ANY LESS CAN THEY
HAPPINESS OR EVEN STUDYING OLD JOURNALS THE DATA WERE BASED ENTIRELY ON WHETHER PEOPLE LOOKED HAPPY IN THESE EARLY PICTURES
BY 75 PERCENT NOW I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T GET THIS ONE AT ALL MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE WATCHED QUITE A FEW
BUT IT OBVIOUSLY HASN'T AND IT PROBABLY NEVER WILL MAKES OUR LIVES SEEM UNBEARABLY GRIM IN COMPARISON AND
YOU'RE IN IT OR YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR IT I BELIEVE MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION
LEGAL BENEFITS TO BEING SOMEONE'S SPOUSE A LIST THAT
BEING THIN AND GOOD LOOKING WHEREAS MEN MOSTLY CARE ABOUT SEX
AND IT'S NOT JUST SUCCESSFULLY STARRING IN FILMS THAT'S DANGEROUS IT TURNS OUT MERELY
FOR INSTANCE IN MY MARRIAGE I'D SAY I'M DOING OKAY ONE THE ONE HAND
AND I'M GLAD THEY MAKE ME LESS LIKELY THAN SOME PEOPLE TO GET DIVORCE
APPLYING TO COLLEGE THE FIRST STEP STEPPING ON A STAGE THE
IN EITHER SO TODAY I INVITE YOU TO TRY SOMETHING NEW TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN
EXCUSE ME THE DAILY MAIL NEWSPAPER IN LONDON THE DAY I SHADOWED WAS THE BIRTH OF THE ROYAL BABY A VERY BIG DAY IN MEDIA {LG} SO
AS ALBERT EINSTEIN ONCE SAID A SHIP IS
YEAR I AM PROMOTED TO EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE NEWSPAPER AND I
MY SIXTH AND SEVENTH GRADE SEASONS I SAT ON THE BENCH AT EVERY SATURDAY GAME BUT FINALLY
WORKED ON SOME WITH STACKED CARBON BETTER THAN MOST SPECIES OF TREES ON EARTH THE
WE'RE BUILDING ARCHIVAL LIVING LIBRARIES AROUND THE WORLD
BRINGS THE VALUE OF THAT TREE TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY OR YOUR COMMUNITY OR YOUR PARK OR YOUR SCHOOLS
162000
SO IF WE HAD TO HIRE THE MACHINES
OR RENT THE MACHINES TO DO WHAT THAT ONE TREE WOULD DO
IN 50 YEARS YOU WOULD HAVE SAVED 162000
NOW I ASK YOU
WHO CAN AFFORD NOT TO PLANT TREES
WHAT IF YOU PLANTED TEN OF THOSE TREES
NOW I'D
LIKE TO ASK YOU TO THINK
THERE'S ENOUGH ANCIENT TREES OR OLD GROWTH TREES LEFT
THAT WE CAN GET A VERY GOOD CROSS
GENETIC
REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD'S TREES THAT
OUR SCIENTISTS TELL US ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
THAT STACK THE CARBON THE FASTEST
PHYTOREMEDIATE OUT OF OUR SOILS AND OUR AIRS
THE TOXINS AND THE POISONS
AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS SUCH
THAT WE CAN MAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THESE TREES AVAILABLE TO THE WORLD
SO THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE CAN REBUILD THE
ASCEND THE TREES
LOOK FOR TISSUE AND MATERIAL FROM NEAR THE TOP OF THE TREES BRING IT BACK DOWN
THEN WE SEND IT TO OUR PROPOGATION FACILITIES AROUND THE WORLD
AND WITH LUCK A LOT OF LUCK
BECAUSE MOST OF THESE TREES HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO BE CLONED BEFORE
THE TISSUE WILL FORM ROOT
TELLS US THAT WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF CARBON IN OUR ATMOSPHERE IN
FACT WAY TOO MUCH
THAT CARBON THEY BELIEVE IS A CONTRIBUTOR
TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE
PLANET WARMING UP
MELTING OUR GLACIERS CHOKING OUR CHILDREN
IS GOING TO RAISE REAL HAVOC IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS THAT'S WHAT SOME SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING
WELL HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS
HERE IN CALIFORNIA TWO OF THE TREES THAT WE'RE WORKING ON ARE GIANT SEQUOIAS
AND
THAT WE MUST REPLACE OR GUESS WHO'S THE FISH
STACKING THE CARBON
AND WHAT DO THEY PRODUCE VOILA THE OXYGEN THAT WE ALL NEED TO SURVIVE
SO THANK YOU NASA
YOU KIND OF HELPED KICK START THIS PROJECT OFF OVER 40 YEARS AGO IN YOUR EFFORTS AND I APPLAUD YOU
ONE
THING I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT
IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS TALK I ALLUDED TO
THIS TALK WOULD ONLY BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE OF YOU THAT
REDWOODS A MATURE COAST REDWOOD CAN WEIGH UP TO
IS GONE IT'S BEEN CUT DOWN 98
WE'RE GOING TO USE THOSE TO INTERBREED WITH A FRAGMENTED FOREST THAT'S LEFT HERE ON EARTH NOW HERE ARE SOME STATS
TOGETHER
WE ALL FIND OURSELVES AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MILLENIUM
FACING ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES OF ENORMOUS PROPORTION
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO SOLVE THEM
AND FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS
OUR GROUP HAS BEEN CROSSING THIS COUNTRY
AND OTHER COUNTRIES
JOB
STACK CARBON FASTER
ABSORB IT OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE
FASTER THAN MOST ANY SPECIES OF TREE ON EARTH AND WHERE WILL THEY GROW
THEY CAN GROW VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE AROUND THE PLANET
THEY GROW WELL IN MANY MANY COUNTRIES SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING
IS TO CLONE THE WORLD'S OLDEST AND LARGEST TREES AND
MAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF THESE AVAILABLE TO THE WORLD
TO PLANT AS CARBON SINKS
TO PULL THE EXCESS CARBON OUT OF THE AIR STORE IT SAFELY
AND START TO GO AFTER THIS NEMESIS THAT WE CALL CLIMATE CHANGE
BY THE WAY
THAT SAME TREE COAST REDWOOD
THAT CAN WEIGH UP TO 1000
IS
HOW DO YOU CLONE THOSE OLD FOREST GIANTS THOSE TREES THAT ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD
WELL THAT'S AN ANGEL OAK HERE IN THIS COUNTRY
THE SLIDE BEFORE THIS WAS 3000 YEAR OLD GIANT SEQUOIA
HERE IN CALIFORNIA
AND THAT WAS MY SON JAKE THAT WAS CLIMBING THIS TREE HE'S ONE OF OUR CLIMBERS
THAT'S THE SIZE TREES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AROUND
WE HAVE A SAYING AT ARCHANGEL ANCIENT TREE ARCHIVE THAT WE SAY TO EACH OTHER SINCERELY THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING FOR
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
WE HAVE LEFT THE JUNK OF THE JUNK OF THE JUNK OF THE JUNK
GENETICALLY
WHAT SORT OF A BASE DOES THAT LEAVE TO REBUILD
FOREST SYSTEMS WITH STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEMS
FORESTS THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE CLIMATE CHANGE
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FOR EARTH
THAT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN DREAMS AND YOU SHOULD FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS
YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEAUTIFUL HIGH MOUNTAINS WITH FANTASTIC VIEWS FANTASTIC WEATHER BUT GUESS WHAT THE WEATHER SUCKED
DID SHE FIND ALL THIS MONEY HOW DID IT HAPPEN
WELL IT JUST HAPPENED I WAS TELLING ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT
THIS EXCITING ADVENTURE FRIENDS COLLEAGUES ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I KNEW AND FINALLY IT ALL WORKED OUT FINE
SO YOU MAY BE WONDERING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE ARE SEVEN CONTINENTS WHY THERE MORE THAN SEVEN DOTS ON THIS MAP
AND I'M AFRAID I DO NOT HAVE A GOOD ANSWER
AND THIS IS MY NEXT BIG TASK BUT DEFINITELY AFTER THIS ADVENTURE I'M A
OBVIOUSLY PLUS WHAT IT MEANT FOR ME PERSONALLY
TO PUT IT SIMPLY SO SOMEONE HAS RESPONDED HAVE YOU EVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO THE TOILET
AND THEN IT'S LIKE IN ROCK CLIMBING IF YOU STAND IN FRONT OF A HUGE
COULD YOU PLEASE ALL THINK ABOUT THE GREATEST SMARTEST BEST PERSON EVER FOR YOU PERSONALLY
HAVE THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD LIKE I DO THIS THEN IT
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S MOUNT KOSCIUSKO AND THIS VERSION IS NICE
YOU GO ON AND GO ON AND IT'S LIKE THAT SO THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD TRY TO GO IN SMALL STEPS THAT'S WHAT I DID AND
THERE I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MOUNTAINEERING EXPERIENCE AT THAT POINT OF TIME SO FINALLY ONE
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT COULD BE ONE SMALL THING THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL
THERE WAS SNOW ON THE GROUND SO NOT QUITE AS WE IMAGINED BUT WELL WE STARTED TO WALK THAT
LIKE TO DO A SMALL EXERCISE FOR YOU
AND THE POWER OF DREAMS BECAUSE WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT DREAMS ARE THERE FOR
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME DREAMS SOME THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE SO I'M NOT ASKING YOU TODAY TO CHANGE THE WORLD OR TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE COMPLETELY AND GO OUT THERE AND CLIMB
EVEREST SO YOU MAY SAY WAS I SUCCESSFUL WELL
SO LET'S GET STARTED I'D LIKE TO COVER TODAY THE IDEA HOW IT ALL STARTED
23 MAY 2008 AND THE WHOLE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN
START CLIMBING AND THEN IT BECOMES EASIER AS YOU
WOULD BE YOUR PERSONAL THING THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE
THAT PERSON WAS FOR YOU AND WHY THIS PARTICULAR PERSON COULD YOU THINK FOR A SHORT MOMENT
WOW I DID IT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
CLIMBING SNOWBOARDING SKIING YEAH YOU CAN RAISE YOUR HAND OH THANK
BETRAYS THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE
BY LETTING OUR CARS TALK TO EACH OTHER I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE EXPERIENCE OF DRIVING IS LIKE NOW GET INTO YOUR
A SERIES OF THREE CAMERAS WE CAN DETECT IF A DRIVER IS LOOKING FORWARD LOOKING AWAY LOOKING DOWN ON THE PHONE OR HAVING A CUP OF COFFEE
THOSE CARS WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE VELOCITY OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF US TO SEE HOW FAST THAT GUY'S GOING OR STOPPING IF THAT GUY'S GOING DOWN TO ZERO I'LL KNOW
I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING AND I BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ONLY WATCH SO MUCH BUT THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS NOW THAT CAN HELP US IMPROVE THAT
WELL IT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS ONE THE ABILITY OF THE CAR AND SECOND THE ABILITY OF THE DRIVER IF ONE GUY HAS A REALLY GREAT CAR BUT THEY'RE ON THEIR
CAN YOU PREDICT THE FUTURE THAT'S REALLY HARD ACTUALLY NO WITH CARS IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE CARS ARE THREE DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS
HOW DO WE GET THERE WE CAN START WITH SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS SHARING OUR POSITION DATA BETWEEN CARS JUST SHARING GPS
OUR PRIVACY JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR CAR FROM THE OUTSIDE I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT YOU IF I LOOK AT YOUR LICENSE PLATE NUMBER I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO YOU ARE
VELOCITY GOOD ESTIMATE HE'LL CONTINUE GOING 85 MILES AN HOUR YOU'LL KNOW BECAUSE YOUR CAR WILL KNOW BECAUSE THAT OTHER CAR WILL HAVE WHISPERED SOMETHING IN HIS EAR LIKE BY THE WAY FIVE MINUTES MOTORCYCLIST WATCH OUT
PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHERE A CAR'S GOING TO BE IN THE NEAR FUTURE EVEN IF WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR CAR AND SOME MOTORCYCLIST COMES
MOVED THIS RESEARCH OUT OF THE COMPUTER SIMULATION AND INTO ROBOT TEST BEDS THAT HAVE THE ACTUAL SENSORS THAT ARE IN CARS NOW ON THESE ROBOTS STEREO CAMERAS GPS AND THE TWO DIMENSIONAL
WAY TO DRIVE WHY DO WE DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE DO I LOOK HERE
SEEN ROADWAYS
IN AND AMONGST OTHER METAL GIANTS AT SUPER HUMAN SPEEDS
OKAY AND ALL YOU HAVE TO GUIDE YOU ARE YOUR TWO EYES
OKAY SO THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE EYES THAT WEREN'T REALLY DESIGNED FOR THIS TASK BUT
THEN PEOPLE ASK YOU TO DO THINGS LIKE YOU WANT TO MAKE A LANE CHANGE WHAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY ASK YOU DO
FUNDAMENTALLY THESE TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TODAY I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE FACE IS OUR OWN WILLINGNESS TO SHARE OUR DATA
LET'S FACE IT DRIVING IS DANGEROUS IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT
FOR EVERYONE SO LET YOUR CAR GOSSIP ABOUT YOU IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE ROADS A LOT SAFER
MILES AN HOUR DOWN LANE SPLITTING KNOW YOU'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE THAT GUY DIDN'T JUST COME OUT OF NOWHERE THAT GUY'S BEEN ON THE ROAD PROBABLY FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR {LG} RIGHT I MEAN SOMEBODY'S SEEN HIM
THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME I SAW THE BRAKE LIGHTS GO ON I'M LIKE OKAY ALL RIGHT THIS GUY IS SLOWING DOWN I'LL SLOW DOWN TOO I STEP ON THE BRAKE BUT NO THIS GUY ISN'T SLOWING DOWN THIS GUY IS STOPPING DEAD STOP DEAD STOP ON THE HIGHWAY IT WAS JUST GOING 65 TO ZERO
AND YOU CAN PREDICT THE NEW TRAJECTORY SO YOU DON'T ONLY KNOW THAT HE'S GOING OFF COURSE YOU KNOW HOW AND YOU KNOW WHICH DRIVERS YOU NEED TO ALERT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
SAME WITH THE OTHER CARS THEY CAN HAVE A PRECISE IDEA OF WHERE THEY ARE AND SORT OF A VAGUE IDEA OF WHERE THE OTHER CARS ARE WHAT HAPPENS IF TWO CARS SHARE THAT DATA IF THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS BOTH MODELS IMPROVE
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT THING I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT THE DISTRACTED TEENAGER BEHIND YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE BRAKING
PRECISELY
AND THEY CAN AVOID EACH OTHER
WE'RE NOW ADDING MORE AND MORE ROBOTS INTO THE MIX
AND WE ENCOUNTERED SOME PROBLEMS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WHEN YOU GET TOO MUCH CHATTER
IT'S HARD TO PROCESS ALL THE PACKETS
SO YOU HAVE TO PRIORITIZE AND THAT'S WHERE THE PREDICTIVE MODEL HELPS YOU
HERE WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT AND USUALLY WE DO A FANTASTIC JOB PICKING AND CHOOSING WHAT WE ATTEND TO ON THE ROAD
75 PERCENT OF THESE ACCIDENTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH DRUGS OR ALCOHOL SO WHAT HAPPENS
AT SOME POINT COMES FROM NATURE AND IT'S HOW YOU USE THE MATERIAL THAT DICTATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND MAKING BETTER CHOICES THAT RESULT IN NET ENVIRONMENTAL GAINS
REALLY BIG IN THE U K NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OWN AN ELECTRIC TEA KETTLE
PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE THROWN OUT THAT ARE MADE OUT OF BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS IF THEY END UP IN LANDFILL CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE
NATURAL ENDS UP IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IT DEGRADES NORMALLY ITS LITTLE CARBON MOLECULES THAT IT STORED UP AS IT WAS GROWING ARE NATURALLY RELEASED BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS CARBON DIOXIDE BUT THIS IS A NET SITUATION
WHICH THE SYSTEM CAN BE FAR MORE SUSTAINABLE
THE THING IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS IF WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ADDRESS SUSTAINABILITY OF
GOODS AND HOW THE CONSUMER GOODS THAT WE HAVE KIND OF BECOME IMMUNE TO THAT FILL OUR LIVES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND THESE GUYS ARE
HAVE A HABIT OF GOING SOGGY IN THE CRISPER DRAWERS DON'T THEY YEAH SOGGY LETTUCES IN THE U K THIS IS SUCH A PROBLEM THAT THERE WAS A GOVERNMENT REPORT A FEW YEARS AGO THAT ACTUALLY SAID
IS BECAUSE THERE'S A UNIQUE PHENOMENON THAT HAPPENS IN THE U K THE MOMENT THAT VERY POPULAR TV SHOWS END THE MINUTE THE AD BREAK COMES
OF FOOD PER ANNUM AND I BLAME IT ON THE REFRIGERATOR WELL ESPECIALLY IN WESTERN CULTURES
HAVE THINGS AT THE BACK OF MY REFRIGERATOR THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS ALL RIGHT AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE WASTE MORE FOOD AND AS I WAS JUST EXPLAINING FOOD WASTE
AT THE END OF LIFE BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD TO GROW THAT LETTUCE
SINGLE ONE OF THESE STAGES THE THINGS THAT WE DO HAVE AN
I'M SURE ARE IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW COULD POTENTIALLY LOOK AT DOING WHAT WE CALL CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS OR PRODUCT SYSTEM SERVICES SO
WHERE THIS PROCESS CALLED LIFE CYCLE THINKING COMES IN SO ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING THAT IS CREATED GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF LIFE CYCLE STAGES AND WE USE THIS SCIENTIFIC PROCESS
AT THE WRONG PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS WITH USE IT'S WITH HOW PEOPLE USE THE PRODUCT
END OF THE SPECTRUM WHEN WE PRODUCE MATERIALS WE
LAUGH AND IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT 22 MILLION PHONES ARE IN PEOPLE'S DRAWERS
I SAID HOW COME YOU'RE NOT DOING SUSTAINABILITY I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS AND HE SAID WELL
OF THE WORLD'S PRODUCED FOOD IS WASTED THAT'S THE LATEST U N STATS UP TO HALF OF THE FOOD IT'S INSANE IT'S 1 3 BILLION
DESIGN FOR LIGHT WEIGHTING WE HEARD SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIES BEING USED IN THE TESLA MOTORS CAR TODAY
THESE KINDS OF APPROACHES ARE NOT HARD BUT UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM AND THEN LOOKING FOR VIABLE MARKET DRIVEN CONSUMER DEMAND ALTERNATIVES IS HOW WE CAN START RADICALLY ALTERING
THE SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA
THERE'S ONLY A FEW MATERIALS THAT YOU SHOULD COMPLETELY AVOID THE REST OF THEM IT'S ALL
HOW HIGH LOW YOU ARE IN THE PECKING ORDER HAS AN IMPACT ON ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS
AND ELEGANT DESIGN SOLUTIONS THAT WILL SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS
AN AIRLESS ENVIRONMENT TO PREVENT THE DEGRADING THAT WOULD HAPPEN NATURALLY BUT THE CRISPER DRAWERS THEY'RE JUST A DRAWER WITH A SLIGHTLY BETTER SEAL ANYWAY I'M CLEARLY OBSESSED DON'T EVER INVITE ME OVER BECAUSE I'LL JUST START GOING THROUGH YOUR REFRIGERATOR AND LOOKING AT ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT BUT
THERE IS A MARKET DEMAND AND THAT MARKET DEMAND'S NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE SO YOU DESIGN THE PRODUCT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
A FIVE AND A HALF CUPS OF WATER JUST TO MAKE ONE CUP OF TEA
IT A FAR BIGGER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAN THE LOSS OF THE ENERGY FROM THE FRIDGE
WITH THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND WE CAN MONITOR HOW THAT INTERACTION IS ACTUALLY AFFECTING THE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT MAKE LIFE ON EARTH POSSIBLE
REDUCING THE NET ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT OUR ACTIONS AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS PROFESSIONALS AND AS A SOCIETY ARE ACTUALLY HAVING ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT SO
ELEGANTLY SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS THAT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND THE ENTIRE LIFE OF THE THING EVERYTHING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE EXTRACTION THROUGH TO THE END OF LIFE WE CAN START TO ACTUALLY FIND REALLY INNOVATIVE
IT SUGATA MITRA I THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT FILM
SO WE LAUNCHED THESE SEVEN SCHOOLS THE MOST
THANK YOU SO I ASKED THE CHILDREN HOW DID YOU LEARN TO SPEAK IN ENGLISH SO QUICKLY
SAID YOU KNOW THOSE CHILDREN ARE VERY SWEET THEY SAID WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK
AWAY AND THE COACHMAN THE MAN WHO USED TO DRIVE THE HORSE AND
BUT I KNOW THAT I WILL FIND THE WAY I STILL HAVE ONE MORE YEAR TO
I KNOW THERE ARE STUDENTS HERE AND I KNOW THAT THE EXAMINATION IS THE ONLY DAY IN THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET
WHEN I STARTED I THOUGHT I WAS SAYING SCHOOLS WILL BE OBSOLETE
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENTS OF DIFFERENT
THE PASSENGERS ARE DRIVING THE CAR
WILL NOT HAVE A ROLE THAT'S NOT TRUE THAT'S NOT TRUE
THE CHILDREN SAID WHY DOES THE SKYPED IN GRANNY
THE BEST ONES IN ENGLAND HAD EVERYTHING
I USED TO GET CALLED TO CONFERENCES I STILL DO
WHAT IS THE SCHOOL IN THE CLOUD WELL LET ME GIVE YOU A SMALL EXAMPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE USED TO
WHO SAYS MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT WAS WELL DONE
THE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS BUT WHO MAKES THE
I NOTICED A DISTINCT BIRMINGHAM ACCENT {LG}
WHAT HAPPENED WE BUILT SEVEN SCHOOLS IN THE CLOUD
OF COURSE THEY MAKE SENSE MY FATHER MIGHT BE CONSIDERED WEIRD NO TELEVISION WAS ALLOWED AT HOME WHEN I WAS GROWING
AT AGE 73 HE'S IN EXCELLENT SHAPE {LG} YOU MIGHT THINK MY MOTHER'S WEIRD TOO SHE WENT FOR NATURAL CHILDBIRTH AND WAS COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE NURSING US IN PUBLIC EVEN NOW
FEAR OUR OCEANS ARE IN COLLAPSE LET'S TALK ABOUT AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH WE'RE KILLING 75 MILLION LAND AND WATER ANIMALS IN THE US EACH DAY AND LOSING DOZENS OF SPECIES ENTIRELY
AND BEST OF ALL MY SPIRITUAL CONNECTION BECAME MUCH STRONGER IT TRULY WAS MIRACULOUS FOR ME AND I WONDERED WHY EVERYONE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS SOMEHOW WE'VE CONVINCED OURSELVES THAT WE'RE THE MOST
WERE MIRACULOUS CHRONIC ACHES AND PAINS FROM INJURIES DISAPPEARED IN THE FIRST WEEK IT TURNS OUT MY
THIRTIETH OF THE WATER THAT FLESH EATERS DO
ACCORDING TO UNITED NATIONS STUDY
WE'RE CUTTING DOWN OUR MAGNIFICENT RAIN FOREST AT THE RATE OF ONE ACRE PER SECOND FOR SOY BEANS TO FEED CATTLE CHICKENS PIGS AND FISH
AND WHAT
WE'RE DECIMATING THE OCEANS BY OVERFISHING
MARINE
MUST HAVE GOTTEN IT SECOND HAND AND HE'S A HEALTH NUT NO SUGAR WAS ALLOWED AT HOME HE EVEN LOBBIED SUCCESSFULLY FOR A CANDY FREE CHECKOUT LANE {LG} THESE
A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO SQUIRRELS {LG} ONE SAYS TO THE OTHER DID YOU SEE THE LATEST RESEARCH {LG} EVERY OTHER SPECIES EXCEPT OUR DOMESTICATED PETS EATS WHAT THEY'RE DESIGNED TO
THEIR COWS AND IN FACT OWNING THEM AS PROPERTY
WE CERTAINLY HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER OPTIONS THESE DAYS
SO WHAT THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ANIMAL CONSUMPTION BEHAVIOR
ACCORDING TO T COLIN CAMPBELL WHO CONDUCTED THE LARGEST MULTI GENERATIONAL NUTRITION RESEARCH PROJECT IN HISTORY
PEOPLE WITH TRADITIONALLY VEGAN DIETS HAD VIRTUALLY NO CANCER OR HEART DISEASE
AND THOSE WITH DIETS INCLUDING MEAT AND DAIRY DID
YOU MIGHT FIND A FEW EXAMPLES OF FARMERS WITH WHAT APPEAR TO BE CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS BUT HOW MUCH WILDLIFE AROUND THEM HAS TO BE KILLED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THOSE FARMS AND IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE ARE BECAUSE WITH THE LAND WE HAVE
TO NURSE ALL OF OUR LIVES FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SPECIES NATIVE AMERICANS DIDN'T DO IT AND APPARENTLY WERE SHOCKED TO SEE THE EUROPEAN SETTLERS
SHARP TEETH LIKE CARNIVORES AND OMNIVORES
AND WE'D HAVE STRONG SHARP CLAWS
LADIES HOW EASY IS IT TO BREAK A NAIL
AND WE'D HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SALIVA AND A DIFFERENT DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
AND WE'D HAVE THE INSTINCTS FOR IT
WHICH REACTION WOULD YOU EXPECT OF A FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL GETTING A CUTE LITTLE BUNNY IN HER EASTER BASKET
WOULD SHE BE OVERCOME WITH JOY AND WANT TO CUDDLE THAT BUNNY
OR WOULD SHE PROCEED TO
FIRST ANIMAL FOODS CLOG THE ARTERIES DR MASON ADVISES HIS PATIENTS TO GO VEGAN FOR THEIR HEALTH AND FOR THEIR SEX
MY MOTIVATION TO GO VEG WAS NOT HEALTH IT WAS SIMPLY THE GROSS OUT FACTOR OF EATING DEAD ANIMALS
I WAS THRILLED THE MOMENT I LEARNED I DIDN'T NEED TO EAT ANIMALS TO SURVIVE
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS I DIDN'T KNOW A SINGLE OTHER VEGETARIAN
I FELT PRETTY ALONE
AND I HOPED NOBODY WOULD NOTICE I WASN'T EATING MEAT I JUST WANTED TO BE ACCEPTED
MY DIET WAS REASONABLY GOOD BUT NOT OPTIMAL
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD AND IF YOU SPEND YOUR PRECIOUS TIME AND ENERGY TRYING TO FIT IN IT WILL BE SUCH LOSS TO ALL OF US
REMEMBER ONCE UPON A TIME SLAVERY WAS NORMAL
AND IT WAS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT
AND ONCE UPON TIME IT WAS NORMAL TO SMOKE IN
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO I BELIEVE MY PARENTS HELPED MAKE ME A CURIOUS AND INQUISITIVE PERSON AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I'VE BEEN RESEARCHER AND WRITER AND FOOD HAS ALWAYS BEEN OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO
AND THE WORK OF TURNING ANIMALS INTO FOOD IS NO FUN
SLAUGHTERHOUSE WORKERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF SUICIDE OF ANY OCCUPATION
IT'S NO WONDER THEY'RE WORKING IN HELL ON EARTH
ACCORDING TO MERCY FOR ANIMALS SLAUGHTERHOUSES FACTORY FARMS AND DAIRIES HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF EGREGIOUS CRUELTY EVERY TIME ANYONE HAS INVESTIGATED THEM
THAT BY HONORING YOURSELF YOU'RE ALSO HONORING ALL OF HUMANITY THIS PLANET WE SHARE AND THE ANIMAL KINGDOM TOO
DO YOU BELIEVE WHERE YOUR FOOD COMES FROM MIGHT AFFECT YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE
I SURE DO SO I'LL BE ENJOYING MY FOOD FROM HEAVEN ON
DID I GET HERE IT STARTED WAY BACK AT CONCEPTION WITH PARENTS WHO DEFY CONVENTION AND SOCIAL NORMS
ARE PLANT STRONG SOME PEOPLE SAY THE VEGAN LIFESTYLE DOESN'T WORK FOR THEIR BODIES HAVE THEY REALLY TRIED ALL 20000 PLANT FOODS BEFORE GIVING UP DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE 7500 VARIETIES OF
DAY HEALTH CHALLENGE WITH YOU
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE HEALTHIER
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE SUPPORT YOU'LL BE REAPING THE BENEFITS TOGETHER
MOST IMPORTANTLY KNOW THAT YOU DESERVE TO LIVE A HAPPY AND HEALTHY LIFE
AND EVERY BITE YOU TAKE IS A CHOICE TO HONOR THIS TIME YOU HAVE ON EARTH
AND HOW MAGNIFICENT
WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE ELIMINATION OF PLANT FOODS AFTER THE GREAT FLOOD DOCUMENTED IN THE BIBLE WHO KNOWS AND WHY DID WE START NURSING FROM COWS
ARE THEY'RE MORE SATISFYING BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE NUTRIENT DENSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO RECIPES HERE BUT YOU CAN FIND MY RAW AND VEGAN RECIPES ON YOUTUBE OR IF
NOT INTO SPENDING TIME IN THE KITCHEN THAT'S OK
PLENTY OF PLANT FOODS ARE PERFECT JUST AS THEY ARE
HOW ABOUT GRABBING AN ORGANIC APPLE OR A BANANA OR AN ORANGE ON YOUR WAY OUT THE DOOR
EVEN A CUCUMBER'S EASY TO EAT ON THE RUN HYDRATING TOO JUST WASH IT AND BITE INTO IT AS IT IS THAT'S WHAT I CALL FAST FOOD
SALAD IS EASY AND LEAFY GREENS ARE SO BENEFICIAL
WE SHOULD REALLY BE EATING THEM EVERYDAY
ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF SECOND HAND SMOKE BUT HE HAD LOST HIS MOTHER AND FATHER TO LUNG CANCER EVEN THOUGH ONLY HIS FATHER SMOKED SO HE PUT 2 AND 2 TOGETHER AND FIGURED HIS
PEACE DIET AND HE SAID THAT THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND WAR IS INEQUALITY
WHAT IF EVERYONE HAD ENOUGH FOOD
AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES TO OUR ENVIRONMENT
ACCORDING TO A WORLD BANK STUDY
52 OF THE CLIMATE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY ANIMAL AGRICULTURE
DR JOHN MCDOUGALL SAID IT TAKES 17 ORGANIC VEGANS TO DO THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE OF 1 PERSON ON THE STANDARD AMERICAN DIET
AND VEGANS USE JUST
MASON FORMER NATIONAL CHAIRMAN OF UROLOGY AT THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND FORMER COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO SAID ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IS AN EARLY WARNING SIGN FOR HEART DISEASE
HE CALLS IT THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE IT
TURNS OUT IT'S ALL ABOUT BLOOD FLOW THE
ARTERIES TO THE PENIS ARE SMALLER THAN THE ARTERIES TO THE HEART
AND SO THEY GET
YOU'LL BE MORE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE THE CHLOROPHYLL FROM PLANT FOODS MAKE YOU GLOW FROM THE INSIDE OUT YOU'LL BE MORE KIND TO HUMANITY MORE KIND TO THE ANIMALS MORE KIND TO THE PLANET AND YOU'LL BE AN INSPIRATION TO OTHERS HELPING TO MAKE OUR WORLD A BETTER
SIMPLY CANNOT FEED OUR POPULATION ON AN ANIMAL BASED DIET NATURE IS ABUNDANT SO WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO EAT ANIMALS WHEN THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OF PLANT FOODS AVAILABLE TO US THERE ARE MANY REASONS
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE STARVING TO DEATH
WHY IS THAT
WE'RE GROWING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED MORE THAN TWICE THE POPULATION OF ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD BUT IN THE US 80 OF THE CROPS ARE GROWN FOR AND FED TO LIVESTOCK THAT WILL BE SLAUGHTERED FOR MEAT
COULD OUR WORLD BE A MORE PEACEFUL PLACE
DR WILL TUTTLE WHO HAPPENS
ONLY RAW VEGAN ORGANIC PLANT BASED FOODS AND I DOCUMENTED IT IN MY FILM SUPERCHARGE ME 30 DAYS RAW IT WAS NOT AN EASY TRANSITION BUT
AND IN THE 1970S EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY WHEN HE VOLUNTEERED HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF FREE
DON'T HAVE THE TIME FOR A SALAD THROW SOME GREENS IN THE BLENDER WITH YOUR FAVORITE FRUIT AND YOU'LL HAVE A DELICIOUS NUTRITIOUS AND SATISFYING GREEN SMOOTHIE OR MAKE A SAVORY BLENDED GREEN SOUP HOW ABOUT STARTING TO GROW SOME OF YOUR OWN FOOD IT'S EASY TO START WITH HERBS AND
NOW IT'S A PRIVATELY HELD COMPANY WITH COMMUNITY MINDED OWNERSHIP BUT I WOULD LIKE IT TO BECOME ONE
DID IT THROUGH COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT CAPITALISM WAS NEVER GOING TO FINANCE BLACK LIBERATION SO THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT EXAMPLES IN THIS BOOK AND I SUGGEST THAT EVERYBODY
JOBS ARE ON THE STEEP DECLINE AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO START CALLING ON OUR UNIONS TO REALLY BRING ALL OF THEIR FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL CAPITAL TO BEAR IN THE CREATION OF NEW UNION LIVING WAGE JOBS IN OUR
AMERICA'S WORKING CLASS HAS BEEN PAYING UNION DUES FOR DECADES AND WITH IT OUR UNIONS HAVE BEEN BUILDING DIGNIFIED DECENT AND DEMOCRATIC WORKPLACES FOR
ARE OUR COMMUNITIES BROKE LIKE WE'RE NOT JUST BROKE BECAUSE WE'RE
MONDRAGON SPAIN IS A COMMUNITY BUILT ENTIRELY AROUND WORKER COOPERATIVES THERE'S 260 PLUS BUSINESSES HERE MANUFACTURING EVERYTHING FROM
DECIDED TO LAUNCH AN INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVE TO CREATE MORE
BUILT UNIVERSITIES AND HOSPITALS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I MEAN IMAGINE IF WE COULD BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN SOUTH CENTRAL
TO TRANSFORMERS AND THIS GROUP OF BUSINESSES NOW EMPLOYS 80000
FOUNDED BY BLACK AND LATINX HOME CARE WORKERS WHO ARE NOW ABLE TO PAY THEMSELVES LIVING WAGES THEY HAVE FULL TIME HOURS THEY HAVE BENEFITS AND A PENSION THROUGH THEIR MEMBERSHIP AS UNIT OF
WHICH WAS WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET THE WEALTH TO BUILD THE TYPES OF BUSINESS THAT WE WANT AND THE ANSWER IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF COOPERATIVISM WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS WORKER
PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR WE'VE RECYCLED HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF
AND ALL OF THE COMPANIES THERE ARE OWNED BY THE PEOPLE THAT
PRIMARILY BECAUSE RACISM AND CAPITALISM ARE BEST HOMIES BUT {LG} BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WHEN WE ASK
JOIN US BECAUSE IT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US IN ORDER TO BUILD THE MORE JUST AND SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT ECONOMY THAT WE WANT FOR OURSELVES
BOX STORES TO OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE HONESTLY THOSE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENTS THEY STEAL RESOURCES FROM OUR COMMUNITIES THEY PUT OUR MOM AND POP
I MOVED IN WITH MY GRANDMOTHER AND I WAS ABLE TO RENT OUR FIRST WAREHOUSE BUY OUR FIRST TRUCK
THINK OF IS WHAT AN HONOR IT IS AS A POLITICIAN TO GIVE A TED TALK PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE U K WHERE THE REPUTATION OF POLITICS WITH THE EXPENSES SCANDAL HAS SUNK SO LOW THERE WAS EVEN A STORY RECENTLY THAT
AND THE REALLY SIMPLE ARGUMENT I WANT TO MAKE TONIGHT THE REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD ARGUMENT IS THIS
THE POLICE HAVE THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH CRIMES ARE COMMITTED WHERE AND WE HAVE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT TO TRY AND HOLD THE POLICE TO ACCOUNT SUDDENLY WE'VE GOT THIS VAST OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE POWER WHERE
ACTUALLY TRY AND TREAT WITH PEOPLE AS THEY ARE
SEAT THEN ACTUALLY YOU CAN CREATE A STRONGER AND BETTER SOCIETY AND IF YOU MARRY THIS FACT WITH THE INCREDIBLE ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IN OUR WORLD TODAY I THINK YOU CAN COMPLETELY AS I'VE SAID REMAKE POLITICS REMAKE GOVERNMENT REMAKE
ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ONCE BE LOCKED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS NOW
IN HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION AND POLICING BY SPENDING MORE MONEY YOU CAN ONLY
THAN AS THEY WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE NOW IF YOU
SECRET LOCATIONS FOR A FRACTION OF THAT COST AND WE CAN SEND AND RECEIVE
THAT GOING WITH THE GRAIN OF HUMAN NATURE YOU CAN ACHIEVE SO MUCH MORE
EDUCATION POLICING JUSTICE AND IT WAS A WORLD OF AS I SAY NOT LOCAL
WE HAVE GONE FROM A WORLD OF LOCAL CONTROL THEN WE WENT TO WORLD OF CENTRAL CONTROL AND NOW WE'RE IN A WORLD OF PEOPLE CONTROL LOCAL POWER CENTRAL POWER NOW PEOPLE
A FEW OF THE WAYS THAT LIFE CAN CHANGE AND THIS IS SO OBVIOUS IN WAY BECAUSE YOU THINK ABOUT HOW ALL
MORE ABOUT THAN I DO I THINK THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY REMAKE POLITICS REMAKE GOVERNMENT REMAKE PUBLIC SERVICES AND ACHIEVE
ALL THE INFORMATION AND ALL THE BADGERING FROM A GOVERNMENT CANNOT POSSIBLY ACHIEVE OTHER EXAMPLES ARE RECYCLING WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO RECYCLE MORE HOW DO WE MAKE IT HAPPEN ALL THE PROOF FROM AMERICA IS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU PAY PEOPLE TO
WE COMBINE THE RIGHT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY THE RIGHT POLITICAL THINKING WITH THE INCREDIBLE INFORMATION REVOLUTION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND THAT ALL OF YOU
CAN SEE WHAT CRIMES ARE BEING COMMITTED WHERE WHEN AND BY WHOM AND WE CAN HOLD THE POLICE TO ACCOUNT
IS OF COURSE SHOWBIZ FOR UGLY PEOPLE SO ON THAT BASIS I FEEL LIKE I'VE REALLY ARRIVED
OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS CAN TRANSFORM PEOPLE'S
YEARS AGO WHILE IT STILL TOOK HOURS AND HOURS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS TO TRAVERSE YOUR OWN COUNTRY
NOBLE AND BEAUTIFULLY PUT 40 YEARS AGO AND A BEAUTIFUL DREAM 40 YEARS AGO BUT NOW WITH THE HUGE ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE MASSIVE CHANGES IN BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS WITH
OR AMERICAN POLITICS AND THAT IS WE HAVE RUN OUT OF MONEY WE HAVE VAST BUDGET
LIKE EDUCATION OR HEALTH CARE OR POLICING AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS CHANGE MASSIVELY WE SHOULD BE MAKING THIS CHANGE WITH THE INFORMATION
IT COSTING ANYTHING SO WE'RE NOW LIVING
HE MADE THAT SPEECH WHAT COULD YOU DO TO BUILD THE STRONGER BETTER SOCIETY YOU COULD FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY YOU COULD SERVE IN YOUR COUNTRY'S CIVIL SERVICE BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE INFORMATION
AND THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE ABILITY TO HELP
TO GET PEOPLE TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT WHY IT CUTS FUEL POVERTY IT CUTS THEIR
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET SO ANYONE CAN SEE WHAT THE TERMS ARE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE
HEART THAT I THINK DRIVE A CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY THAT ARE REALLY RELEVANT TO THIS WHOLE DEBATE THE
SCIENTISTS HAD THOUGHT ABOUT ACTUALLY REPLACING
RATS IN THEIR EXPERIMENTS WITH POLITICIANS
AND SOMEONE ASKED WHY AND THEY SAID WELL
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF POLITICIANS
NO ONE REALLY MINDS WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
AND AFTER ALL THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT RATS JUST WON'T DO
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME CONSIDERING AND LEARNING ABOUT OUR PHILOSOPHY I
ON THAT SUNDAY HAS NO RELEVANCE TO LIFE ON MONDAY I'D LIKE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION THERE IS ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY THERE IS THE
NOW IF YOUR PHILOSOPHY ISN'T MAPPED IF YOUR MIND IS NOT MAPPED ON THIS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PHILOSOPHY FORMULA SO TO SPEAK TO LOOK THROUGH AND TRY TO SAY WHERE MIGHT I HAVE SOME OF THESE CONTRADICTIONS THAT ARE LIMITING MY LIFE THEN YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU'RE
THE PHONE RINGS IT'S UNCLE JOHNNY UNCLE JOHNNY WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO HIS MOTHER
COLOR
WHAT'S IMPLIED IN THAT WHAT'S IMPLIED IS THAT TO THEM THE UNIVERSE IS A COMPREHENSIBLE PLACE
AND THAT IF WE CAN LEARN ABOUT IT WE CAN THEN BECOME MASTERS OF OUR OWN DESTINY
AND WE CAN HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY AND EXCITING FUTURE IN FRONT OF US
BUT WHAT
YOU WELL YOUR VALUES OKAY BUT WHERE DO YOUR VALUES COME FROM YOUR VALUES
MAYBE YOU START TO THINK ABOUT GROUPS OF FRIENDS THAT GET TOGETHER ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON OVER SOME CAPPUCCINO WEARING THE JACKETS THAT HAVE LIKE THE SUEDE ARMS ON THE SLEEVES AND WHATEVER THEY'RE TALKING
SO TIMMY ANSWERS THE PHONE HE YELLS MOM IT'S UNCLE
THERE'S THE PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY HAVE CHECKED OUT AND ALL THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS SURVIVE IT THEY'RE NOT REALLY
LIFE YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE IT GETS KIND OF COMPLICATED SUDDENLY WE'RE PULLED IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT WAYS ALL AROUND YOU AND YOU'RE KIND OF STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF IT
DON'T TRY TO BE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT
RICH PEOPLE ARE THIEVES
LIFE ISN'T FAIR
THIS TRANSLATES INTO THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF HUMAN MOTIVATION
WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO ACT
BY CONTRADICTION STARTS TO EAT AWAY AND THE SENSE OF
THEIR LIFE IN ANY OF THE IMPORTANT CATEGORIES OR MAYBE IN ALL OF THE IMPORTANT CATEGORIES OF THEIR LIFE
BEING A BETTER PARENT PRACTICAL WHY WHY WOULD THAT BE HOW CAN PHILOSOPHY BE SO PRACTICAL AND YET MOST PEOPLE DON'T BOTHER TO CONSIDER IT VERY OFTEN
PROVIDES A HUMAN BEING WITH A CODE OF VALUES AND THEREFORE WILL BE A GUIDE TO YOUR ACTIONS IN ESSENCE ETHICS ASKS THE QUESTION SO NOW WHAT DO I DO SO JUST AS MAYBE A FUNDAMENTAL EXAMPLE
ABOUT PUTTING DOLLARS IN YOUR POCKET PRACTICAL I'M TALKING ABOUT
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO PROCESS THAT
THEN YOU HAVE NO WAY AND YOU STAY STUCK
AND IT BECOMES A RECURRING OR A REDUNDANT PATTERN IN LIFE
BUT NOW IMAGINE
WITH THESE CONTRADICTORY DRIVING FORCES INCIDENTALLY YOU'RE ONLY LOOKING AT TWO DIMENSIONS HERE BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIFE YOUR
THE PERSONAL LEVEL WE GET DIVORCED ON THE GEOPOLITICAL LEVEL WE GO TO WAR AND PEOPLE DIE
ACTIONS THAT DICTATE OUR OUTCOMES AND OUR
IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE IN YOUR FINANCIAL LIFE A SPIRITUAL BREAKTHROUGH THAT YOU'VE HAD
WHERE DOES IT COME FROM IT COMES FROM
FINDING THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS YOUR PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISES AND LINING THEM UP IN A WAY THAT INSTEAD OF COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER
THEY SYNERGIZE WITH EACH OTHER
AND THEN THE MAGIC UNFOLDS
WHEN I LOOK AT PHILOSOPHY AND ITS BRANCHES
LETS LOOK AT THE FIVE BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY I'LL PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THE FIRST THREE JUST FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS CONVERSATION
AND TALK ABOUT HOW THEY LINE UP
YOU'LL SEE THAT THESE ARE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF THIS IS A DIFFICULT EXPLORATION THIS ISN'T FOR THE YOU KNOW THE ACADEMIC INTELLECTUAL IN THE IVY TOWERS OF THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES OF THE WORLD
THIS IS THE PRACTICAL USE
OF A TOOL OF ACHIEVEMENT
CALLED PHILOSOPHY
WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST PRACTICAL TOOL FOR HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT
CHOOSE PURPOSE FOR ITS LIFE IF IT COULD IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T LIVE WITH YOU {LG} A
TIME BECOMES A SENSE OF DREAD THAT THE UNIVERSE SUDDENLY BECOMES AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE PLACE THAT THERE'S NO USE IN TRYING AND THAT YOUR ONLY HOPE IS MAYBE TO TRY TO SURVIVE IT WE LEARN THINGS LIKE DON'T BITE OFF MORE THAN YOU
ABILITY TO FILL IN THE BLANK I HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO HAVE A GREAT LOVE RELATIONSHIP I HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO GROW IN MY CAREER I HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO EXPRESS HEALTH WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE JUST FILL IN THE
IN THEIR LIFE THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY POSSESS WHICH PREVENTS THEM FROM DOING MORE IN THEIR LIFE AND IN THE WORLD
PONDERING THE GREATEST QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS
WE'RE ALREADY ARE BASICALLY IN THIS CATEGORY OF LIFE THAT SAYS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THINGS
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED SEEKERS PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING AFTER TRYING TO MAKE BETTER THINGS HAPPEN IN THEIR LIFE THEY HAVE A DESIRE TO WANT
I BELIEVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT THERE AREN'T LAZY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE BECOME PARALYZED AND THEY AREN'T PARALYZED BECAUSE OF INABILITY OR FEAR
OKAY SO THAT'S YOUR VIEW OF REALITY SO WHAT'S THE NEXT BRANCH HOW DO I KNOW IT
HOW DO YOU KNOW BECAUSE I TRIED AND FAILED
SO NOW WHAT SHOULD I DO
THIRD BRANCH
STOP TRYING
CONTRAST THAT WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW THAT SAYS
I HAVE AN
YOU PUT ENERGY INTO THAT SYSTEM WHICH IS WHAT DOING SOMETHING NEW IS PUTTING NEW ENERGY INTO A SYSTEM AND BOOM IT TAKES OFF THAT'S WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS A BREAKTHROUGH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OH THERE WAS BREAKTHROUGH IT COULD BE A BREAKTHROUGH IN YOUR BUSINESS IN
NOW THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT DOING THAT WOULD SOMEHOW MAKE THEIR LIFE
IT STARTS OUT THAT I THINK ALL CHILDREN HAVE THIS SORT OF SIXTH SENSE THIS SENSE OF WONDER
THEY ASK A LOT OF WHY QUESTIONS DON'T THEY
WHY DOES THE SUN RISE IN THE EAST
WHY DO THE STARS SPARKLE IN THE SKY
WHY DO THE LEAVES
FURTHEST CONCLUSION WE COULD CHANGE THE WORLD
EMERGES FROM SOMETHING WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT THAN EVERY OTHER FORM OF ANIMAL ON THE PLANET IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE A PURPOSE A DOG
OUR ARABLE LANDS AND OUR RESOURCES LIKE WATER
ARE SHRINKING NOT GROWING
AND BY 2050 THERE ARE GOING TO BE NINE BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO ASK IS CAN WE USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES
TO MAKE FARMERS MORE EFFICIENT
TO PROVIDE THEM WITH DECISION SUPPORT THINK OF IT
IT'S LIKE AMAZON FOR AG GOOGLE FOR GROWERS
NOT SURE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT MILK PRODUCERS OUT THERE BUT MAYBE WE'LL CALL IT MOOGLE
A COMMUNITY OF INNOVATORS AND DEVELOPERS AND RESEARCHERS AND STUDENTS OF ALL AGES OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND IN OUR CASE FARMERS AND GROWERS
AND THIS COMMUNITY IS WHAT CREATES THE INNOVATION THAT REALLY CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON HARD PROBLEMS THAT
INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES JUST AREN'T GOING TO THEY'RE GOING TO PARTICIPATE
BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT ALONE NONE OF US CAN DO IT ALONE IT TURNS OUT
SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND TO COME JOIN US IN MAKING FARMS SMARTER
COME JOIN THE SMART FARM COMMUNITY BECAUSE ONLY TOGETHER
ARE WE GOING TO ABLE TO FEED THE PLANET
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
AND THEY DO HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHETHER WE COULD USE THIS EXACT SAME TECHNOLOGY TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE WORLD
DATA TO A COMPANY OVER THE INTERMET HOW ABOUT WE MOVE THE
THAT THE FARMERS UNDERTAKING YOU CAN THEN APPLY THE SAME CODE VERY SIMILAR CODE TO THIS DATA AND EXTRACT INSIGHTS ONLY THESE INSIGHTS CAN BE
THEM SUPER EASY TO USE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE SO THAT EVERYONE CAN PARTICIPATE EVERYONE CAN BE PART
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BUY AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO WANT IN THE FUTURE
IT IS PREDICTIVE
THESE INSIGHTS ALLOW THESE COMPANIES TO GIVE US THE APPS AND WEBSITES THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE
BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE THESE COMPANIES WITH OTHER TYPES OF VALUE
OR SELL THEIR DATA AND THEIR INSIGHTS TO INDUSTRY THESE COMPANIES CAN STILL MAKE
THEY KNOW YOU HAVE KIDS YOU SEARCH FOR DIRECTIONS THEY KNOW NOT ONLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING
PORN IS A MOVIE WHERE YOU HAVE THIS SAD LEAD CHARACTER AND THEY GET SCREWED NON STOP FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES
AND THEN AT THE END THEY GET THEIR REWARD
THE CINEMATIC REWARD FOR TRAGEDY IS
LETTERS TO PEOPLE WHO COULD NEVER READ THEM
ALL IN THIS ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND DEVASTATION
AND WHEN YOU GOT DOWN TO IT
REALLY WHAT I'D WRITTEN WAS JUST A LONGER VERSION OF I'M SO SORRY
THIS IS VERY HARD
AND ON THIS DAY
IT STRUCK ME THAT WE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE UNIVERSE TO BRING US SOME AMAZING THING SOME EQUAL YET OPPOSITE EVENT THAT WILL MAKE UP FOR TRAGEDIES
AND WE CANNOT WAIT FOR A GRAND RECKONING THAT WILL EXPLAIN WHAT IS UNEXPLAINABLE
BECAUSE NO GOOD THING CAN BE BIG ENOUGH TO ERASE LOSS FROM WHO WE ARE NOW
NOT EVEN GEORGE CLOONEY
WHO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU HEARD BUT HE GOT MARRIED NOT TO
AT THE HEART OF ANY STORY WHAT YOU FIND
BEYOND THE ATTENTION GRABBING HIGHS AND LOWS
IS THIS BATTLE FOR BALANCE BETWEEN HARD
THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE
IT'S NOT CINEMATIC IT DOESN'T COME WITH A DRAMATIC SCORE OR CHEERING CROWD
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL ABOUT HOW WE SURVIVE IT
I'M SO SORRY
THIS IS VERY HARD
ONE WINTER DAY A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS SITTING AT MY KITCHEN TABLE WRITING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
I WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW PAST THE BARE TREES TOWARD THIS VAST EXPANSE OF PEAKS AND VALLEYS IN THE DISTANCE
IT'S THIS AMAZING VIEW THAT I FORGET ABOUT COMPLETELY WHEN EVERYTHING IS IN BLOOM
I DECIDED TO ALLOW MYSELF TO SAY WHAT IS TRUE THIS IS VERY HARD
I DON'T KNOW WHY SO I DECIDED TO STOP SAYING THIS HAPPENED FOR A REASON THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS HAS TO BE
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE GEORGE CLOONEY AS MY BOYFRIEND
SO I FELL INTO THIS TRAP FOR A WHILE OF WAITING FOR WHAT COMES NEXT
I MADE VISION BOARDS I READ SELF HELP BOOKS
I WENT TO THERAPY
AND I TRIED TO LEARN MY LESSON
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR OF COURSE WAS SOMETHING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
SOME EQUAL YET COMPLETELY OPPOSITE REACTION THAT COULD BRING A TRAUMATIC STORY TO AN END
I HAD THE IDEA THAT MAYBE THIS PHASE OF TRAGEDY COULD BE OVER IF ONLY SOME HAPPILY EVER AFTER CAME ALONG
I NEEDED ANSWERS AND I MADE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS MY FULL TIME JOB
I LOOKED FOR ANSWERS IN THE SUICIDE NOTE MY EX HUSBAND HAD WRITTEN ONLY MOMENTS BEFORE WE WERE IN THE GARAGE
AND IT DIDN'T GIVE ME THE ANSWERS I NEEDED OR WANTED
IS THE ENDING BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THE ENDING EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY I KNOW THIS NOW
WE WANT THE CINEMATIC CLIMAX
TO BE THE STRUCTURE OF OUR OWN DIFFICULT STORIES
SO I ENTERTAINED FANTASIES ABOUT THINGS THAT COULD SAVE ME
BECAUSE I FELT I NEEDED SAVING
CINEMATIC HAPPY ENDING SAVING
I WANTED THE THINGS PEOPLE PROMISED ME IN THEIR MESSAGES OF CONDOLENCE
THE THINGS WE SAY WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
THIS HAPPENED FOR A REASON
YOU WILL FIND HAPPINESS AGAIN
YOU DESERVE SOMETHING WONDERFUL
URBAN HABITATS ARE OUT OF BALANCE CLIMATE CHANGE TOGETHER WITH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TROUBLES ARE HAVING AN IMPACT THEY'RE ADDING UP AND STRESSING OUT CITIES AND US THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN
RELATIONSHIPS THE BUILDING HAS A POSITIVE SOCIAL EFFECT ON THE
BE A PLACE FOR NEIGHBORS TO MEET EACH OTHER AND TO GET TO KNOW THE OFFICERS AND VICE
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR GET MONEY OUT OF AN ATM
IT'S BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER SO I'VE SHOWN HOW ARCHITECTURE CAN CONNECT PEOPLE ON THIS KIND OF HORIZONTAL CAMPUS
FIELD THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER ARCHITECTURE CAN EVEN DO ANYTHING TO IMPROVE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT I BELIEVE
YEARS AGO IN CHICAGO THEY STARTED TO REPLACE OLD POLICE
A RELATIONSHIP BUILDER WHEN YOU THINK OF A RELATIONSHIP BUILDER DON'T YOU JUST AUTOMATICALLY THINK ARCHITECT PROBABLY
SPACE CAN HELP BUILD STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS THE PROJECTS I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TODAY USE THE IDEA OF BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS AS THE KEY DRIVER FOR
THEY'VE ASKED US TO EXPAND THE COURTS AND BUILD A PARK ON THE SITE
ECOLOGISTS DON'T JUST LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL SPECIES ON THEIR OWN THEY LOOK
ANOTHER PART OF ARCHITECTURE I MEAN URBAN
WAS VERY INTERESTED IN SOCIAL NIGHTS BECAUSE I HAVE TWO
AND THEN I MEET PEOPLE BECAUSE THE HISTORY OF EVERYONE IS ALSO MEETING PEOPLE
THE INVESTOR TO INVEST WITH LIGHT IN THIS AREA
NIGHT AND I BECOME TO LOVE IT THEN I DISCOVER ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING OF THE NIGHTS THE SOCIAL NIGHTS
MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS IN MY STUDIO IN BRUSSELS IN
LIKE IN FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE BUT THEY ARE IN THE CENTER SO WE START TO MEET PEOPLE THEN
THEN I WAS ASKING MYSELF
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT HERE YOU HAVE
LIVING OF THOSE PEOPLE SO I WAS SO UPSET WITH THESE LINKS BETWEEN SAFETY LIGHT AND HOW
BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A VIDEO THAT EXPLAINS VERY WELL THE
SOCIOLOGISTS BUT ALSO IT'S A HISTORY OF MOMENTS IN 1996 I WENT TO A CONFERENCE IN
AND IN LONDON WELL IN LONDON IT WAS NEIGHBOURHOOD IN THE
LUXURY IN LONDON SO WE WORKED A LOT WITH THIS KIND OF SITUATION
DOING SOCIAL RESEARCH
ALL THE WEEK
AND OF COURSE ARTICULATING LIGHT
BECAUSE IT IS THE MATERIAL THE TEXTURE
THEY LIVE AND THEN I WAS ASKING
AND I WANT TO END WITH THIS SENTENCE OF DON DELILLO BECAUSE I THINK THAT
I AM MORE IN THE MORNING I WAKE UP AT SIX IN THE MORNING I WORK VERY WELL BUT WITH MY LAB I DISCOVERED
4 DAYS WORKING IN ONE PLACE AND TRYING AT THE END TO
PRACTICE AND ACADEMIC WORLD AND IT'S NOT SO
WE TRY TO ANSWER
AND THE SOCIOLOGISTS HAVE A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION THEY ASK TO THE PARTICIPANTS WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PLACE
IN THE BEGINNING OF THE WORKSHOP AND AFTER THEY
A GOOD LIGHT THEN MY
THE WAY OF LIVING OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT I START TO STUDY IT
THEY ASK DO YOU LIKE TO BE AT NIGHT
STORYTELLING IS SOMETHING THAT'S EXISTED SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL AND YOU KNOW THAT STORIES HAVE BEEN AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WAY OF DELIVERING THOUGHTS AND
EARLY FORMS WERE A TWO STEP PROCESS SO WHEN SOMEONE TOLD A STORY TO
FELT
INSTEAD OF JUST
GIVING YOU ALL STATISTICS I WOULD TAKE YOU ALL DOWN
A ROAD WHICH FEW PEOPLE TRAVELED
THE ONES WHO HAVE SEEN LAKSHMI IT
IS AN EXTREMELY HARD FILM TO WATCH
AND I AM GOING TO ADDRESS THE WOMEN MORE THAN
THE MEN
IT IS
EXTREMELY DISTURBING LIKE
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID THERE ARE MANY
CHUNKS OF THE
FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS THEY WALKED
THAT
HE COULDN'T FATHOM HOW ONE HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE THAT KIND OF HATE FOR ANOTHER
WITHOUT ACTUALLY KNOWING WHAT THEY DID
YOU KNOW HE JUST SAID THIS IN BROAD STROKES AND HE SAID WHEN YOU HAVE THE TIME I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO VISIT SO
EVENTUALLY
OUT
OF CURIOSITY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I WENT DOWN THERE
HE RUNS A SMALL RESCUE SHELTER OUTSIDE ONGOLE IN ANDHRA PRADHESH
AND I WENT THERE THERE WERE ABOUT 45 WOMEN AND THERE WERE ABOUT 25 CHILDREN
IN THE PLACE SO I GOT TALKING WITH THESE WOMEN
AND WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS WAS SOMETHING THAT PRETTY MUCH CHANGED MY LIFE
WHEN
YOU ARE IN THE COMFORT OF YOUR HOMES I'M NO DIFFERENT AND YOU SORT OF CLICK IMAGES ON THE INTERNET
YOU DO A LITTLE SCROLLING
AND THEN YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE OR IF YOU ARE SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS THEN YOU SAY OK I AM GOING TO FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE VERY ESSENTIAL
BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY STAND ACROSS FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS GONE THROUGH
STUFF THAT
I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE
TALE AFTER TALE OF
ABSOLUTE INHUMANITY EMERGED
I KEPT LISTENING TO THEM AND AT ONE POINT YOU SORT OF GROW NUMB WITH YOU KNOW THE TALES THAT YOU ARE HEARING
BUT AT THE BACK OF MY MIND I KEPT SAYING OK I NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS I NEED TO SHED THE SPOTLIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS THE TOPIC I CARE ABOUT
BUT WE FILMMAKERS ARE VERY FICKLE THERE'S THAT MOMENTARY BURST OF OH WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING THEN YOU GO BACK AND THE NEXT CHEQUE IS CUT AND YOU MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE
SO THIS WAS NO DIFFERENT
EXCEPT
I MET THIS AMAZING GIRL
AND IN A VERY QUIET VOICE
YOU
KNOW SHE MUMBLED SOMETHING I
THOUGHT I DIDN'T HEAR IT CORRECTLY SO I ASKED THE GUY I SAID DID I HEAR WHAT SHE IS SAYING HE SAID YEAH
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW COURAGEOUS THIS GIRL IS
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE IN THE STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH TO TAKE HER TRAFFICKERS TO COURT
THIS IS SOMETHING THEY HAD
BEEN THEY WOULD RESCUE THESE GIRLS BRING THEM TO THE SHELTER
AFTER FEW MONTHS OF SETTLING THEM
TRYING TO HEAL THEIR WOUNDS BOTH PSYCHOLOGICALLY MENTALLY PHYSICALLY
THEY WOULD TRY TO GET THESE GIRLS TO GO TO COURT TO STAND AS WITNESSES
AND NONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE THE COURAGE BECAUSE OF ALL THE SOCIAL ISSUES THEY WERE THREATENED BY THE MAFIA
AND ALL THIS THIS GIRL THIS UNASSUMING QUIET LITTLE GIRL WHO JUST STOOD THERE IN A CORNER
HAD ACTUALLY DONE IT AND THAT WAS THE FIRST CASE IN THE STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH
AND THAT SET A PRECEDENT
AND THEN BY LAST COUNT THERE WERE 94 TRAFFICKERS WHO HAD
BEEN JAILED YEAH I MEAN THIS IS A STORY OF HEROISM AND I SAID OK THAT'S MY HOOK
LIKE I KEEP SAYING WE'VE BECOME SO NUMB IN TODAY'S TIME ESPECIALLY TO IMAGES I'M TALKING ABOUT THE POWER OF IMAGES TO CHANGE OUR THOUGHT PROCESSES AND SORT OF INSTIL AMAZING IDEAS BUT WE BECOME SO NUMB TO IMAGES
THAT
LIKE THIS AND
TOLD ARJUNA WHAT DHARMA WAS
THINK ARJUNA WOULD HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP
TAKE IT ON TO THE BATTLE OF KURUKSHETRA YOU HAVE
A BLOOD STREWN BATTLEFIELD
YOU HAVE BROTHERS FIGHTING EACH OTHER
YOU HAVE ARJUNA A TRULY CINEMATIC MOMENT
PUTTING AN ARROW INTO HIS BOW BEING ABOUT TO UNLEASH IT OVERCOME BY ANGUISH AND BOOM
WE HAVE THE CONCEPT OF DHARMA
SO STORIES HAVE CONTINUOUSLY DONE THIS
THEY HAVE USED IMAGERY
TO GET IDEAS ACROSS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CINEMA AND MOST OF THE EARLIER FORMS OF STORYTELLING IS VERY SIMPLE
HAVE YOUR
EYES AVERTED FROM THE SCREEN
AGAIN THE REASON IS SIMPLE
IF I SHOW YOU THE JOURNEY THAT ONE LITTLE GIRL
TOOK
I THINK I CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN JUST THROWING YOU KNOW EVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS TRAILER IT'S SAID 44000 CHILDREN ARE ABDUCTED 3 MILLION SEX WORKERS THESE ARE JUST NUMBERS ALL IRRELEVANT
AND
THAT'S HOW THE JOURNEY OF LASKHMI STARTED
NOW WITH LAKSHMI
MY INTENTION BOTH AS A PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS AT THE BOX OFFICE I WANT THIS FILM TO TRAVEL
SO WHAT I HAVE DONE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS FILM
IS
WAY BEFORE THE RELEASE WE STARTED SHOWING THE FILM AROUND COLLEGE CAMPUSES
AND
IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE IN MY LIFE
BECAUSE THE RESPONSES THAT WE GOT THE KIND OF SPREAD OF AWARENESS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE REASON THAT I ATTACKED THE COLLEGES WAS VERY
SIMPLE YOU GUYS ARE LITERALLY THE LAST STAGE BEFORE
TOTAL CYNICISM SETS IN
YOU ARE STILL NOT JADED TO REJECT EVERY GOOD IDEA
AT LEAST YOU WILL CONSIDER THE IDEA AND
IF BY CHANCE YOU END UP LIKING IT
CHAMPION IT
AND THAT'S WHY I STARTED TAKING IT TO COLLEGE CAMPUSES
IN ADDITION WE STARTED TALKING TO NGOS TO TRY AND SCREEN
THIS
INITIALLY I WAS LITTLE HESITANT BECAUSE I FELT THAT GIRLS WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THEIR OWN HORROR DEPICTED ON THE SCREEN SO WAS LITTLE HESITANT BUT THE RESPONSE THAT I'VE GOTTEN FROM LOT OF THE NGOS IS THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY INSPIRE MANY MORE LAKSHMIS
SO THIS NEEDS TO BE SHOWN
SO
ANOTHER BURST OF ENTHUSIASM
AND THE KEY THING
WITH THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN
I HAVE NEVER FOUND A MORE POTENT TOOL
I USED TO JUST CONSTANTLY PASS IT OFF AS OH THIS IS GOOD ENTERTAINMENT THIS IS GOOD ENTERTAINMENT BUT NEVER ONCE REALIZED THAT WHEN YOU SIT IN THE DARK HALL
AND THESE IMAGES PLAY OUT
WHAT EXACTLY GOES ON IN YOUR HEAD IS SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN TRULY ANALYZED AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING AND STUDYING
I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A WONDERFUL LITTLE ANECDOTE THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY WE SCREENED THE FILM IN PALM SPRINGS AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE REACT TO THE FILM
I HAD
MANY
AND
I AM USING THE WORD CAREFULLY DISTRAUGHT WOMEN
AND YOU KNOW SAY THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THE SPOTLIGHT ON A DIFFICULT TOPIC AND BLAH BLAH BLAH
BUT THERE WAS ONE WOMAN
WHO JUST STOOD NEXT TO ME AND SHE COULDN'T TALK
AND SHE JUST KEPT SOBBING BUT SHE KEPT SAYING ONE THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE KEPT SAYING I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
AND FOR ME THAT WAS IT I WAS LIKE I THINK THAT'S WHAT
A GOOD FILM CAN DO GOOD IS SUBJECTIVE
I'LL REPHRASE IT THAT'S WHAT I THINK A FILM CAN DO
WHICH IS INSPIRE THE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
THANK YOU
WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING
HE PUTS WORDS ON A PAGE A READER READS IT FORMS AN IMAGE
DRAMA TOOK IT ONE STEP FURTHER
TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THOSE THINGS BUT STILL THE PERSON HAD TO VISUALIZE THE PLACE
AND FINALLY CAME MOVIES
TODAY AS WE KNOW IT
BY AND LARGE IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT FORM OF STORYTELLING
BECAUSE IT WORKS WITH THE WAY OUR BRAIN IS WIRED
WHICH WAS THE EARLIEST FORM A VERBAL FORM THE LISTENER HAD TO LISTEN AND THEN FORM AN IMAGE IN HIS OR HER HEAD WE MOVED TO BOOKS I SEE
IT MAY NOT EFFECT SWEEPING SOCIAL CHANGES IT HAS THE POWER TO TELL STORIES AND EVEN PLANT IMAGES IN YOUR HEAD
QU'RAN RAMAYANA THESE ARE ALL GREAT STORIES I MEAN IMAGINE IF KRISHNA
THE GROUND
BUT DOR
AGAIN TRIED TO DO THE THING OF BREAKING THE BOLLYWOOD PORTRAYAL OF STRONG WOMEN WHICH IS TO PORTRAY THEM AS THESE SHRILL SCREAMING VIXENS STANDING AND SCREAMING AT THE INJUSTICE PERPETRATED BY SOCIETY
AND IT IS IRONIC BECAUSE THEY WERE REINFORCING THE SAME GENDER INEQUALITY THAT THEY WERE FIGHTING AGAINST
AND
WITH DOR
AGAIN IT WAS VERY HUMBLING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF THE OFFSHOOTS THAT IT HAD MY MOST MEMORABLE ONE WAS THE FACT THAT WHEN THE FILM SCREENED AT THE SMITHSONIAN IN WASHINGTON D C
THIS
TEAR EYED WOMAN WALKED UP TO ME
AND SAID
THAT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LESBIAN LOVE STORY THAT I'VE EVER SEEN
I AM SERIOUS AND I TOOK THAT AS A COMPLIMENT AGAIN NEVER INTENDED
BUT YOU KNOW
PEOPLE READ WHAT THEY WANT FROM FILM
FINALLY IT BRINGS ME TO LAKSHMI
WITH LAKSHMI
I ACTUALLY HAD
A VERY SPECIFIC AGENDA NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I'VE SAID ENTERTAINMENT FIRST
STORY FIRST MESSAGE LATER
WITH LAKSHMI I ACTUALLY TRIED TO APPROACH IT FROM THE REVERSE
HISTORY IS PEPPERED WITH EXAMPLES YOU HAVE THE
THERE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO EAT BEES GET ALL OF THE PROTEIN THEY NEED IN THEIR DIET FROM POLLEN AND ALL OF THE CARBOHYDRATES THEY NEED FROM
I GOT DRAWN INTO THE HONEYBEE WORLD COMPLETELY BY A FLUKE I WAS 18 YEARS OLD AND BORED AND I PICKED UP A BOOK IN THE LIBRARY ON BEES AND I SPENT THE NIGHT READING IT I HAD NEVER
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO A BEE TO HAVE A VIRUS
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN I HAVE A VIRUS THE FLU
AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR ME TO GET TO THE GROCERY STORE TO GET GOOD NUTRITION
BUT WHAT IF I LIVED IN A FOOD DESERT
AND WHAT IF I HAD TO TRAVEL A LONG DISTANCE TO GET TO THE GROCERY STORE AND I FINALLY GOT MY WEAK BODY OUT THERE AND I CONSUMED IN MY FOOD ENOUGH OF A PESTICIDE A NEUROTOXIN
THAT I COULDN'T FIND MY WAY HOME
AND THIS
WE'VE BEEN STUDYING RESINS THAT BEES COLLECT FROM PLANTS SO BEES FLY TO SOME
MY LAB WE STUDY HOW BEES KEEP THEMSELVES HEALTHY FOR EXAMPLE WE
AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE BEES HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF DISEASES AND PARASITES PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE FOR BEES IS THIS
HONEYBEES TEND TO BE THE CHARISMATIC REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE OTHER 19900 PLUS SPECIES BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HONEYBEES THAT DRAWS PEOPLE INTO THEIR WORLD
THAT PROPOLIS IS A NATURAL DISINFECTANT IT'S A NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC IT KILLS OFF BACTERIA AND MOLDS AND OTHER
BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY ELIMINATING MANY OF THE FLOWERING PLANTS THAT BEES NEED FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AND THESE MONOCULTURES EXTEND EVEN TO CROPS THAT
AND SEARCH FOR FLOWERS THAT ARE NATIVE TO YOUR AREA AND PLANT
STARTED USING SYNTHETIC FERTILIZERS CLOVER AND ALFALFA ARE
SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES WE'VE BEEN HARVESTING PROPOLIS OUT OF BEE COLONIES FOR HUMAN MEDICINE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW GOOD IT WAS FOR THE
WAR II
WE STARTED USING PESTICIDES ON A LARGE SCALE AND THIS BECAME NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE MONOCULTURES THAT PUT OUT A FEAST
FOR CROP PESTS
RECENTLY RESEARCHERS FROM PENN STATE UNIVERSITY HAVE STARTED LOOKING AT THE PESTICIDE RESIDUE
SO HOW THEY COME TO COLLECTIVE DECISIONS AND HOW THEY ALLOCATE THEIR TASKS AND DIVIDE THEIR LABOR HOW THEY COMMUNICATE WHERE THE FLOWERS ARE
SMALL COUNTERMEASURE TO A BIG HUGE PROBLEM JUST GO PLANT FLOWERS
BUT WHEN BEES HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD NUTRITION
WE HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD NUTRITION THROUGH THEIR POLLINATION SERVICES
AND WHEN BEES HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD NUTRITION THEY'RE BETTER ABLE TO ENGAGE THEIR OWN NATURAL
THERE WERE THESE PEOPLE THESE BEEKEEPERS THAT LOVED THEIR BEES LIKE THEY WERE FAMILY AND WHEN I PUT DOWN THE BOOK I KNEW I HAD TO SEE THIS FOR MYSELF SO
IT'S HOPEFUL EVERY ONE OF YOU OUT THERE CAN HELP BEES IN TWO VERY DIRECT AND EASY
A YEAR THAT'S MS YES THIRTY PERCENT YEAR CA THIRTY PERCENT A YEAR MS BUT THEN BEEKEEPERS ARE ABLE TO DIVIDE THEIR COLONIES AND SO
OF OUR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS AND CROPS LIKE ALFALFA HAY THAT FEED OUR FARM ANIMALS MORE THAN
WE NEED TO DIVERSIFY OUR FARMS WE NEED TO PLANT
20 YEARS AGO WE WERE AT A 15 PERCENT LOSS SO IT'S GETTING PRECARIOUS CA THAT'S
REALLY WRONG IN OUR COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE IN REALLY
SOCIETY WHERE EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
SOLUTION AN EMERGENT PROPERTY THAT'S MUCH GREATER THAN THE MERE SUM OF OUR INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
THE GREENHOUSE TO POLLINATE THE TOMATOES BECAUSE THEY GET MUCH MORE EFFICIENT POLLINATION WHEN IT'S DONE NATURALLY AND THEY GET BETTER QUALITY TOMATOES
IS A NEW CLASS OF INSECTICIDES IT MOVES THROUGH THE PLANT SO THAT A CROP PEST A LEAF EATING INSECT WOULD TAKE A BITE OF THE PLANT AND GET A LETHAL DOSE AND DIE IF ONE OF THESE NEONICS WE
PLANTING MORE CROPS THAT NEED THEM THERE HAS BEEN A 300
THAT THEY HAVE RELIED ON FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS SO
WE NEED A BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY OF FLOWERS THAT BLOOMS OVER THE ENTIRE GROWING SEASON FROM SPRING TO
HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO CONTAMINATE HUMANS ONE OF THESE CLASS OF INSECTICIDES THE
OF THEIR COLLECTIVE SOCIAL BEHAVIORS ARE MINDBLOWING MY PERSONAL FAVORITE AND ONE THAT I'VE STUDIED FOR MANY YEARS IS THEIR SYSTEM OF HEALTHCARE SO BEES HAVE SOCIAL HEALTHCARE
OF THE WORLD WHERE THERE ARE NO BEES OR WHERE THEY PLANT VARIETIES THAT ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE TO BEES
BE THE DRIVER OF LARGE SCALE CHANGE ON
BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY GOOD ABOUT TALKING ABOUT ALL THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US LIKE FOR ME I WANT TO DIE PEACEFULLY IN MY SLEEP LIKE MY GRANDFATHER DID
INTO A MAJOR SURGERY THAT TELLS US IN QUITE UNCERTAIN TERMS THE THREE BASIC OPTIONS SHOULD SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPEN
STOPPING EATING AND DRINKING NOW SOME PEOPLE AREN'T AFFORDED THE OPTION OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTED DYING BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL IN 45 STATES
OH SO THAT'S HOW I GO WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T NEED A WITCH'S GLASS EYEBALL TO TELL YOU HOW YOU WERE GOING TO
IT IN A WITCH'S GLASS EYEBALL GOD I LOVE THAT MOVIE
ONE KID SEES A VISION OF HIS DEATH WHEN HE FALLS OFF OF A LADDER AS AN OLD MAN AND THAT'S HOW HE DIES
ANOTHER ONE DIES FROM POOPING TOO HARD
OPTION FOUR NO CARE AT ANY TIME YOU CAN REFUSE MEDICAL TREATMENT IT'S UP TO YOU OPTION FIVE
THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE MODEL IS THAT IT'S RESPECTFUL AND COGNIZANT OF EVERY STATE'S LAWS AND ANYONE WHO TRIES TO SUBVERT THOSE LAWS IS REALLY JEOPARDIZING THE WHOLE MODEL AND EVERYONE ELSE'S CHANCE OF USING IT
BUT THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO I THINK USED SOMETHING LIKE THE CHOICE MODEL WHICH IS BRITTANY MAYNARD WHO HAD A TERMINAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS SHE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA AND SHE MOVED TO OREGON WHERE PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING WAS LEGAL
AND SHE DIED PEACEFULLY TRANQUILLY THE WAY THAT SHE WANTED
THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A TIME WHEN A DOCTOR CAN SAY TO A PATIENT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE MAYBE HERE'S THE
HIGH HEALTH LITERACY
THOSE WHO KNOW THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO ASK
AND THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE ON A REGULAR BASIS SO DOCTORS AND MAYBE NPR'S TERRY GROSS
BUT FOR THE REST OF US WE'RE LUCKY IF WE GET A FORM TO
THIS IS BASICALLY AN INFORMED CONSENT FORM THAT TELLS PEOPLE THE ADVANTAGES AND THE DISADVANTAGES OF NINE DIFFERENT DYING OPTIONS THAT SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO THEM
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T NORMALLY GIVEN CHOICE WHO AM I KIDDING IT'S FOR EVERYONE CANDY FOR ALL
PERSON ASLEEP UNTIL THEY DIE OR AT LEAST UNTIL THE END OF THEIR BROTHER'S BAR MITZVAH {LG} OPTION SEVEN PHYSICIAN AID IN DYING CURRENTLY LEGAL IN FIVE WHOLE BIG STATES AND NOW CANADA
ON THIS WEBSITE IT'S COLORFUL IT'S EASY TO TRANSLATE INTO SPANISH FRENCH MANDARIN CHINESE ANY LANGUAGE IT'S WRITTEN AT AN EIGHT GRADE READING LEVEL
VERY SIMPLE AND TODAY JUNE 25TH
BY ONE
THE NINE OPTIONS OF THE CHOICE MODEL
OPTION ONE
ALL AVAILABLE MEASURES THIS INCLUDES FEEDING TUBES BREATHING MACHINES MEDICATIONS SURGERY CHEMOTHERAPY ANYTHING TO TRY TO KEEP YOU ALIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
SO ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS BETWEEN LIKE 40 AND 68 PERCENT OF US {LG}
THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT OR CAN NO LONGER COMMUNICATE OR SELF ADMINISTER THE DRUG THEMSELVES OPTION NINE
I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE THE TIME TO START THE CONVERSATION KNOW YOUR OPTIONS SHARE YOUR CHOICE THANK YOU
WE MUST DO BETTER FOR THE SAKE OF PEOPLE WHO MAY FACE THE END OF LIFE ONE DAY
THANKS SO THEY USE VSED AS A WAY OF SUBVERTING THE SYSTEM IT CAN BE BRUTAL
AND ESPECIALLY EARLY ON IT TAKES AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WILLPOWER
BUT AS WE NEARLY END OUR LIFE WE TEND NOT TO FEEL HUNGRY OR THIRSTY ANYWAY
OUR BODIES DON'T DESIRE AND WE DON'T WANT FOOD OR DRINK
NOWHERE SHOULD WE INDULGE THE SOUL MORE THAN IN DYING LET IT GO AS IT LISTS
IF IT CRAVES THE SWORD
OR THE NOOSE
OR SOME POTION THAT CONSTRICTS ITS VEINS ON WITH IT LET IT BREAK THE CHAIN OF SLAVERY
{LG} THERE ARE MORE THAN 1 5 MILLION IPHONE APPS THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM AND OF COURSE YOU CAN CHOOSE TO USE THE OXFORD COMMA {LG}
THEN YOU ARE GIVEN A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION BY YOUR DOCTOR WHICH YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE YOURSELF AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SELF ADMINISTER THE DRUG IT'S NICE TO MAKE IT SO EASY
OF OUR MODERN AMERICAN MEDICAL SYSTEM SO PROVE IT
AT THE END OF LIFE WHEN CHOICE IS REALLY IMPORTANT LET'S GIVE EVERYONE EQUAL ACCESS TO EQUAL OPTIONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS
JUST AS I CHOOSE SHIP TO SAIL IN
OR HOUSE TO LIVE IN
SO I CHOOSE A DEATH FOR MY PASSAGE FROM LIFE
WE'RE LAUNCHING WEBSITE THAT OUTLINES ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS IN DETAIL I CALL IT THECHOICEMODEL COM I'M NOT VERY GOOD WITH NAMING THINGS
BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL
BUT THERE ARE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
WHERE ALL OF THESE OPTIONS HAVE BEEN DECRIMINALIZED AND DESTIGMATIZED
CANADA MOST RECENTLY
IF YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY SUICIDAL
THAT IT MIGHT PUSH THEM TO COMMIT SUICIDE WELL YOU'RE WRONG BECAUSE OF RESEARCH AND SCIENCE LOTS OF IT INCLUDING FROM THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION
AS IT IS SOME PEOPLE KNOW THE OPTIONS AFFORDED TO THEM WHEN IT COMES TO END OF LIFE CARE
INTERVENTIONS THIS INCLUDES LESS INVASIVE MEASURES LIKE
SOME MEDICATIONS OR VERY SMALL SURGERIES
OPTION THREE
COMFORT CARE ONLY
THIS IS WHERE WE USE MEDICATIONS TO KEEP PEOPLE COMFORTABLE AND PAIN FREE BUT NOTHING MORE
SO THOSE THE THREE OPTIONS THAT SOME PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT
WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT AS MUCH
BUT IT DOES TELL YOU THOSE NINE OPTIONS SO I GUESS YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT THOSE OPTIONS ARE LET'S TALK ABOUT THEM
A PERSON'S LIFE SHOULD SATISFY OTHERS AS WELL THEIR DEATH ONLY THEMSELVES AND WHATEVER SORT THEY LIKE IS BEST
AID IN DYING OR PAD IS
WHERE YOU HAVE A TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS
AND A PROGNOSIS OF SIX MONTHS OR LESS YOU ARE COMPETENT AND CAN CLEARLY AND CONSISTENTLY COMMUNICATE YOUR WISHES
AND YOU CAN DO A ONE HANDED HAND STAND
NOW REMEMBER
THE FORM OUTLINES THE ADVANTAGES AND THE DISADVANTAGES OF EACH OPTION NOT AN EASY TASK ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT NEUTRALLY
IT'S REALLY BECOME MY LIFE'S WORK
MY DEATH'S WORK WHATEVER
OPTION TWO
YOU YOU'RE FINE
YOU DON'T EVEN REALLY NEED TO LISTEN TO THIS TED TALK IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STICK AROUND FOR JOVAN'S THOUGH IT'S GOING
TO BE GREAT DO YOU REMEMBER THE MOVIE BIG FISH
THERE'S THIS GREAT SCENE IN IT WHERE THE KIDS ALL SEE A VISION OF THEIR OWN DEATHS IN THE FUTURE
NOT SCREAMING LIKE THE PASSENGERS IN HIS CAR YOU KNOW
IDEAS LIKE INFORMED CONSENT AND AUTONOMY AND THE PATIENT VOICE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
NARRATIVE EQUATING WESTERN DEMAND AND CHINESE SUFFERING IS APPEALING ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN MANY OF US ALREADY FEEL GUILTY ABOUT OUR IMPACT ON THE WORLD BUT IT'S ALSO INACCURATE AND DISRESPECTFUL
CHEN YING
WHEN I WENT HOME FOR THE NEW YEAR EVERYONE SAID I HAD CHANGED
THEY ASKED ME WHAT DID YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH
I TOLD THEM THAT I STUDIED AND WORKED HARD
IF YOU TELL THEM MORE THEY WON'T UNDERSTAND ANYWAY
WU CHUNMING
EVEN IF I MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IT WON'T SATISFY ME
JUST TO MAKE MONEY IS NOT ENOUGH MEANING IN LIFE
XIAO JIN
NOW AFTER I GET OFF WORK I STUDY ENGLISH BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE OUR CUSTOMERS WON'T BE ONLY CHINESE SO WE MUST LEARN MORE LANGUAGES
ALL OF THESE SPEAKERS BY THE WAY ARE YOUNG WOMEN 18 OR 19 YEARS OLD
CLASSIC
IN
1941 THE BURNISHED PATINA OF AN ALL AMERICAN BASEBALL GLOVE
INSPIRED THE FOUNDER OF COACH TO CREATE A NEW COLLECTION OF HANDBAGS FROM THE SAME LUXURIOUSLY SOFT GLOVED HAND LEATHER
SIX SKILLED LEATHERWORKERS CRAFTED 12 SIGNATURE HANDBAGS
WITH PERFECT PROPORTIONS AND A TIMELESS FLAIR
THEY WERE FRESH FUNCTIONAL AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE ADORED THEM
A NEW AMERICAN CLASSIC WAS BORN
EVEN TELL ME WHAT SHE DID ON THE FACTORY FLOOR ALL SHE COULD DO WAS PARROT A GARBLED ABBREVIATION IN A LANGUAGE SHE DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
RARELY SPOKE ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THEY MADE AND THEY OFTEN HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY EXPLAINING WHAT EXACTLY THEY DID
WHEN I ASKED LU QINGMIN THE YOUNG WOMAN I GOT TO KNOW BEST
WHAT EXACTLY SHE DID ON THE FACTORY FLOOR
SHE SAID SOMETHING TO ME IN CHINESE THAT SOUNDED LIKE QIU XI
OLDER SISTER'S FRIEND GOT MARRIED SHE BROUGHT A HANDBAG ALONG AS A WEDDING PRESENT ANOTHER TIME AFTER MIN HAD ALREADY LEFT THE HANDBAG FACTORY HER YOUNGER SISTER CAME TO VISIT BRINGING TWO COACH SIGNATURE HANDBAGS AS GIFTS
AT NIGHT DURING THE WEEKENDS THEY'LL TAKE A COMPUTER CLASS THEY'LL TAKE AN ENGLISH CLASS AND LEARN REALLY REALLY RUDIMENTARY THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE HOW TO TYPE A DOCUMENT IN WORD OR HOW TO
WORKERS ARE NOT FORCED INTO FACTORIES BECAUSE OF OUR INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR IPODS
THEY CHOOSE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN ORDER TO EARN MONEY TO LEARN NEW SKILLS AND TO SEE THE WORLD
IN THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT GLOBALIZATION WHAT'S BEEN MISSING IS THE VOICES OF THE WORKERS THEMSELVES
HERE ARE FEW
BAO YONGXIU
MY MOTHER TELLS ME TO COME HOME AND GET MARRIED
BUT IF I MARRY NOW BEFORE I HAVE FULLY DEVELOPED MYSELF
I CAN ONLY MARRY AN ORDINARY WORKER
SO I'M NOT IN A RUSH
MARX SAW THIS AS THE TRAGEDY OF CAPITALISM
THE ALIENATION OF THE WORKER FROM THE PRODUCT OF HIS LABOR
UNLIKE SAY A TRADITIONAL MAKER OF SHOES OR CABINETS
THE WORKER IN AN INDUSTRIAL FACTORY HAS NO CONTROL
NO PLEASURE AND NO TRUE SATISFACTION OR UNDERSTANDING IN HER OWN WORK
BUT LIKE SO MANY THEORIES THAT MARX ARRIVED AT SITTING IN THE READING ROOM OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM
HE GOT THIS ONE WRONG
JUST BECAUSE A PERSON SPENDS HER TIME MAKING A PIECE OF SOMETHING
DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHE BECOMES THAT A PIECE OF SOMETHING
WHAT SHE DOES WITH THE MONEY SHE EARNS
WHAT SHE LEARNS IN THAT PLACE AND HOW IT CHANGES HER
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MATTER
IT WAS DAWNING ON ME THAT THESE HANDBAGS WERE MADE BY THEIR FACTORY AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS AUTHENTIC
OF THE WORLD PERSISTS AND OUR TENDENCY TO SEE THE WORKERS AS FACELESS MASSES TO IMAGINE THAT WE CAN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE REALLY THINKING
HOME SHE GAVE ME A PRESENT
A COACH BRAND CHANGE PURSE WITH BROWN LEATHER TRIM
I THANKED HER ASSUMING IT WAS FAKE LIKE ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE FOR SALE IN DONGGUAN
AFTER WE GOT HOME MIN GAVE HER MOTHER ANOTHER PRESENT A PINK DOONEY AMP BOURKE HANDBAG
AND A FEW NIGHTS LATER HER SISTER WAS SHOWING OFF A MAROON LESPORTSAC
SHOULDER BAG
MAKES IS NEVER THE POINT
AND THE WORKERS COULD NOT CARE LESS WHO BUYS THEIR PRODUCTS
JOURNALISTIC COVERAGE OF CHINESE FACTORIES ON THE OTHER HAND PLAYS UP THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND THE PRODUCTS THEY MAKE
MANY ARTICLES CALCULATE
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR THIS WORKER TO WORK IN ORDER TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT HE'S MAKING
FOR EXAMPLE AN ENTRY LEVEL LINE ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN CHINA IN AN IPHONE PLANT
WOULD HAVE TO SHELL OUT TWO AND A HALF MONTHS' WAGES FOR AN IPHONE
UP ALMOST NEVER INCLUDING LIVING CONDITIONS THAT TO ME LOOKED CLOSE TO PRISON LIFE 10 OR 15 WORKERS IN ONE ROOM 50 PEOPLE SHARING A SINGLE BATHROOM DAYS AND NIGHTS RULED
SHOULD HAVE SOME AMBITION WHILE SHE IS YOUNG SO THAT IN OLD AGE SHE CAN LOOK BACK ON HER LIFE AND FEEL THAT IT WAS NOT LIVED TO NO PURPOSE
HOW MUCH THEY'RE SELF MOTIVATED SELF DRIVEN RESOURCEFUL AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME WHAT THEY WANT MOST IS EDUCATION
TWO YEARS GETTING TO KNOW ASSEMBLY LINE WORKERS LIKE THESE IN THE SOUTH CHINA FACTORY CITY CALLED DONGGUAN CERTAIN SUBJECTS CAME UP OVER AND OVER HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MADE WHAT KIND OF HUSBAND THEY HOPED TO MARRY WHETHER THEY SHOULD JUMP TO ANOTHER
THEY'LL MOVE ON INTO HIGHER JOBS WITHIN APPLE AND YOU CAN HELP THEIR SOCIAL MOBILITY AND THEIR SELF
SIMPLE THINGS IN ENGLISH SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP THESE WORKERS START THESE SMALL VERY FOCUSED VERY PRAGMATIC CLASSES IN THESE SCHOOLS AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS ALL YOUR WORKERS ARE GOING TO MOVE ON
WHAT KARL MARX WOULD HAVE MADE OF MIN AND HER SISTERS THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRODUCT OF THEIR LABOR WAS MORE COMPLICATED SURPRISING AND FUNNY THAN HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED AND YET
PURSE IS ALSO REMINDER THAT THE THINGS THAT YOU IMAGINE SITTING IN YOUR OFFICE OR IN THE LIBRARY
I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE THINGS WE USE EVERY DAY
OUR SHOES OUR HANDBAGS OUR COMPUTERS AND CELL PHONES
NOW THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT OFTEN CALLS UP LOT
OF GUILT IMAGINE THE TEENAGE FARM GIRL WHO MAKES LESS THAN A DOLLAR AN HOUR STITCHING YOUR RUNNING SHOES
OR THE YOUNG CHINESE MAN WHO JUMPS OFF A ROOFTOP AFTER WORKING OVERTIME ASSEMBLING YOUR IPAD
WE THE BENEFICIARIES OF GLOBALIZATION
SEEM TO EXPLOIT THESE VICTIMS WITH EVERY PURCHASE WE MAKE
AND THE INJUSTICE FEELS EMBEDDED IN THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES
AFTER ALL WHAT'S WRONG WITH A WORLD IN WHICH A WORKER ON AN IPHONE ASSEMBLY LINE CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO BUY ONE
APARTMENT FOR HER PARENTS SHE RECENTLY RETURNED TO DONGGUAN ON HER OWN TO TAKE A JOB IN A FACTORY THAT MAKES CONSTRUCTION
ME TO THE YOUNG WOMEN I WROTE ABOUT TIES THAT ARE NOT ECONOMIC BUT PERSONAL IN NATURE MEASURED NOT IN MONEY BUT IN MEMORIES
MEANINGFUL IS THIS CALCULATION REALLY
FOR EXAMPLE I RECENTLY WROTE AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY AN AD IN IT
BUT WHO CARES I DON'T WANT AN AD IN THE NEW YORKER AND MOST OF THESE WORKERS DON'T REALLY WANT IPHONES
THEIR CALCULATIONS ARE DIFFERENT
HOW LONG SHOULD I STAY IN THIS FACTORY HOW MUCH MONEY CAN I SAVE
HOW MUCH WILL IT TAKE TO BUY AN APARTMENT OR A CAR TO GET MARRIED OR TO PUT MY CHILD THROUGH SCHOOL
THERE A NARRATIVE OF SOME KIND OF LEVEL OF GROWTH THAT THINGS OVER TIME WERE GETTING BETTER LC
DEFINITELY I MEAN YOU KNOW IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I SPENT BASICALLY TWO YEARS HANGING OUT IN THIS CITY DONGGUAN AND OVER THAT TIME YOU COULD SEE IMMENSE CHANGE IN EVERY PERSON'S LIFE
UPWARD DOWNWARD SIDEWAYS BUT GENERALLY UPWARD IF YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME IT'S UPWARD AND I MET PEOPLE WHO HAD MOVED TO THE CITY 10 YEARS AGO AND WHO ARE NOW BASICALLY URBAN MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE SO THE TRAJECTORY IS DEFINITELY UPWARD IT'S JUST HARD TO SEE WHEN YOU'RE SUDDENLY SUCKED INTO THE CITY IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S POOR AND DESPERATE BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY
FARMING VILLAGE AND ENDS WITH IPHONES IN OUR POCKETS AND NIKES ON OUR FEET AND COACH HANDBAGS ON OUR ARMS THAT HAS CHANGED THE WAY THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORK AND MARRY AND LIVE AND THINK
OF THEM WOULD WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS USED TO BE
SO MUCH ON OURSELVES AND OUR GADGETS WE HAVE RENDERED THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE OTHER END INTO INVISIBILITY AS TINY AND INTERCHANGEABLE AS THE PARTS OF A MOBILE PHONE
WORLD THE COACH BAGS HAD A CURIOUS CURRENCY THEY WEREN'T {NS} CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL VALUE BECAUSE ALMOST NO ONE THEY KNEW WANTED TO BUY ONE OR KNEW HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH
SAID TO HER PARENTS IN AMERICA THIS BAG SELLS FOR 320 DOLLARS HER PARENTS WHO ARE BOTH FARMERS LOOKED ON SPEECHLESS AND THAT'S NOT ALL COACH IS COMING OUT WITH A NEW LINE 2191 SHE SAID ONE BAG WILL SELL FOR 6000
HOW YOU FIND THEM WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO OUT INTO THE WORLD {NS}
CHINA THERE ARE 150 MILLION WORKERS LIKE HER ONE THIRD OF THEM WOMEN WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR VILLAGES TO WORK IN THE FACTORIES THE HOTELS THE RESTAURANTS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SITES OF THE BIG CITIES TOGETHER THEY MAKE UP THE LARGEST MIGRATION IN
THEIR PERSPECTIVE WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM IS MUCH WORSE AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING IS HOPEFULLY MUCH BETTER AND I JUST
TWO YEARS I WATCHED AS SHE SWITCHED JOBS FIVE TIMES
EVENTUALLY LANDING A LUCRATIVE POST IN THE PURCHASING DEPARTMENT OF A HARDWARE FACTORY
LATER SHE MARRIED A FELLOW MIGRANT WORKER
MOVED WITH HIM TO HIS VILLAGE
GAVE BIRTH TO TWO DAUGHTERS
AND SAVED ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A SECONDHAND BUICK FOR HERSELF
BOYFRIEND WHO HAD TRAVELED HOME WITH HER FOR THE NEW YEAR SAID IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S WORTH THAT MUCH MIN'S SISTER TURNED TO HIM AND SAID SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SHIT
EVERYONE THEY KNEW LIVED IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT WAS STILL BETTER THAN THE DORMITORIES AND HOMES OF RURAL CHINA
TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD
TO MIGRATE AND SUFFER IN SUCH TERRIBLE WAYS
IN FACT CHINA MAKES GOODS FOR MARKETS ALL OVER THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS OWN
THANKS TO A COMBINATION OF FACTORS
ITS LOW COSTS ITS LARGE AND EDUCATED WORKFORCE
AND A FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM THAT RESPONDS QUICKLY TO MARKET DEMANDS
I FOUND YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE SMART AND FUNNY AND BRAVE AND GENEROUS BY OPENING UP THEIR LIVES TO ME THEY TAUGHT ME SO MUCH ABOUT FACTORIES AND ABOUT CHINA AND ABOUT HOW TO LIVE IN THE WORLD
WHEN PEOPLE SEE MY IMAGES A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL SAY OH MY GOD HAVE
WORKING ON CALLED HAPPINESS REVEALED AND IT'LL GIVE US A GLIMPSE INTO THAT PERSPECTIVE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A CHILD AND AN ELDERLY MAN OF THAT WORLD
GRADUATED UCLA I MOVED TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I LIVED IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED ELK ON THE MENDOCINO COAST AND I DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE OR TV BUT I HAD U S MAIL
IT CONNECTS WITH SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE YOUR SOUL IT CREATES A GATEWAY FOR YOUR INNER VOICE TO RISE UP AND BE HEARD AND GOD GOD IS THAT PERSONAL JOURNEY WE ALL WANT TO BE ON TO BE INSPIRED
IT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION MAKES YOU PRESENT MAKES YOU MINDFUL THE
LIFE FLASH BEFORE YOUR EYES IN SEVEN MINUTES YOU SEE EVERY MOMENT THAT HAS
ABOUT A YEAR AGO I REALIZED THAT IF I WANTED TO COME OUT OF THIS I HAD TO START MAKING CHANGES I COULDN'T ALLOW MY PROBLEMS TO DEFINE ME IF
TO DISNEY WORLD WITH OUR CHAMBER SINGERS LEARNING A SECOND LANGUAGE
TRAVELING TO COSTA RICA TO EXPERIENCE MORE OF THE COSTA RICAN CULTURE AGAIN
AND GOING TO OUR SENIOR PROM
GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER
WE'VE TRAVELED TO AWESOME PLACES SUCH AS TORONTO BALTIMORE BOSTON AND MISSOURI
JUST TO NAME A FEW
WITHIN THESE POSITIVE TIMES I HAVE LEARNED TO TRULY LOVE CHERISH AND PROTECT MY FAMILY AND CLOSE FRIENDS
MANY OF THESE GOOD TIMES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN I ONCE MORE REFUSED TO ALLOW MY PROBLEMS TO DEFINE ME SO HERE COME THE GOOD TIMES WITHIN THESE GOOD
WITH MY LIFE REGRETFULLY THE POWER OF THESE MOMENTS WOULD BE LESS THAN THAT OF THE NEGATIVE ONES MOMENTS WHEN I FELL DOWN AND FELT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE TO HELP ME BACK UP
THAT IS ORGANIZING THE MISSION CURRENTLY I AM WORKING AS A FULL TIME PROGRAM ASSISTANT AT BLACK ROCK SUMMER CAMP AND LOVING EVERY SECOND THE FRIENDS THAT HAVE MADE
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE POSITIVE TIMES AND EXPERIENCE TRUE HAPPINESS
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND CAUSE THE AWESOME MOMENTS TO HAPPEN
YOU CAN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THEM TO COME AND RESCUE YOU FROM THE DARKNESS AS I HAD BEEN DOING FOR SO LONG
IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE TRUE POSITIVE MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE
AND BE SURE THAT IN YOUR SEVEN MINUTES YOU WILL HAVE MORE POSITIVE MOMENTS THAN NEGATIVE ONES
AND AS I WAS BEING PUSHED OUT OF THESE CIRCLES OF FRIENDS EVERY ONCE IN WHILE I WOULD FIND A GOOD FRIEND THAT I WOULD KEEP IN CONTACT WITH AND THESE FRIENDS UNBEKNOWNST TO
MYSELF SO AS I WAS GOING THROUGH ALL OF THESE BAD TIMES I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT
DOCTORS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO IN CANADA CONDUCTED A STUDY IN WHICH THEY FOUND THAT AFTER DEATH THE HUMAN BRAIN IS STILL ACTIVE FOR APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MINUTES
ME IF I WERE TO DIE TODAY I'D HAVE PLENTY OF POSITIVE MEMORIES TO LOOK BACK UPON MOMENTS TO LAUGH ABOUT AND TO MAKE ME FEEL
OF THE SEVEN MINUTE PRINCIPLE AS I SAID ABOUT YEAR AGO I STARTED REALIZING THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE A CHANGE SO I DID I WENT OUT AND I MADE A CHANGE
THIS MAKES ME HAPPY WHAT MOMENTS WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL LESS THAN PROUD OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD WANT TO RE EXPERIENCE MORE POSITIVE MOMENTS THAN NEGATIVE ONES WE'LL CALL THIS THE SEVEN MINUTE PRINCIPLE I'LL GIVE YOU AN
TO MAKE US EXTREMELY ILL IF YOU SPEND
I LEFT SCHOOL I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET A JOB AS AN APPRENTICE TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST
AND ACTIVITY EXERCISE IS A BIG PART OF MY LIFE IT IS ALSO A BIG PART OF WHAT I DO WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE
THAT WAS 25 YEARS AGO AND IN FACT IT SHAPED MY FUTURE SO MUCH
BECAUSE IT FORCES YOU TO MAKE SOME VERY BIG DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR LIFE LITTLE THAT I KNOW HOW MUCH THAT TIME WAS GOING TO CHANGE
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW EASY IT IS TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE STRATEGIES THE FIRST THING I
ACTUALLY BUT MANY OF THE COMPUTERS THAT WE HAVE NOWADAYS THEY ALSO HAVE DIMMERS ON THEM AS WELL AND THERE ARE APPS YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ONTO YOUR DEVICES THAT ACTUALLY ELIMINATE THE BLUE LIGHT WITHIN THE SCREEN WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST
EASY TO SEE HOW OUR CHOICES IN LIFE MATTER BUT QUITE OFTEN
THAT I NOW MADE IT MY PURPOSE IN LIFE TO EXPLORE AND RESEARCH HOW OUR
HISTORY TYPE 2 DIABETES OBESITY CANCER HEART
OR YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE VITAMIN RUNNING BUT WE ALSO THROUGHOUT THE DAY NEED TO BE DOING THINGS LIKE VITAMIN
BUT THAT ISN'T ALWAYS AS EASY AS IT SEEMS BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN WE ARE MORE INTENT IN TAKING MORE CARE OF THINGS LIKE OUR IPHONES AND OUR CARS THAN WE ARE IN OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL
OF WHAT I DO IS JUST SIMPLY ACT AS A GO BETWEEN BETWEEN ALL THE
BODY IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY HEALING AND REGENERATING SYSTEMS THAT NATURE HAS EVER PRODUCED
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CUT YOURSELF TO SEE HOW AMAZING IT IS
FIRST
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STEPS IN AND CLEANS AND
OPENED UP INTO A WORLD OF FASHION SHOWS
RATHER GET YOU TO THINK ABOUT FOOD AND JUST HOW MUCH IT'S CHANGED IN THE LAST 50 OR 60 YEARS MUCH OF THE FOOD WE ARE EATING AND DRINKING TODAY IS PROCESSED WHICH MEANS IT'S BEEN
TO AS MUCH NATURAL LIGHT AS YOU CAN THROUGHOUT THE DAY PARTICULARLY IN THE MORNING BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM OF THE
AND BEFORE LONG MY LIFE WAS LIKE LIVING A DREAM MY DAYS WERE AMAZING AND
NOT ONLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR QUALITY OF LIFE
OF LIFE WHETHER WE REALIZE IT OR NOT EVERYTHING WE DO IN
TO BE THAT INACTIVE AND SEDENTARY AND AS RESULT THERE ARE NOW OVER 24 CHRONIC DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH LONG TERM SITTING MOVEMENT IS A FORM OF NUTRITION AND LIKE MOST FORMS OF NUTRITION YOU
WHICH MEANS IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE MORE
OF MEDICATION OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR ACTIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO NOT
PILLAR NUMBER 2 WHICH IS DIET AND NUTRITION
ABOVE ALL AND IT'S ONE THAT'S BASICALLY BEEN TOTALLY FORGOTTEN AND THAT'S SLEEP SLEEP IS
THAT'S OUT THERE AND PEOPLE THAT SIMPLY WANT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIFE I'M NOT A DOCTOR AND I DON'T DIAGNOSE HOWEVER
OF THE FUTURE WILL PRESCRIBE NO MEDICATION INSTEAD HE SAID THEY WILL INTEREST THEIR PATIENTS IN
THAT EXIST IN THEIR ORIGINAL STATE AND THESE ARE ALSO FOODS THAT DON'T HAVE INGREDIENTS TEXT SLAPPED ON THE SIDE WITH INGREDIENTS YOU CAN HARDLY PRONOUNCE
BE EATING IT IT IS CLEAR THAT OUR HEALTH IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD THAT WE EAT EATING REAL FOOD ISN'T THAT HARD BUT IT JUST MIGHT TAKE SOME PLANNING
LIVES THE WORD HORMONE LITERALLY MEANS TO SET INTO MOTION THAT'S
SIMPLE AND CHEAP LIFESTYLE STRATEGIES AND THESE STRATEGIES REALLY AREN'T COMPLICATED IN FACT IT'S THE SMALL ACTIONABLE STEPS THAT OFTEN PRODUCE THE BEST RESULTS
TIME THAT WE ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON HEALTHCARE THAN EVER BEFORE
BECOME THE MORE WE NEGLECTED THE NATURAL HEALING POWERS OF
SUGAR AND FAT BUT THERE IS A REAL MOVEMENT
YOU ARE DOING VITAMIN SITTING WHICH IN ITSELF ACTUALLY ISN'T THAT BAD BUT
THE WOUND THEN MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF NEW CELLS ARE FORMED IN ORDER TO CREATE NEW SKIN BUT PERHAPS THE MOST
MY NOW VERY GLAMOROUS LIFE I FOUND MYSELF LIVING ON A CONSTANT DIET OF COFFEE ALCOHOL AND WHATEVER
A GROWING CHILD YOU'LL SEE HOW POWERFUL THESE CHEMICALS WE CALL HORMONES ACTUALLY ARE
AS I SAID BEFORE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A LOT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO
BEFORE THE WAY IT LOOKED THE WAY IT FELT THE WAY IT SOUNDED IT JUST BEGAN TO SORT OF POPULATE THROUGHOUT ALL OF CULTURE BOTH GAMING AND NON GAMING IT JUST IT WAS EVERYWHERE FOR A LONG TIME AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT'VE REMEMBERED THE LATE 70S EARLY 80S THIS IS COMING OFF OF THE CRASH OF THE VIDEO GAMES INDUSTRY IN 83 84 THE INDUSTRY WAS ALMOST NON EXISTED IT GONE FROM WAY UP HERE WITH ARCADES BEING THE THING
TO ALMOST A COMPLETELY DEAD INDUSTRY AND NINTENDO HAD BROUGHT IT BACK
AND WHAT THEY ALLOWED US TO DO AND ALLOWED PEOPLE LIKE ME TO CONNECT OVER SOMETHING THAT WE WERE SUPER INTERESTED IN I WAS NEVER REALLY BIG IN THIS SPORT
BUT PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO SORT OF SEE THIS AS A THING AND SO BY THE 90S 30 OF HOMES HAD A NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IN IT
COMPARE THAT TO
SO SOMEBODY STUDENT MEMBER OF OUR AUDIENCE MUST'VE KNOWN I'M THROWING AROUND THE NUMBER A LOT THE NUMBER 35 THE REASON I'M DOING THAT IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE AVERAGE
OUT THE FRONT DOOR A COUPLE TIMES TO JUST GET AWAY AND I HATED READING SO I STARTED JUST FOR FUN I PULLED OUT 3 OF MY FAVORITE GAMES THIS IS FINAL FANTASY
PERSON TO START CONVERSATION I HATE TALKING ABOUT MYSELF TEDX TALK IS CERTAINLY LIKE
OUT THERE
BUT VIDEO GAMES I WAS INSTANTLY CAPTIVATED BY AND SO BEING IN THIS NEW WORLD WHERE I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY FRIENDS THIS GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DIG DEEP INTO AND IT GAVE SOMETHING FOR MY SISTER AND I TO PLAY IT TOGETHER
BUT COMING
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR THE IPHONE 7 IN SEPTEMBER THE POKEMON GO CREATORS CAME OUT AND THEY
REALLY ALLOWED ME TO SORT OF HAVE THE SENSE OF SHARED CONNECTION
CREATED FOR HUMANITY TO REALLY SEE WHERE WE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE
OF GOOD ISAAC ASIMOV POPULARIZED THIS PERSONA WITH HIS THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS
BLOWN AWAY
BY THIS POWER TO CREATE THINGS
AND I WONDERED
WHAT IF WE COULD CREATE A THINKING MACHINE
HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE THE WORLD
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY THESE PAST THREE DECADES
WHILE WE DON'T YET HAVE THIS UNIVERSAL NOTION OF AN AI WE
DO HAVE A NEW GENERATION OF SMART MACHINES
THAT THINK LIKE WE DO
AND HAVE BECOME INTEGRAL IN OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES EVEN WHEN WE DON'T REALIZE IT
THEY POWER THE VIRTUAL ASSISTANCE ON OUR SMART PHONES
WATSON HIT THE BOOKS
AND
HE REVIEWED CLINICAL CASES MEDICAL RECORDS EVEN CONVERSED WITH
COLLEAGUES
BUT UNLIKE
A MEDICAL STUDENT WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO REVIEW A FEW THOUSAND CASES
WATSON REVIEWED
BATTLE IBM RECENTLY PAIRED UP WITH NEW YORK MEMORIAL HOSPITAL TO PUT THEIR SUPER COMPUTER THEIR JEOPARDY WINNING WATSON THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL NOW LIKE MOST
I WAS SO EXCITED I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING EARLY BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE
IT'S 4 IN THIS AUDIENCE
THOSE NUMBERS ARE DOWN FROM HISTORIC HIGHS
BUT THEY ARE STILL 4 TIMES THE RATE FROM JUST 50 YEARS AGO AND IT COMES AT A TIME WHEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE STRETCHED DANGEROUSLY THIN
THERE'S A NEW SYSTEM CALLED PREDPOL
AND GIVING THEM A LEG UP IN THIS INCREASINGLY CONNECTED ECONOMY
OR IMAGINE
AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS AND DRONES ENTERING WAR ZONES
NOT TO FIGHT
BUT TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN AID
THIS ALL MAY SOUND LIKE SCIENCE FICTION BUT COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON THESE VERY TECHNOLOGIES TODAY
YOU'RE HERE AT TEDX OR YOU'RE WATCHING ONLINE THAT MEANS YOU WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
AI CAN BE LIKE A MEGAPHONE FOR YOUR INNER VOICE
IT CAN INCREASE YOUR REACH YOUR IMPACT YOUR
TAKE AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE JORDAN
JORDAN IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAS SEEN
A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION
DESPITE SOME OF ITS NEIGHBORS NOW WHAT WORKED THERE
AND CAN WE APPLY THAT
TO GUATEMALA
HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD IN CENTRAL AMERICA
THAT IS STRUGGLING WITH ITS OWN HUNGER PROBLEM BUT OTHERWISE LOOKS A LOT LIKE JORDAN
THIS IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER THE BLANKET GLOBAL STRATEGIES FOR COMBATING HUNGER OF THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES
THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES
THINK OF WHAT ELSE IS POSSIBLE
IMAGINE A ROBOTIC NURSE PROVIDING HOME HEALTH CARE AND COMPANIONSHIP
FOR THE WORLD'S AGING POPULATION
WITH THIS SYSTEM CITIES LIKE LA AND ATLANTA HAVE SEEN CRIME REDUCED 10 40 AS A RESULT OF THIS AI IS
COMPUTERS HAVE NOW BESTED US AT QUINTESSENTIAL HUMAN MENTAL ACTIVITIES THINGS LIKE CHESS AND JEOPARDY
EVERYTHING FROM THE MARS ROVER TO OUR SELF PARKING CARS THEY
WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE WORDS WHAT'S THE FIRST IMAGE THAT COMES TO MIND NOW IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE YOU TEND TO THINK OF ONE OF THREE PERSONAS
A FULL 1 IN 9 THAT'S 800 MILLION PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD TO LEAD A HEALTHY ACTIVE LIFESTYLE
AND IT'S NOT JUST A FOREIGN PROBLEM HERE IN THE US
HERE IN OHIO HERE IN DAYTON
THAT NUMBER'S 1 IN 6
BUT THERE BRIGHT SPOTS
IT IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
PRETTY MUCH MY WHOLE LIFE
30 YEARS EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID
I STILL REMEMBER CHRISTMAS MORNING IN FIRST GRADE OUR PARENTS GOT US AN IBM PC JUNIOR
A PROFOUND POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THIS WORLD I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE WHAT WE CREATE TOGETHER IN THE NEXT 30 YEARS I HOPE YOU'RE EXCITED TOO THANK YOU VERY
RESTAURANT SUGGESTION APP
OR CAN WE DO BETTER
CAN WE USE THESE SMART MACHINES TO DO GOOD IN THE WORLD
I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT ORGANIZATIONS TODAY ARE ALREADY DOING JUST THAT
LET'S LOOK AT COUPLE OF EXAMPLES
IN THIS THIRD CAMP OF AI AS A HERO AND THIS QUESTION AND
I WASN'T VERY BOOK SMART IN FACT I WAS FULL ON BOOK DUMB
MY LIFE SHE STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION WITH ME TO
WE CURRENTLY USE IS ONE IN WHICH THE MENTEE IS PORTRAYED MERELY AS A VESSEL THAT KNOWLEDGE IS
AND AT THAT MOMENT I WAS ABOUT TO POTENTIALLY BECOME THE FAILED FIRST
AND HIDING STUPID MY WHOLE LIFE
GOOD QUALITY MENTORING ARE LARGELY UNPREPARED TO MENTOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE POPULATION WHO
THE LIVES THAT YOU CAN CHANGE AND BE SURE TO DIVERSIFY VISIBLE MINORITIES WOMEN
WAY TO DROP OUT I MET LEE ELLEN
I DIDN'T WITHDRAW THAT DAY INSTEAD I WAS SOON
BUT BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE UNLIMITED POWER OF MENTORSHIP
INDIVIDUALS AND I DON'T MEAN MONETARILY I MEAN INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE ACHIEVED WHAT THEY'VE SET OUT TO DO
AND GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE INTERNATIONAL MENTORING ASSOCIATION
SHE IS A GREAT MENTOR I
ABOUT CHANCES ARE YOU'RE A BOOMER OR TRADITIONALIST SO SOMEWHERE NORTH OF 50 AND CHANCES ARE REALLY GOOD YOU'RE WHITE MALE AND CHANCES ARE REALLY REALLY GOOD YOU WERE MENTORED BY ANOTHER WHITE MALE
ONLY STUDYING ENGLISH LITERATURE PERUSING A PHD BUT SHE
AGE ALL OF MY SUCCESSES WORTH CELEBRATING WERE HARD EARNED AND DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE MAGIC THE MAGIC OF MENTORING
ALL BECAUSE SUCCESSFUL MENTEES GO ON TO BECOME GOOD MENTORS
LOOK I HAD THE GRADES TO PROVE IT I BELIEVED IT WITH ALL OF MY
HELP LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU NEED IF THESE PEOPLE STEPPED INTO A PHONE BOOTH AND RIPPED OFF THEIR SHIRT THE ONE UNDERNEATH WOULD HAVE A GREAT BIG M ON IT
AND DOES EVERYONE HERE KNOW HOW TO SPOT A MENTOR
EQUATION IT'S NO LONGER THE MENTOR IT'S NOT THE MENTOR AT ALL IT'S THE MENTEE WE CAN HACK MENTORING
KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT DON'T EXPECT YOUR MENTOR TO KNOW HOW TO MENTOR YOU SHOW UP PREPARED
I FAILED GRADE 9 AND FOR EXAMPLE MY HIGH SCHOOL PROVINCIAL
AND BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS HAS BEEN MORE VALUABLE TO ME THAN CLASSROOM LEARNING
WANT A MIRROR IMAGE OF YOURSELF AND REMEMBER A MENTOR'S QUALITIES AND
PHD AND I'M HUMBLED THAT
CULTIVATING YOUR MENTOR NETWORK REMEMBER TO TEND YOUR MENTORS MUCH LIKE YOU MIGHT A FLOWER GARDEN AND KNOW THAT MENTORS RARELY LOOK
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN ONE MIGHT CROSS YOUR PATH
YOU HAVE TO BE THE DRIVER LOOK YOU'RE THE DRIVER OF YOUR OWN LIFE WHY NOT THIS TOO AND
BECAUSE THE FORMULA IS BROKEN IF YOU DON'T SAY IT
ABOUT THREE DECADES READING AND ESPECIALLY WRITING WERE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF REACH FOR ME
THESE GUYS THESE EXECUTIVES THESE ROLE
YET MORE THAN 40 PERCENT 40 PERCENT OF MILLENNIALS ARE WITHOUT A MENTOR
LEAD EXPECTING MORE OF YOURSELF AS A MENTEE WELL IT
WORK
PLUS SOME LUCKY BREAKS PLUS
GOOD MENTORS WITH A LITTLE OF PIXIE
DUST BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE
CULTIVATING GOOD MENTOR RELATIONSHIPS
IS COMPLEX AS A MENTEE YOU HAVE TO WANT IT
AS A RESEARCHER I BEGAN TO ASK MYSELF HOW HAS MENTORING AFFECTED
MENTORING OTHER WHITE GUYS THIS FORMULA IS PASS SINCE THEN THE WORKFORCE HAS
I HAD ALWAYS FELT AS THOUGH I WAS PART OF AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS BUILT ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT EVERYONE OF VALUE WAS IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER
ANSWERS BECAME MY ANSWERS {LG} YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S CODE FOR
NOT ALL GOOD MENTORS ARE IN THE SAME FIELD AS YOU OR
COMPASSION
IT DESERVES NO TREATMENT
AS MINORITY MARTYRDOM
AND IT DESERVES NOT TO BE DEEMED ANYTHING
BUT A PERNICIOUS
SICKNESS
THAT'S FROM TIME MAGAZINE IN 1966 WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD
AND LAST YEAR
YOU HAVE FOR YOUR CHILDREN IS LIKE NO OTHER FEELING IN THE WORLD
AND UNTIL YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
AND WHEN I WAS LITTLE I TOOK IT AS THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT IN THE WORLD THAT SHE WOULD SAY THAT ABOUT PARENTING MY BROTHER AND ME
AND WHEN I WAS AN ADOLESCENT
THINK IF WE LOST EVERYONE WITH DOWN SYNDROME IT WOULD BE A CATASTROPHIC LOSS
AND KAREN ROBARDS SAID TO ME I'M WITH TOM FOR DAVID I WOULD CURE IT IN AN INSTANT TO GIVE HIM AN EASIER LIFE
BUT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF WELL I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED 23 YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS BORN THAT I COULD COME TO SUCH A POINT
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF IT'S MADE ME SO MUCH BETTER AND SO MUCH KINDER AND SO MUCH MORE PURPOSEFUL IN MY WHOLE LIFE THAT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF
I WOULDN'T GIVE IT UP FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
WE LIVE AT POINT WHEN SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE FOR THESE AND MANY OTHER CONDITIONS IS ON THE UP AND
FAMILY THAT PERCEIVES ITSELF TO BE NORMAL WITH A CHILD WHO SEEMS TO BE EXTRAORDINARY
AND I HATCHED THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE REALLY TWO KINDS OF IDENTITY
THERE ARE VERTICAL IDENTITIES WHICH ARE PASSED DOWN GENERATIONALLY FROM PARENT TO CHILD
THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE ETHNICITY FREQUENTLY NATIONALITY LANGUAGE OFTEN RELIGION THOSE ARE THINGS YOU HAVE IN COMMON WITH YOUR PARENTS AND WITH YOUR CHILDREN AND WHILE SOME OF THEM CAN BE DIFFICULT THERE'S NO ATTEMPT TO CURE THEM
HAD COME TO SEE HOW IT CONQUERS EVERYTHING ELSE
AND WHILE I HAD SOMETIMES THOUGHT THE PARENTS I WAS INTERVIEWING WERE FOOLS ENSLAVING THEMSELVES TO A LIFETIME'S JOURNEY
WITH THEIR THANKLESS CHILDREN
AND TRYING TO BREED IDENTITY OUT OF MISERY
I REALIZED THAT DAY
THAT MY RESEARCH HAD BUILT ME A PLANK
AND THAT I WAS READY TO JOIN THEM ON THEIR SHIP
THANK YOU
FACING THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO DO WITH THIS CHILD SHOULD SHE SAY YOU'RE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT A LITTLE BIT SHORTER
OR SHOULD SHE TRY TO CONSTRUCT SOME KIND OF DWARF IDENTITY GET INVOLVED IN THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF AMERICA BECOME AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING FOR DWARFS AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT MOST DEAF CHILDREN ARE BORN TO HEARING PARENTS THOSE HEARING PARENTS TEND TO TRY TO CURE THEM THOSE DEAF PEOPLE DISCOVER COMMUNITY SOMEHOW IN
UPON THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES WHO ARE BEING TAUGHT
IN THE TIME SINCE THAT ATLANTIC MONTHLY STORY RAN THE LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME HAS TRIPLED THE EXPERIENCE OF DOWN SYNDROME PEOPLE INCLUDES THOSE WHO ARE ACTORS THOSE WHO ARE WRITERS SOME WHO ARE ABLE TO LIVE FULLY INDEPENDENTLY IN ADULTHOOD
THE ROBARDS HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THAT AND I SAID DO YOU REGRET IT
DO YOU WISH YOUR CHILD DIDN'T HAVE DOWN SYNDROME DO YOU WISH YOU'D NEVER HEARD OF IT
AND INTERESTINGLY HIS FATHER SAID WELL FOR DAVID OUR SON I REGRET IT BECAUSE FOR DAVID IT'S DIFFICULT WAY TO BE IN THE WORLD AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE DAVID AN EASIER LIFE
I HAD A CLOSE FRIEND FROM COLLEGE WHO'D GONE THROUGH A DIVORCE AND WANTED TO HAVE CHILDREN AND SO SHE AND I HAVE DAUGHTER AND MOTHER AND DAUGHTER LIVE IN
ENCOUNTERED SO MUCH STRANGE LOVE AND I FELL VERY NATURALLY INTO ITS BEWITCHING PATTERNS AND I SAW
THE FACT THAT MY FAVORITE COLOR NOW IS BLUE BUT I'M STILL GAY {LG} IS EVIDENCE OF BOTH MY MOTHER'S INFLUENCE AND ITS LIMITS {LG}
NOBODY WHO IS TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF CHILDREN BORN TO AFRICAN AMERICANS AND ASIANS COME OUT WITH CREAMY SKIN AND YELLOW HAIR
THERE ARE THESE OTHER IDENTITIES WHICH YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM A PEER GROUP AND I CALL THEM HORIZONTAL IDENTITIES BECAUSE THE PEER GROUP IS THE HORIZONTAL
SCHOOL WORK AND HE WORKED VERY HARD BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND HE ENDED UP ACHIEVING AT A LEVEL THAT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN CONTEMPLATED BY ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY HE WAS THE FIRST ONE IN HIS FAMILY IN FACT TO GO TO
TO FULL SIZE TESTING IN HUMANS IS AROUND THE CORNER
THERE ARE BLOOD TESTS WHICH ARE MAKING PROGRESS THAT WOULD PICK UP DOWN SYNDROME MORE CLEARLY AND EARLIER IN PREGNANCIES THAN EVER BEFORE MAKING IT EASIER AND EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO ELIMINATE THOSE PREGNANCIES OR TO TERMINATE THEM AND SO WE HAVE BOTH SOCIAL PROGRESS AND MEDICAL PROGRESS
AND I BELIEVE IN BOTH OF THEM I BELIEVE THE SOCIAL PROGRESS IS FANTASTIC AND MEANINGFUL AND WONDERFUL AND I THINK THE SAME THING ABOUT THE MEDICAL PROGRESS BUT I THINK IT'S A TRAGEDY WHEN ONE OF THEM DOESN'T SEE THE OTHER
AND WHEN I SEE THE WAY THEY'RE INTERSECTING IN CONDITIONS LIKE THE THREE I'VE JUST DESCRIBED I SOMETIMES THINK IT'S LIKE THOSE MOMENTS IN GRAND OPERA WHEN THE HERO REALIZES HE LOVES THE HEROINE AT THE EXACT MOMENT THAT SHE LIES EXPIRING ON A
LEAVE HIM AT THE HOSPITAL SO THAT HE COULD DIE THERE QUIETLY
AND HIS MOTHER SAID SHE WASN'T GOING TO DO IT AND SHE TOOK HER SON HOME AND EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL OR FINANCIAL ADVANTAGES SHE FOUND THE BEST DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY FOR DEALING WITH DIASTROPHIC DWARFISM AND SHE GOT CLINTON ENROLLED WITH HIM AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS CHILDHOOD HE HAD 30 MAJOR SURGICAL
ARE IDENTITIES THAT ARE ALIEN TO YOUR PARENTS AND THAT YOU HAVE TO DISCOVER WHEN YOU GET TO SEE THEM IN PEERS AND THOSE IDENTITIES THOSE HORIZONTAL IDENTITIES PEOPLE HAVE ALMOST ALWAYS TRIED TO CURE
AND I WANTED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE PROCESS IS THROUGH WHICH PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOSE IDENTITIES COME TO A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE WERE THREE LEVELS OF ACCEPTANCE THAT NEEDED TO TAKE
LOVED HIM THAT'S ALL
CLINTON JUST ALWAYS HAD THAT LIGHT IN HIM
AND HIS FATHER AND I WERE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO BE THE FIRST TO SEE IT THERE
I'M GOING TO QUOTE FROM ANOTHER MAGAZINE OF THE 60S THIS ONE IS FROM 1968 THE
ATLANTIC MONTHLY VOICE OF LIBERAL AMERICA
WRITTEN BY AN IMPORTANT BIOETHICIST HE SAID
THERE IS NO REASON TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT PUTTING A DOWN
MISS DEAF AMERICA CONTEST IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE WHERE PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT THAT SLURRY SOUTHERN SIGNING
TO BE WHOEVER IT IS THAT THEY'VE COME TO BE
ONE OF THE FAMILIES I INTERVIEWED FOR THIS PROJECT WAS THE FAMILY OF DYLAN KLEBOLD WHO WAS ONE OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE
IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO PERSUADE THEM TO TALK TO ME AND ONCE THEY AGREED THEY WERE SO FULL OF THEIR STORY THAT THEY COULDN'T STOP TELLING IT AND THE FIRST WEEKEND I SPENT WITH THEM THE FIRST OF MANY
I RECORDED MORE THAN 20 HOURS OF CONVERSATION AND ON SUNDAY NIGHT WE WERE ALL EXHAUSTED WE WERE SITTING IN THE KITCHEN SUE KLEBOLD WAS FIXING DINNER AND I SAID IF DYLAN WERE HERE NOW DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'D WANT TO ASK HIM
STUDYING IS HOW MUCH LOVE THERE CAN BE EVEN WHEN EVERYTHING APPEARS TO BE GOING
WRONG
I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THE MOTHER OF ONE DISABLED CHILD I HAD SEEN A
SEVERELY DISABLED CHILD WHO DIED THROUGH CAREGIVER NEGLECT
AND WHEN HIS ASHES WERE INTERRED HIS MOTHER SAID
I
PRAY HERE
FOR FORGIVENESS FOR HAVING BEEN TWICE ROBBED
ONCE OF THE CHILD I WANTED
AND ONCE OF THE SON I LOVED
AND I FIGURED IT WAS POSSIBLE THEN FOR ANYONE TO LOVE ANY CHILD IF THEY HAD THE EFFECTIVE WILL TO DO
TO SAY IT IT MADE ME FURIOUS I SAID
I'M GAY THAT'S NOT THE DIRECTION THAT I'M HEADED IN AND I WANT YOU TO STOP SAYING THAT
ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO I WAS ASKED BY MY EDITORS AT THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE TO WRITE PIECE ABOUT DEAF CULTURE
AND I WAS RATHER TAKEN ABACK I HAD THOUGHT OF DEAFNESS ENTIRELY AS AN ILLNESS THOSE POOR PEOPLE THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEY LACKED HEARING AND WHAT COULD WE DO FOR
PARENTS OF FOUR CHILDREN IN THREE STATES
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE EXISTENCE OF MY FAMILY SOMEHOW UNDERMINES OR WEAKENS OR DAMAGES THEIR FAMILY AND
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT FAMILIES LIKE MINE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO EXIST AND I DON'T ACCEPT SUBTRACTIVE MODELS OF LOVE
ONLY ADDITIVE ONES AND I BELIEVE THAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE
LAURA THE LESBIAN MOTHER OF OLIVER AND LUCY IN MINNEAPOLIS
AND YET WE ALSO LIVE AT THE MOMENT WHEN OUR ABILITY TO ELIMINATE THOSE CONDITIONS HAS REACHED A HEIGHT WE NEVER IMAGINED BEFORE
MOST DEAF INFANTS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES NOW WILL RECEIVE COCHLEAR IMPLANTS WHICH ARE PUT INTO THE
BRAIN AND CONNECTED TO A RECEIVER AND WHICH ALLOW THEM TO ACQUIRE A FACSIMILE OF HEARING AND TO USE ORAL
DID YOU COME FROM
IT TURNS OUT THAT WHILE EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IS SILOED THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY FAMILIES DEALING WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WHO ARE TRANSGENDER THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY FAMILIES OF PRODIGIES WHO ALSO FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN MANY WAYS THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY FAMILIES IN EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES BUT IF YOU START TO
IN PURELY NON RELIGIOUS TERMS HOMOSEXUALITY REPRESENTS A MISUSE OF THE SEXUAL FACULTY
I THOUGHT HOW MY MOTHER
WAS RIGHT I THOUGHT
THE LOVE YOU HAVE FOR YOUR CHILDREN
IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER FEELING IN THE WORLD
AND UNTIL YOU HAVE CHILDREN
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
I THINK CHILDREN HAD ENSNARED ME THE MOMENT I CONNECTED FATHERHOOD WITH LOSS
THAT AGAIN
THIS IS WHAT WE HEAR WHEN YOU MOURN OVER OUR EXISTENCE
THIS IS WHAT WE HEAR WHEN YOU PRAY FOR A CURE
THAT YOUR FONDEST WISH FOR US IS THAT SOMEDAY WE WILL CEASE TO BE
AND STRANGERS YOU CAN LOVE
WILL MOVE IN BEHIND OUR FACES
BETTER CHILDREN MORE POLITE FUNNIER NICER SMARTER
I WOULD CLING TO THE CHILDREN I HAVE AND PRAY AWAY THAT ATROCIOUS SPECTACLE
AND ULTIMATELY I FEEL THAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE TEST FLAME RETARDANT PAJAMAS IN AN INFERNO TO ENSURE THEY WON'T CATCH FIRE WHEN OUR CHILD REACHES ACROSS THE
ANGRY BECAUSE THEY FEEL AS THOUGH THEIR PARENTS DON'T LOVE THEM WHEN WHAT ACTUALLY HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THEIR PARENTS DON'T ACCEPT THEM
LOVE IS SOMETHING THAT IDEALLY IS THERE UNCONDITIONALLY THROUGHOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PARENT AND A CHILD
BUT ACCEPTANCE IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES TIME IT ALWAYS TAKES TIME
ONE OF THE DWARFS I GOT TO KNOW WAS A GUY NAMED CLINTON BROWN
PEDIATRICIAN CAME INTO THE HOSPITAL ROOM AND SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED
HE WASN'T EXTENDING HIS LEGS APPROPRIATELY SHE SAID THAT MIGHT MEAN THAT HE HAD BRAIN DAMAGE
IN SO FAR AS HE WAS EXTENDING THEM HE WAS DOING SO ASYMMETRICALLY WHICH SHE THOUGHT COULD MEAN THAT THERE WAS A TUMOR OF SOME KIND IN ACTION AND HE HAD VERY LARGE HEAD WHICH SHE THOUGHT MIGHT INDICATE HYDROCEPHALUS AND AS SHE TOLD ME ALL OF THESE THINGS I FELT THE VERY CENTER OF MY BEING POURING OUT ONTO THE
WANT TO JOIN THEIR NUMBER BECAUSE WHAT I WAS ENCOUNTERING WAS AN IDEA OF ILLNESS AND LIKE ALL PARENTS SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME I WANTED TO PROTECT MY CHILD FROM ILLNESS AND I WANTED ALSO TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM ILLNESS AND YET I KNEW FROM THE WORK I HAD DONE THAT IF HE HAD ANY OF THE THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO START TESTING FOR THAT THOSE WOULD ULTIMATELY BE HIS IDENTITY AND IF THEY WERE HIS IDENTITY THEY WOULD BECOME MY IDENTITY THAT THAT ILLNESS WAS GOING TO TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT SHAPE AS IT UNFOLDED
YOU KNOW WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED I USED TO WISH THAT I HAD NEVER MARRIED THAT I HAD NEVER HAD CHILDREN IF I HADN'T GONE TO OHIO STATE AND CROSSED PATHS WITH TOM THIS CHILD WOULDN'T HAVE EXISTED AND THIS TERRIBLE THING WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
THE PAIN THEY CAUSED TO ME
THERE IS SHE SAID
SO WHILE I RECOGNIZE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THE WORLD IF DYLAN HAD NEVER BEEN BORN
I'VE DECIDED
THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR ME
I THOUGHT IT WAS SURPRISING HOW ALL OF THESE FAMILIES HAD ALL OF THESE CHILDREN WITH ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS PROBLEMS THAT THEY MOSTLY WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO AVOID AND THAT THEY HAD ALL FOUND SO MUCH MEANING IN THAT EXPERIENCE OF PARENTING
AND THEN I
SAID TO US THAT WE COULD EACH HAVE A BALLOON TO TAKE HOME MY BROTHER WANTED A RED BALLOON AND I WANTED A PINK BALLOON
WE HELD PEOPLE TO BE AND THE CHANGE THAT'S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THERE WHICH IS ALMOST EQUALLY RADICAL IS ONE THAT WE PAY NOT VERY MUCH ATTENTION TO
ONE OF THE FAMILIES I INTERVIEWED TOM AND KAREN ROBARDS WERE TAKEN ABACK WHEN AS YOUNG AND SUCCESSFUL NEW YORKERS THEIR FIRST CHILD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DOWN
SAID I SAW THAT CAR WHICH YOU CAN ALWAYS RECOGNIZE AND I THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF
THEY'RE SIX FEET TALL HE'S THREE FEET TALL TWO BEERS FOR THEM IS FOUR BEERS FOR HIM
SHE SAID I KNEW I COULDN'T GO IN THERE AND INTERRUPT HIM BUT I WENT HOME AND I LEFT HIM EIGHT MESSAGES ON HIS CELL PHONE
SHE SAID AND THEN I THOUGHT IF SOMEONE HAD SAID TO ME WHEN HE WAS BORN
I DECIDED
TO HAVE CHILDREN WHILE I WAS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT
AND
MANY PEOPLE WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID BUT HOW CAN YOU DECIDE TO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE MIDST OF STUDYING EVERYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG
AND I SAID I'M NOT STUDYING EVERYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG
THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE AND THEN SHE LOOKED BACK UP AND SAID I WOULD ASK HIM TO FORGIVE ME FOR BEING HIS MOTHER AND NEVER KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE HIS HEAD
WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT IN THE MORNING HE HAD PROBABLY HAD A CRAMP {LG} BUT
WE VALIDATE IN OUR CHILDREN AND WHAT DO WE CURE IN THEM
JIM SINCLAIR A PROMINENT AUTISM ACTIVIST SAID
WHEN PARENTS SAY
I WISH MY CHILD DID NOT HAVE AUTISM'
WHAT THEY'RE REALLY SAYING IS I WISH THE CHILD I HAVE DID NOT EXIST AND I HAD A DIFFERENT NON AUTISTIC CHILD INSTEAD
CARRIES NO GUILT
TRUE GUILT ARISES ONLY FROM AN OFFENSE AGAINST PERSON
AND A DOWN'S IS NOT
A PERSON
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INK GIVEN TO THE ENORMOUS PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE TREATMENT OF GAY PEOPLE THE FACT THAT OUR ATTITUDE HAS CHANGED IS IN THE HEADLINES EVERY DAY
BUT WE FORGET HOW WE USED TO SEE PEOPLE WHO HAD OTHER DIFFERENCES HOW WE USED TO SEE PEOPLE WHO WERE DISABLED
MEMBERSHIP IN A CULTURE WERE SAYING SOMETHING THAT WAS VIABLE IT WASN'T MY CULTURE AND I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO RUSH OFF AND JOIN IT
BUT I APPRECIATED THAT IT WAS A CULTURE AND THAT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MEMBERS OF IT IT FELT AS VALUABLE AS LATINO CULTURE OR GAY CULTURE OR JEWISH CULTURE IT FELT AS VALID PERHAPS EVEN AS AMERICAN CULTURE
AND MY QUESTION IS HOW DID WE GET FROM THERE TO HERE HOW DID AN ILLNESS BECOME AN
OF US WHO HAVE CHILDREN LOVE THE CHILDREN WE HAVE WITH THEIR FLAWS IF SOME GLORIOUS ANGEL SUDDENLY DESCENDED THROUGH MY LIVING ROOM CEILING AND OFFERED TO TAKE AWAY THE CHILDREN I HAVE AND GIVE ME
MAMA THAT'S WHAT I CALL MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME MANY STORIES ABOUT YORUBA MYTHOLOGY
YOU SEE AS A YOUNG CHILD I SAW ART EVERYWHERE I REMEMBER THE HOUSE WE LIVED IN IN ILORIN IN STADIUM
TONIGHT THEY REPRESENT MY HOPES AND MY FEARS
I WAS SO FRUSTRATED SEEING ALL THE INJUSTICE AROUND ME AND MY ONLY OUTLET WAS ART SO I STARTED PAINTING
WAS ELSEWHERE I SAW A VERY TOUGH REALITY I WORKED WITH CHILDREN WHO HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING AN EDUCATION AND ACTUALLY BEING FORCED INTO MARRIAGE
HOWEVER THE ATTORNEY IN ME IS STILL THERE SO I USE MY ART TO FIGHT FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IN
I NEVER KNEW HOW THIS WAS GOING TO INFLUENCE THE ARTIST THAT I AM TODAY
SAME SEX RELATIONSHIP IS CRIMINALIZED YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET 14 YEARS FOR THAT
ANYTHING I COULD FIND MY HAND ON I PAINTED AND EVERYTHING BECAME MY CANVAS SO ONE
I WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AFRICAN ART ON THE CONTINENT AND HERE AND
I REALIZED THE POWER BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE SO PROUD TO WEAR THEIR
YOU SEE WITH MY ART THE WAY I WEAVE MY ART AROUND THE PATTERNS THE MASKS THE
WHEN YOU TAP INTO YOUR ORI THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY MOVE MOUNTAINS SO
WHEN I GREW UP I KNEW BEING AN ARTIST WAS NOT AN OPTION SO I WANTED TO BE THE PERSON MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO BE SO I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL
I REMEMBER MY MOM SAID LAOLU WE ARE CHRISTIANS WHY DON'T YOU DRAW LIKE OTHER PEOPLE WHY DON'T YOU DRAW LANDSCAPES OR MAYBE YOU DRAW CHAIRS OR FURNITURE OR MAYBE EVEN DRAW
BROKE NO MONEY NO GALLERY AGENTS NO REPRESENTATION SO NO GALLERY WOULD SHOW MY WORK SO
SEE MAMA HAD TATTOOS ON HER ARMS AND HER LEGS AS A CHILD I THOUGHT SHE WAS BORN WITH THEM WITH BEAUTIFUL BLACK LINES AND DETAILED SYMBOLS AND THEN SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY SYMBOLS FROM THE YORUBA MYTHOLOGY
LEMONADE DROPPED OF COURSE BOOM EVERYTHING JUST WENT FROM ZERO TO 100 REAL FAST PEOPLE FEATURED ME IN MAGAZINES INTERVIEWS PEOPLE STOPPED ME IN THE STREET PEOPLE KNEW MY NAME LIKE
I REMEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER AND I REALIZED THAT MOST OF MY CREATIVE INSTINCTS WERE ACTUALLY BASED ON MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
A STORY AND EVERY ARTIST HAS A NAME THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND I GOT AN EMAIL THAT SAID HI I'M A BIG FAN OF YOUR WORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAINT FOR MY MUSIC VIDEO SIGNED BEYONC LIKE BEYONC EMAILED
CLASSES AND I WOULD MAKE UP EXCUSES WHY I WASN'T GOING TO
YOU SEE THE YORUBAS ARE AN ETHNIC GROUP FROM THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF NIGERIA AND I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED BY THESE STORIES I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED AND YORUBA CULTURE HAS INSPIRED MY ART SINCE I WAS A CHILD
BLACKING OUT {LG} AND COLLAPSING ONTO THE TILE JORDAN BLOOD SCHOLAR IN A TURQUOISE BIKINI SAYING NOW YOU ARE READY TO
IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE A MAGICIAN CASTING A SPELL OF KNOWLEDGE OVER THE AUDIENCE I OFTEN WONDERED WHAT MY TRUTH WOULD BE AS A POET WHAT STORY WOULD PEOPLE LOOK TO ME TO TELL WELL
WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING IS FOR EVERYONE TO LEAVE HERE LOOKING AT
FORM IF SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM STOOD UP AND TOLD THEIR MOST EMBARRASSING STORY
CONDITIONED TO DO THIS TO TAKE UP LESS SPACE WITH OUR NARRATIVES AND INSTEAD MAKE ROOM FOR THE STORIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DEEMED MOST IMPORTANT SO FIRST WE MUST RESIST THE URGE TO BRUSH OFF OUR OWN LIVES ONCE WE HAVE
BUT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS STORY I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU TO WRITE THE POEM THOUGH I HOPE YOU LEAVE HERE WITH THE TOOLS TO
THROUGH MY OWN WRITING AND THROUGH THE WRITING OF OTHERS THAT IT IS NOT THE BIG STORIES THAT REACH MILLIONS IT'S THE TINY ONES
LIKELY NOT BE THE SAME AS ANYONE ELSE'S IN THIS ROOM AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR IDENTICAL WE'RE LOOKING FOR CONNECTION CONNECTION HAPPENS THROUGH KNOWING WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE
A STORY BECOMES BUT LET ME EXPLAIN I TELL MY STUDENTS TO CHOOSE
BEFORE TELLING IT PRACTICED IT DURING
NEXT THE PROCESS BECOMES KNITTING IT OUT IT SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE THE IDEA THAT THE MORE SPECIFIC YOU GET THE MORE
AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN KNOW THAT FEELING IS THROUGH VISCERAL DESCRIPTION AND
BELLY SO YOU KEPT YOUR HANDS AT YOUR LOWER STOMACH ALL DAY MAYBE
SOME OF THEM EXPERIENCED NEITHER BUT HAD A BEST FRIEND LIKE JORDAN A LOUD VIVACIOUS GIRL WHO CONTROLS EVERYTHING AROUND HER
SOME OF THEM WERE JORDAN
SOME OF THEM STILL ARE
THIS IS WHERE WE FIND CONNECTION
THROUGH THE SPECIFIC
IF WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO LOOK AT OUR MEMORIES AND INSTEAD OF
{LG} SOME OF THEM ALSO BLACKED OUT AFTER THE FIRST TIME A REACTION I DID NOT KNOW WAS AS COMMON UNTIL
WORTH TELLING ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES COMES FROM THE POET GUANTE WHO SAYS
OR RATHER TERRIFIED OF THE UNDISCOVERED CRATER
THE MUSCLE THAT HOLDS AND PULLS AND KEEPS AND SHEDS SHE SAID
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU
AND YES WE HAD SEEN EACH OTHER NAKED MANY TIMES
WE HAD SHOWERED TOGETHER AND COMPARED NIPPLES WISHED TO TRADE THE SMALLS AND BIGS
I LIKED THIS SMALL PILL OF STORY
HOW IT MADE MY LIFE BITE SIZED AND INTERESTING
BUT STILL
THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN MARGO
HOW HER SPIT WAS TACKY AND HARSH FROM GUMMY NEW GROWTH
HOW I WAS THE BOY BECAUSE
WHEN WE'RE HONEST WITH OUR MEMORIES WHEN WE NOTICE WHAT STICKS WITH US REGARDLESS OF IF WE UNDERSTAND WHY WE MUST HONOR AND TRUST
I ADMIRE THIS DESIRE I TOO HAVE STRIVEN TOWARDS IT
AND STORYTELLING MATTER I KNOW NOT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM
NOW IF I TOLD YOU TO ZOOM IN EVEN MORE AND TELL THE STORY WITH THE TWO PIECE SWIMSUIT AS THE FOCAL POINT YOU MIGHT WRITE ABOUT HOW IT WAS YOUR FIRST TIME
IN A SHOWER IT WAS 2004 AND HIS NAME WAS NOAH MY BEST FRIEND SINCE GRADE SCHOOL WE WANTED THE FIRST KISS TO BE A SAFE BET THE KIND
THE REST OF THE DAY CURLED UP IN A TOWEL WHILE EVERYONE ELSE PLAYED
THIS IS WHERE WE FIND THE POEM IT BEGINS WITH
LEGS
KISSING MY BEST FRIEND IN HER BEDROOM
MASTERING THE ART OF CONCEALING THE BLOOD STAIN ON THE BACK OF MY JEANS
WHICH IS TO SAY I WRITE POEMS ABOUT GIRLHOOD
QUEERNESS
SHAME
TODAY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW OUR SMALLEST MEMORIES CAN
I WANT TO FIRST SAY THAT I WANT TO DEDICATE THIS TALK TO ALL THE FOLKS WHO LEAN INTO THE UNKNOWN AND SHARE THEIR STORIES ANYWAY I WANT
STAYS IN CHINA DOESN'T STAY THERE NASA HAS BEEN TRACKING A PHENOMENA CALLED THE BROWN CLOUD THOSE POLLUTANTS GET UP IN THE JET STREAM AND WITHIN SEVEN DAYS
YOUR CELLS
BIND TO A SUBSTANCE IN YOUR CELLS THAT RELEASES A MAGICAL DNA READING COMPOUND CALLED NRF2
THIS WHISPERS TO YOUR DNA AND IT SAYS HEY
YOU CAN DO MORE
YOU CAN BE MORE
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW
YOU START PRODUCING ANTIOXIDANT PROTEINS THAT COMBAT ALL THESE BIOHAZARDS
AT THE SAME TIME
THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS
THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES
SO I WANT YOU TO LEAVE TODAY
REMEMBERING A FEW THINGS ONE OF WHICH IS
BE KIND TO YOUR BROCCOLI
AND YOUR BROCCOLI WILL BE KIND TO YOU
THE OTHER THING IS
IF BROCCOLI CAN DO ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS
AND THIS CHEMICAL
WILL GET INTO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOUR CELLS
AND WHISPER TO YOUR DNA
YOU SEE THE BIOHAZARDS THAT COME IN THROUGH POLLUTION WILL GET INTO YOUR CELLS AND IRRITATE THEM
AND
BUT WAIT A SECOND
THEY FOUND A USE FOR THE ADDITIONAL OIL FROM THE EXTRACTIVE PROCESS THEY'RE TURNING THOSE INTO BIO FUELS
THEY'RE WORKING ON SOME OF THE CLEANEST JET FUEL ON THE PLANET NOW BEING DERIVED FROM CANOLA OIL THAT'S FROM THE MUSTARD FAMILY
SO THIS FAMILY OF VEGETABLES CAN DO WHAT
IT CAN RAMP UP OUR DNA AND PROTECT OUR CELLS
YEAH THOSE JOHNS HOPKINS RESEARCHERS THEY WENT OVER TO CHINA
AND THEY GAVE SULPHORAPHANE RICH BEVERAGES TO PEOPLE WHO WERE EXPOSED TO AIR POLLUTION
AND THEY FOUND THAT THOSE TOXINS THAT THEY WERE BREATHING IN
WERE FOUND MORE IN THE URINE AFTER THEY CONSUMED MORE SULFORAPHANE
THEY FOUND RATS EXPOSED TO PESTICIDES IF YOU GIVE THEM SULFORAPHANE IT PROTECTS THEM FROM DAMAGE
SO WAIT SECOND WE CAN PROTECT OURSELVES FROM DAMAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN LOWER OUR CHEMICAL EXPOSURE ALL FROM A SINGLE FAMILY
OF VEGETABLES
NOW IF THAT'S NOT
THE DEFINITION OF A SUPERHERO
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME TO BRING THESE TO THE LIMELIGHT FOLKS
STOP PUTTING
WHO KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOU
YOU'RE IN SOMEBODY'S PRESENCE WHO'S A WHISPERER YOU LOOK INTO THEIR EYES AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN YOU FEEL TALLER
YOU FEEL STRONGER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN DO MORE YOU CAN BE MORE
SO THAT'S WHY WE CALL BROCCOLI
A SUPERHERO
THE
OF FIVE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN
AND EVERY NIGHT
THAT I AM TELLING THEM STORIES AND THEY'RE TELLING ME STORIES I HAVE TO SAY
MY HEART SWELLS
AND I GET THIS PAPA BEAR' INSTINCT WHERE I WANT TO WRAP MY ARMS
AND PESTICIDES
BUT THANKFULLY WHEN I RUN BACK TO MY OFFICE AND I GET ON THE PHONE WITH WORLD RENOWNED RESEARCHERS AND I READ THOUSANDS OF PAPERS
I SEE HOPE IN DESPERATION I SEE WE HAVE SUPERHEROES RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW
AND SOME OF THEM ARE IN YOUR FRIDGE YOU MIGHT HAVE EVEN HAD THEM LAST NIGHT FOR DINNER
IT TURNS OUT
CAME FROM
BECAUSE I'VE TALKED TO WORLD RENOWNED AUTHORS AND RESEARCHERS AND THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT MULTIPLE POUNDS OF RAW CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES A DAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE AN IODINE INSUFFICIENCY AND THYROID PROBLEMS TO BEGIN WITH BEFORE THIS IS EVEN A CONCERN
SO EAT IT UP
AND WHEN YOU
ON THE WESTERN SEABOARD OF THE UNITED STATES ON MY CHILDREN'S HOME IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH LOOK AT SOME OF THE DATA ON PESTICIDES THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
WILL THERE BE MORE PEACE IN THE 21ST CENTURY BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY THE CENTURY WHERE WE LIVE WHERE OUR KIDS LIVE AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE INTERESTED IN THIS
ADVISE YOU NOT TO BELIEVE THAT THIS TRANSITION FROM OIL COAL GAS AND NUCLEAR ENERGY TO THE RENEWABLE ENERGIES WILL BE FAST AND EASY I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE
THE TOWERS COLLAPSED THAT'S BASICALLY 9 11 FOR MOST OF US PLANE PLANE TOWER TOWER
TO GO TOWARDS 100 RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT IS CHALLENGING I KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER
WE THINK ABOUT WAR AND WE THINK ABOUT PEACE IN THE 21ST CENTURY WE MUST
KIDS YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER AND THAT'S VERY VERY RARE OK
WHAT WE RESEARCH RIGHT NOW
IS WE TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THE PICTURE IN OUR MIND
THAT THE MEDIA
CONSTRUCTED
WITH THIS EVENT
WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR HEAD BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR HEAD IS OUR THOUGHTS OUR THOUGHTS SHAPE OUR ACTIONS THEY INFLUENCE OUR FEELINGS
CELLS I PUT THEM ON MY HOUSE AND THEY CREATE ELECTRICITY IT WORKS TRUST ME I EVEN BOUGHT THE CAR
COUNTRY WE HAVE 200 COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY THE MILITARY IS CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE A FORCE FOR
A KEY ISSUE A KEY ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO WAR AND PEACE IN THE 21ST CENTURY
UNIVERSITY IN SWITZERLAND AND MY STUDENTS HAD TO READ THE 9 11 COMMISSION
I ASSURE YOU IT'S NOT OFFENSIVE
2000 YEARS AGO WE HAD THE ROMAN EMPIRE
100 YEARS AGO WE HAD THE BRITISH EMPIRE
NOW WE HAVE THE AMERICAN EMPIRE
UNITED STATES IS THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHY
OF THE LAST 100 YEARS PROVE THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE
I THINK THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE MEDIA HAS MISLED US IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT WE LEARN TO DEAL WITH MEDIA IN THE 21ST
OF THESE SHIPS EVERY DAY IS WHAT WE NEED OTHERWISE THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
AND ENGINEERS FOR 9 11 TRUTH WHO SAYS THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT ASK YOURSELF I THINK WITHIN WAR AND PEACE WE ALWAYS
THAT THE COAL INDUSTRY IN GERMANY IS EVIL OR THAT COAL INDUSTRY IN CHINA IS EVIL IT'S NOT ABOUT NATIONS OK BUT THESE ARE BUSINESS MODELS
URGE YOU TO IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEN THIS MEANS THAT WE ARE NOT VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT TERRORISM AT
I URGE YOU TO DO IS TO GO BEYOND THIS WORD CONSPIRACY THEORIES
I KNOW THAT'S A LITTLE BIT STRANGE BECAUSE HISTORIANS
IT MATTERS ALL I LEARNT ABOUT 9 11 I LEARNT FROM MY AMERICAN
AFTER THE ATTACKS AND THIS WORD CONSPIRACY THEORIES HAS BLOCKED THE ENTIRE 9 11 DEBATE NOW FOR 15
GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REDUCE MILITARY SPENDING
FIRES AND THAT LED TO THE FREE FALL OF THE BUILDING
THE BUILDING HAS 81 COLUMNS AND THE ARCHITECTS SAY IN ORDER FOR THE BUILDING TO FALL SYMMETRICALLY ALL 81 COLUMNS HAVE TO VANISH AT THE SAME SECOND FOR THAT YOU NEED CONTROLLED DEMOLITION
YOU KNOW I HAVE THIS HOPE I REALLY HOPE THAT 100 RENEWABLE IS SOMETHING THAT WE TOGETHER CAN DO IN THE 21ST CENTURY
AND I CAN TELL YOU AS HISTORIAN THERE WAS NO ROLE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN IN 9 11 NOTHING OK THESE SOLDIERS ARE TERRIBLY MISTAKEN
THE TED BUDGET OK 2
NOW WE HAVE PUTIN AND HIS WAR IN SYRIA ASK YOURSELF WHETHER THE STORY THAT PUTIN PRESENTS IS TRUE OR
THE US GOVERNMENT PUBLISHED A NEW REPORT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY
YOU KNOW NO MENTIONING THAT THREE TOWERS COLLAPSED THAT'S QUITE BIG MISTAKE
INTERVIEWS BEING DONE WITH THOSE SOLDIERS AND TRUST ME THEY DON'T SAY WE ARE HERE IN IRAQ TO GRAB THE OIL THIS IS A RESOURCE WAR A WAR OF CONQUEST THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAY
IN 1945 AT THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR WE ONLY USED SIX MILLION BARRELS NOW IT'S 90 MILLION BARRELS EVERY BARREL HAS 159 LITERS SO TRUST ME IT'S A LOT OF OIL
SYRIA RIGHT NOW GOING ON ABOUT 400000 PEOPLE KILLED
YOU IT'S EITHER FIRE OR CONTROLLED DEMOLITION
AND YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR YOURSELF
AS HISTORIANS WE OBSERVE THAT POLITICIANS VERY POWERFUL POLITICIANS TELL US NOT TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS
PRESIDENT BUSH SAID OSAMA BIN LADEN DID IT
OSAMA BIN LADEN
IS FROM SAUDI ARABIA
WE LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUSH AND THE SAUDI ROYAL
HAD TO REMOVE MY GARDEN WHICH THIS CITATION WAS TURNING INTO A WARRANT AND I'M LIKE COME ON
THING IS THE DRIVE THRUS ARE KILLING MORE PEOPLE THAN THE DRIVE BYS
UTTER ABSENCE IN ANY SERIOUS REPORT PROSE IS OVERRATED OVERSERIOUS AND
BUT MY POINT IT IS NOT HIM BUT THIS PROSE
TO FIND WORDS THAT
TICKLE
AND STICK
STOP STUFFING DEAD LETTERS AND ALL THAT NOT MATTERS
IN JUSTIFIED PARAGRAPHS PILLED UP IN PAPER PACKAGES
TO ADVISE
IS TO CONVEY TO LET YOUR READERS SEE WHAT IS TO SAY
AND THAT IS AN ART
SO WRITE YOURSELF
A WINDOW IN YOUR HEART
COUNTLESS CONSULTANTS LET YOUR RATTLING FINGERS ON
15 MINUTES TO COME UP WITH 160
CHARACTERS IN PLAIN BUT SWINGING LANGUAGE PITCHING THE SAME REPORT BUT THEN TO THE POINT POWERFUL AND HEART FELT
AND MY STUDENTS WERE NO POET LAUREATES
YET NO ONE ACCEPTED IT WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE GOOD ENOUGH POETRY
IN WHICH FORM ADDS MEANING TO CONTENT
RHYTHM GUIDES READER'S INTERPRETATION
ESSENTIALY SOMETHING THAT WORRIES THE IPCC HEAVILY THEN WHY DOES
AFFECTING THE OCEAN'S ECOSYSTEMS THIS MATTER OF FACT
I AM A CONSULTANT MYSELF BUT THAT COMES LATER STACKS OF GREAT ADVICE END UP DEAD BECAUSE WRITTEN IN PROSE AS IF NOT MEANT TO BE READ NOW MY ADVICE
WAS TO UNLOCK CREATIVITY IN WRITTING SO I DISTRIBUTED SOME SUMMARIES OF REPORTS AND SAID MAKE A 160 CHARACTER POEM AN SMS OUT OF IT
WITHOUT THE BLOODSPILLS AND THE TORN FLESH COMPARE
A LITERAL OVERDOSE
IF MEMOS AND REPORTS SHOULD BE CONCISE
RESONATE
ACTIVATE
STEAL HEARTS AND RENEW OUR EYES
ONE WONDERS WHY INSTEAD THERE ARE OFTEN BIG FAT FILES THAT FAIL TO IMPRESS
FOR CONSERVATIVE REASONS
POEMS ARE LABELLED CRYPTIC
UNSERIOUS AND UNSUITED FOR THE ADULTS ONLY INDUSTRY OF CONSULTING
BUT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE
POETS DECRYPT THE MOST COMPLEX AND DISCLOSE MEANING NOT JUST FOR THE ADEPTS BUT FOR
A GLOBAL AUDIENCE
RUDE STUFF ABOUT THEM
JUDGING CAN MAKE PEOPLE SICK AND DEPRESSED JUST BY SAYING SOMETHING LIKE YOU'RE FAT' OR NOBODY LIKES YOU' CAN CAUSE PEOPLE TO THINKING DOWN ON THEMSELVES AND IT WILL MAKE THEM
LIKE GO INTO A DEPRESSION AND NOT WANNA BE IN BY ANYONE IN THIRD GRADE THERE WAS THIS GIRL AND SHE'D ALWAYS COME UP TO ME AND
THEY ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH YOU
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WAS MEANT TO BE DIFFERENT AND IF EVERYONE WAS THE SAME THEN IT WOULDN'T
BE LIKE NOT A GOOD MIXED UP PLACE AND EVERYONE WOULD BE THE SAME AND HAVE THE SAME HOBBIES AND INTERESTS
SO THAT'S
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT EVERYONE AIN'T THE SAME
THEY'RE NOT COOL ENOUGH TO HANG OUT WITH OR NO I DON'T LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY LOOK FUNNY YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE SAYING DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER WELL THAT'S ALWAYS TRUE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE LOOKS DIFFERENT DOESN'T
BECAUSE WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE OUR BRAIN AUTOMATICALLY TAKES A PICTURE OF THEM AND DECIDES WHETHER THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT JUST AND WE JUDGE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF JEALOUSY WHEN WE SE SOMEONE WE AUTOMATICALLY JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THEM
YOU OR YOU'RE FAT AND YOU
LIKE AREN'T COOL ENOUGH
THEN THE WHOLE THIRD GRADE FOUND OUT AND IT MADE ME FEEL DOWN ON MYSELF AND NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING
SCIENTISTS ARE DOING RESEARCH AND THEY'RE PUTTING
PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD TODAY FOR PEOPLE IS INADEQUATE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING
INDUSTRY THAT IS IN HARMONY WITH NATURE THANK YOU
WITH BACTERIA AND I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU SOME STOP MOTION FOOTAGE THAT I MADE
TECHNIQUE FOR COUNTRIES WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AROUND THE
PLASTICS PACKAGES AND PAPER
OF THE IDEA AND IT WAS TRANSCENDED INTO A WHOLE GLOBAL AUDIENCE SIR YOU MIGHT ASK ME
OF LIFE THEN NO MESSING IN BONTEHEUWEL' WAS BORN
WITH ONE MESS OF CLEANUP CAMPAIGN BUT THEY ALSO NEEDED TO BE A MINDSET CHANGE
ONTO THE 80S
MOVED ONTO THE 90S MOVED ONTO THE 2000S
AND THEN NOTABLY IN 2008
WAS THE GREAT AMERICAN CLEANUP
AND THEN
THE QUEEN OF TALK
OPRAH WINFREY
SURE THE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND INTO THE MINDSET OF THE PEOPLE BUT IN THE
NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FOR MY LEFT HANDSIDE THAT DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO PICK UP A PAPER
YOUNG OLD FEMALE
AND BLUE GUM BONTEHEUWEL TRANSLATED FROM AFRIKAANS INTO ENGLISH MEANS COLORFUL HILL
IF YOU SIR GO TO YOUR HOLIDAY TAKING THE N2 TO CAPE TOWN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT BONTEHEUWEL WILL BE ON YOUR LEFT
BUT THE SUCCESS WAS MAJOR FAR BEYOND DEBT EVEN
IF ONE PERSON PICKS UP ONE PAPER PER DAY WE CAN MAKE A CHANGE THAT IDEA IS NOT ALL TOO NEW IT STARTED ALREADY IN THE 1970S
I SALUTE YOU ONE PAPER ONE PERSON ONE PLANET I THANK YOU
BUT BONTEHEUWEL LET ONE ONE ONE BIG PROBLEM
THIS PIECE OF PAPER MAY LAND UP IN YOUR BACKYARD AND THIS PAPER WILL DEFINITELY LAND UP IN YOUR OLYMPIC
THIS OF COURSE WAS A SITUATION THAT PROVOKED TWO THINGS EITHER TO TURN AWAY AND
THE CAPITAL CITY OF SOMALILAND WHERE NO HOSPITAL HAD EVER BEEN BUILT BEFORE THAT TIME
DEDICATED
AND THEY DO NOT GET STOLEN
TO WORK IN OTHER HEALTH FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAINED AS MIDWIVES THEY REMAIN IN MIDWIFERY
AND UNLESS AFRICA
AND COUNTRIES LIKE MINE
MULTIPLY
THE
ARE TREATED WOMEN ARE TREATED CHILDREN WHATEVER WE ALSO
POSSIBLE FOR US TO SAY WE ARE A MATERNITY HOSPITAL GO AND GET YOUR HEART ATTACK TREATED SOMEWHERE ELSE GO AND GET YOUR DIABETIC COMA SEEN TO SOMEWHERE ELSE
WHAT WE DO IS THAT WE RELY ON THE TWO YEAR TRAINED MIDWIVES
THE SITE UPON WHICH THE HOSPITAL WAS BUILT WAS ONE THAT WAS ONCE A GRAVEYARD A MILITARY PARADE GROUND AN EXECUTION GROUND
ONLY 185 OF THEM WERE CESARIAN SECTIONS
THE OTHERS
CONTRACTURES CLEFT LIPS
OBSTETRICAL FISTULA
THYROIDS
AND
ON THAT SITE
THAT WAS ONCE A GARBAGE DUMP
WE CAN ALSO OPERATE ON CHILDREN WHO HAVE HYDROCEPHALUS SO WE CAN EVEN DO
NOT BRAIN SURGERY BUT WE TEMPER WE
ARE TRAINED FOR JUST TWO YEARS WHO GO BACK TO THE DISTRICTS AND THE REGIONS WE RECRUITED THEM FROM WHO
OR THAT THERE IS A DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THE SIZE OF THE BABY AND THE SIZE OF HER PELVIS NO WOMAN WOULD DIE IN YOUR COUNTRY
OF THE HUMAN BEINGS YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING WE HAVE TRAINED OVER
THANK GOD ALL BUT ONE HAVE SUCCEEDED AND THE ONE WHO DIED DIED OF DIARRHEA AND VOMITING TWO WEEKS AFTER THE OPERATION
WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WE CAN DEAL WITH HEMORRHAGE AS SOON AS A WOMAN COMES IN WE HAVE AN OPERATING THEATER THAT WORKS 24 HOURS A DAY IT IS
CHILDREN THAT WE DELIVERED IN THE HOSPITAL WERE MAINLY DELIVERED BECAUSE THEY WERE SENT TO US BECAUSE OF A COMPLICATION EITHER WITH THE PREGNANCY OR WITH THE MOTHER
TO HELP THEM TO SCREEN THEM TO IDENTIFY THE ONES WHO ARE HAVING A NORMAL PREGNANCY AND ARE POSSIBLY EXPECTED TO HAVE A NORMAL OUTCOME
MY LAST
PARTING
SUGGESTION
IS
DON'T
EVER
UNDERESTIMATE
THE CAPACITY
OF
A HUMAN BEING
WHO IS DETERMINED TO DO SOMETHING
IF I AT 60
14 YEARS AGO COULD BUILD A HOSPITAL
ANYBODY
ANY OF YOU CAN DO IT
OR WOMEN WHO HAD FOUND SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEIR PREGNANCY
NO WOMAN DIES IN YOUR COUNTRIES OF UTERINE RUPTURE SHE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO GO INTO LABOR BECAUSE
HAS THE CONFIDENCE
TO UTILIZE WHATEVER HEALTH FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE
WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE THE BATTLE
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT HAS REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE
IN MY APPRECIATION
OF HUMAN TENACITY
AND THE STRENGTH OF WOMEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
IS WHEN I SEE WOMEN
WHO COME IN TO
{NS} THANK YOU MY NAME IS EDNA ADAN AND I'M MIDWIFE AND BECAUSE I'M A MIDWIFE I'VE COME TO TALK TO YOU
IN YOUR COUNTRIES
IT'S ONE IN 4000
YOUR WOMEN ARE TREATED BY DOCTORS AND MIDWIVES
THROUGHOUT THEIR PREGNANCY
ONLY
10
OF OUR WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO A HEALTH FACILITY
AND THAT IS WHY
THAT HAS HELPED ME TO HELP OTHERS AND OF COURSE
WORK IN THESE FACILITIES AND UNLESS YOU HAVE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND MIDWIVES
MORTALITY RATE TO A QUARTER
OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BECAUSE OF THE TRAINING OF MIDWIVES
WHY NOT IN OTHER COUNTRIES
WHY NOT IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA WHY NOT IN ETHIOPIA
WHY NOT IN ERYTREA WHY NOT IN NEIGHBOURING SOMALIA
WHY NOT IN LESOTHO AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A VERY HIGH MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IF IT CAN BE DONE IN SOMALILAND IT CAN BE DONE ANYWHERE
MY MESSAGE
MY MESSAGE
IS TO GOVERNMENTS
INSTEAD OF SPENDING MONEY ON TANKS AND GUNS AND BAZOOKAS AND I DON'T KNOW MILITARY HARDWARE
WHAT THE WORLD HAD GIVEN TO ME THIS
YES WE NEED GRADUATE NURSES AND MIDWIVES BUT WE DON'T HAVE THEM AND WE DON'T HAVE THE FOUR YEARS AND THE FIVE YEARS IT TAKES
WE HAVE DELIVERED WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE TO A QUARTER OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE
GO THROUGH A TRANSFORMATION THAT GIVES THEM THE CONFIDENCE TO THINK TO ANSWER TO ADVISE TO GUIDE AND TO HELP OTHER WOMEN
MY HOPE
MY AMBITION
IS THAT ONE DAY WE WILL HAVE A THOUSAND OF THESE MIDWIVES
AND WHY NOT IN OTHER COUNTRIES
IF SOMALILAND CAN DO IT ANYBODY CAN DO IT
IF SOMALILAND
WITH ITS LIMITED RESOURCES
EQUIPMENT THAT IS STERILE AND THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED TO BE USED SAFELY
BUT OUR WOMEN DIE OF THESE CAUSES OUR WOMEN DIE OF CAUSES THAT NO WOMAN IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHERE MAN HAS REACHED THE MOON NO WOMAN SHOULD DIE OF
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS WE DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES
IN OUR COUNTRIES
YES WE NEED DOCTORS BUT THEY TAKE 8 OR 9 YEARS TO TRAIN AND FOR GOODNESS SAKES WHERE AM I GOING TO GET DOCTORS FROM TO WORK IN SOMALILAND
YOUR EYE YOU GO TO THE OPHTALMOLOGIST YOU BREAK AN ARM YOU GO TO THE ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON BUT IN AFRICA IN MY COUNTRY IF YOU'RE SICK
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SEDENTARY BUT WHEN THEY'RE NOMADS IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE
ONE EDUCATION THE SECOND IS
AND I KEPT ASKING WHY WHY WAS I MAKING THIS SO MUCH HARDER FOR MYSELF WHY WAS I
FULL OF SO MUCH PASSION AND I KNOW THAT IF YOU PUT YOUR HEART TO IT YOU CAN LOVE YOURSELF AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE THANK YOU SO
BEGGED THAT I WOULD NEVER LOSE THAT BECAUSE WITH EVERY STRAND OF HAIR I LOST STRAND OF
THAT'S HOLDING THEM BACK THAT MAY BE SOMETHING PHYSICAL LIKE HAIR OR MAKEUP OR YOUR SKIN YOUR ACNE YOUR
THOSE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF SELF BULLYING THAT WE DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT WE'RE DOING HOW MANY
STRAIGHT AUDIENCES CAN'T EMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE WHO AREN'T THE SAME AS THEM YET LGBT PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY EMPATHIZING AND UNDERSTANDING AND
FEMALE LOVE INTEREST
AND YOU ARE A MAN
YOU ARE ASSUMED TO BE STRAIGHT
IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY A LOT
OF PEOPLE
HAVE THE
PHRASE STRAIGHT UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE
AND THEN IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE SAME SEX YOU ARE LABELED AS HOMOSEXUAL
THERE'S NO GROUND FOR MIDDLE OF THE SPECTRUM PEOPLE SUCH AS MYSELF
WITH SUCH AND SUCH CHARACTER FOR SUCH AND SUCH A REASON
REPRESENTATION IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE
AND WE'RE IN A BETTER SOCIETY TODAY
THAT CAN DEAL WITH THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND HELP PEOPLE REALIZE WHO THEY ARE
PLUS
AND THE ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY TO ALL DIRECTORS OUT THERE
IS IT'S 2016 A
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BECOMING LESS AND LESS SCARED OF THE
SCARY LGBT COMMUNITY
BEING REPRESENTED MORE AND MORE AND IT'S RIDICULOUS TO THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE'S GAY NO ONE'S GOING TO GO AND SEE THAT MOVIE
I FEEL THAT DIRECTORS SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN THEIR AUDIENCES BECAUSE
IT'S RIDICULOUS TO THINK THAT NO ONE'S GOING TO BE ABLE
I THANK YOU TODAY FOR LETTING ME COME UP HERE AND TALK TO YOU ALL AND I HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO SPREAD MORE LIGHT AND SHINE MORE LIGHT ONTO THE SCARY
INSTEAD SHE SAYS BREAKTHROUGHS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH VERY VERY SMALL ACTS AND SOMETIMES IT CAN MEAN JUST HAVING THE COURAGE TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF SPEAK OUT TO DEMAND TO BE TREATED WITH NOBILITY AND TO DEMAND TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY SO TODAY I WANT TO WELCOME TO THE STAGE EKATERINA WALTER PRESENTING PERCEPTIONS ARE REALITY OR ARE THEY AN IMMIGRANT'S JOURNEY
EKATERINA
THAT IS WHY IT'S ALSO
STRANGE TO ME
THAT SOMETIMES
PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN HERE
LAUGH
WHEN I USE THE EXPRESSION AMERICAN DREAM
I THINK
TO SOME SOMEHOW IT LOST ITS MEANING
NOT FULLY
TO SOME IT MEANS STRIKING IT RICH
TO SOME BECOMING A PRESIDENT
AN AMAZING AMBITION TO HAVE
TO SOME IT'S JUST A
IT IS EASY TO SETTLE INTO THE MENTALITY OF ENTITLEMENT
IT IS EASY TO GET DISCOURAGED WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH
GETTING HERE WAS A TOUGH JOURNEY
FULL OF UNBELIEVABLE SACRIFICES FOR MY FAMILY
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF DESPERATION
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF DOUBT AND I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE OF THOSE
BUT NO MATTER WHAT LIFE THROWS AT ME I HAVE MY GRANDMOTHER'S RESOLVE
MY MOTHER'S CONSTANT NUDGE TO TRY AGAIN
MY FATHER'S UNWAVERING BELIEF IN
ME MY LITTLE SISTER'S HUMOR
MY HUSBAND'S STRONG SHOULDER AND THEIR INFINITE LOVE
AND IF YOU HAVE THAT
AND LIVE IN THE LAND OF THE FREE
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
SO TODAY
I URGE ALL OF US
TO BREAKTHROUGH
THE BARRIERS WE SET FOR OURSELVES OR OTHERS SET FOR US AND DARE TO DREAM
TO REACH FOR THE STARS
TO GO GET YOUR AMERICAN DREAM WHATEVER IT MAY BE
AFTER ALL
THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE IN THE WORLD TO MAKE IT A REALITY
I HOPE
ONE
THEIR TRIUMPHS AS WELL
IT GAVE ENDLESS OPPORTUNITIES TO CULTIVATE INNOVATION AND URGE AMAZING PEOPLE
ALBERT EINSTEIN
JOSEPH PULITZER
ESTEE LAUDER
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT
ALL IMMIGRANTS BY THE WAY
AMERICA IS SUCH A HOPEFUL CHANCE FOR MANY LIVING ALL OVER THE WORLD
WHY I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE UNITED STATES IS THE TOP MIGRANT DESTINATION IN THE WORLD
IT IS NO MISTAKE 13 OF THE POPULATION IN THE US WAS BORN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY
THAT MORE THAN ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IN THE US ARE FIRST
THAT HALF OF SILICON VALLEY START UPS HAD ONE OR MORE IMMIGRANTS AS A KEY FOUNDER
THE CHANCE TO GROWN THE DREAM AND GROW IT WITH DIGNITY
MAKES THIS COUNTRY IRREPLACEABLE
IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT IT STANDS FOR
IT IS A BEACON OF NEW HOME
A NEW LIFE
OF EDUCATION
FREEDOM
OF LIMITLESS IMAGINATION
OF IMPOSSIBLE BECOMING POSSIBLE
OF REMARKABLE INNOVATION
AS AN IMMIGRANT THE CHANCE TO BUILD MY DIGNIFIED LEGACY MEANS THE WORLD
CAN YOU BLAME ME THEN THAT WHEN
I LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER
AND I THINK ABOUT HER FUTURE
AM FILL WITH PRIDE
I MAY NOT BECOME RICH AND I MAY NOT BECOME THE PRESIDENT
BUT
MY DAUGHTER WILL GROW UP KNOWING WHAT DIGNITY IS
SHE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HER OWN CHOICES
SHE WILL NOT LIVE IN FEAR
SHE WILL BE TREATED AS EQUAL
AND SHE WILL KNOW THAT WHAT GAVE HER THOSE PRIVILEGES IN LIFE WAS HER FAMILY'S LEGACY I
AM PROUD I
AM HUMBLE TOO
HOW MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD CAN SAY THAT TO THEIR CHILDREN
HOW MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD DO YOU THINK WOULD
OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER
SHE WAS AN ANCHOR IN MY MOTHER'S LIFE
SOVIET RUSSIA WAS STILL IN POWER WHEN MY MOTHER HAD MY SISTER AND
I SHE SPENT ALL OF HER ENERGY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD ALL OF THE ADVANTAGES IN LIFE
AND BY THAT I DON'T MEAN MONEY
SHE TAUGHT US TO OVERCOME LIMITS
MY MOTHER THE DISCIPLINARIAN ALWAYS PUSHED US JUST A LITTLE BIT HARDER
SHE WORKED FULL TIME BUT SHE SPENT ALL OF HER WAKING MOMENTS MAKING SURE WE WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE ENOUGH TO GET INTO THE BEST SCHOOLS TOOK US TO DANCE AND PIANO LESSONS AND TAUGHT US LANGUAGES HERSELF
WE
STUDIED HARD ALWAYS
BACK THEN I HATED THE FACT WE COULDN'T PLAY AS MUCH AS OTHER KIDS
BUT MY MOTHER'S REMARKABLE
SELF INVESTMENT AND HER FOCUS ON EDUCATION BECAME EVERYTHING
EDUCATION BECAME A
CORNERSTONE FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR ME
I DID NOT KNOW THAT
THEN SO
WITH MY
FAMILY'S SUPPORT AND WITH HELP FROM
EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD
ALONG THE WAY HERE I AM
I'VE BEEN IN THE US FOR 13 YEARS
I'V BEEN A PROUD CITIZEN FOR THREE
NOW I'M A WIFE
AND A MOTHER OF THE MOST AMAZING LITTLE GIRL
TO TOUCH US UP HERE ALWAYS MOVING US TO NEW THOUGHTS AND NEW INNOVATION BUT IT'S WONDERFUL WHEN IT CAN ALSO TOUCH US AT THE HEART LEVEL AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US THAT INNOVATION AND BREAKTHROUGH CAN ALSO INCLUDE THAT DEGREE OF IDEALISM AS
FROM SATISFYING OUR PHYSICAL NEEDS TO SAFETY TO LOVE AND BELONGING
TO SELF ESTEEM AND FINALLY
SELF ACTUALIZATION
BUT ALLOW ME TO ADD JUST
ANOTHER LAYER ON THE VERY TIP OF THAT PYRAMID
DIGNITY
DIGNITY
AS IN TO BE WORTHY OF RESPECT
DIGNITY IS THE FREEDOM TO LIVE OUR LIVES IN THE WAY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO STAND OUT IF WE CHOOSE
WE CAN DO THAT IN AMERICA
DIGNITY IS TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND SAFELY SPEAK UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN
WE CAN DO THAT IN AMERICA
DIGNITY IS BEING JUDGED BY OUR CONTRIBUTIONS AND NOT BY RACE
AGE AGENDA
WE CAN DO THAT IN AMERICA
BUT TO ME AMERICAN DREAM IS THAT PLACE JUST ON THE VERY TIP OF THE MASLOW'S PYRAMID YOU REMEMBER THE MASLOW'S PYRAMID OF HUMAN NEEDS THEY TAUGHT US IN SCHOOL
TO THE HUMAN ANIMAL FOR OUR NEXT PRESENTER SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGIST EKATERINA WALTER SHE DISPELS THE MYTH SOME PEOPLE HAVE THAT BREAKTHROUGH THAT'S THE THEME OF OUR CONFERENCE TODAY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY OR MAYBE EVEN LIKE A
WE COULD ASPIRE FOR WAS CHIEF ACCOUNTANT
IT WAS A TIME WHEN PASSIONATELY DEFENDING SOMETHING YOU BELIEVED IN OR THOUGHT WAS RIGHT WAS NOT A NORM
IT WAS THE TIME OF IDENTICAL UNIFORMS
AND IDENTICAL ATTITUDES
FREEDOM OF RELIGION DID NOT EXIST
DREAMS CAME WITH LIMITS
IT WAS TOUGH THEN
BUT THAT IS HOW MY LEGACY GOT ITS START
LET ME BEGIN BY INTRODUCING YOU TO MY GRANDMOTHER
BEING UNIQUE WAS NOT WELCOMED
BY THE TIME I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
IT BECAME APPARENT I WAS NOT A TYPE OF PERSON TO BLEND IN
I WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD BEYOND THE COLD WAR CURTAIN I WANTED TO SPEAK UP
HECK SPEAK OUT WHEN THE OCCASION CALLED FOR IT WITHOUT THE FEAR OF RETRIBUTION
I WANTED TO PROVE
THE GENDER DIVIDE DID NOT EXIST
I STILL REMEMBER
THE DAY MY FAMILY AND I DISCUSSED THE REMOTE POSSIBILITY OF STUDYING IN THE UNITE STATES
OH WHAT A FEELING THAT WAS THE ADVANTAGES OF AN AMERICAN EDUCATION
FOR A GIRL LIKE ME
AN
AMERICAN DREAM SOUNDS
CLICHE BUT AMERICAN DREAM MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU MY STORY THE STORY OF DEFINING MY AMERICAN DREAM THE
STORY OF MY HERITAGE TOO
ABOUT A MONTH AGO WAS VISITING MY FAMILY IN RUSSIA TAKING MY TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WITH ME AND MY FATHER TOOK THIS
MAJORITIES OVER MINORITIES MASCULINITIES OVER FEMININITIES ABILITIES OVER DISABILITIES
MORE PROVOCATION MORE INSTIGATION FOR WOMEN TO BECOME VIOLENT
WHEN THEY DO IT'S OFTENTIMES IN THE CONTEXT OF A RELATIONSHIP
CHARACTERIZED BY INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE AND VICTIMIZATION
AND DONE IN ACTS OF SELF DEFENSE
YET WHEN WOMEN COME TO US IN PRISON SETTINGS WE OFTENTIMES
THERE ARE BLUEPRINTS FOR DEALING WITH THE DRAMA IN TRAUMA
OF THE THINGS THAT WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THIS IDEA AND THIS NOTION OF CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION
OFTENTIMES THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT COME UP THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WHAT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA BUT DON'T FREAK OUT I
MEANS THAT WE HONESTLY IN THE WORDS OF A NEW FRIEND OF MINE DR STEPHANIE EVANS
WE START WITH WOMEN IN MIND WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE NOT NEARLY AS DANGEROUS AND VIOLENT AS
A BEHAVIORAL PREDICTION
EVERY INMATE HAS TO BE GIVEN A CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION TOOL OR A CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION BEFORE THEY ENTER THAT INSTITUTION BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE REALLY TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE A PROBLEM INSIDE INSTITUTIONS AGAIN THESE ARE THE IDEAL DATA THAT YOU'D WANT TO
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS WE HAVE A MANDATE A LEGAL MANDATE GOVERNED BY
ASSOCIATIONS LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION THAT MANDATE WE HAVE THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS FOR INMATES BASED ON THEIR BEHAVIOUR
THIS IS PROBLEM WHEN WE HAVE THE SAME CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION TOOL USED FOR WOMEN ASSUMING THEY'RE JUST AS DANGEROUS AS MEN
THAT EXIST ACROSS GENDER
IT ALSO MEANS UNDERSTANDING THAT NOT EVERY WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE IN THIS WORLD IS THE SAME
A BLACK WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE IS NOT NEARLY THE SAME AS A WHITE WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE OR LATINA'S EXPERIENCE OR A NATIVE AMERICAN WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE OR EVEN A TRANS GENDERED WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE
BUT AS SOON AS WE START RECOGNIZING THAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE NOT WEAKNESSES BUT STRENGTHS
THE SAFER WE ALL WILL BE
THANK
WE HAVE RESULTS LIKE THIS WE START TO REALISE THAT WE ARE NO LONGER KEEPING WOMEN IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS
EQUALLY WELL FOR WOMEN AS IT IS FOR MEN THE REALITY IN MOST STATES AND MOST
WHO'S TAKING CARE OF ANY KIDS
USUALLY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HER CHILDREN WILL END UP IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM
OR WITH A FAMILY MEMBER IF SHE'S LUCKY AND IF SHE HAS THAT KIND OF SELF SUPPORT AND SOCIAL SUPPORT
MANY WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF SOCIAL SUPPORT
FORTUNATELY THERE ARE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE INSIDE INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN HELP TEACH WOMEN HOW TO ADEQUATELY PARENT THEIR KIDS WHEN THEY COME BACK TO THEM
AND HOW TO ADEQUATELY HANDLE THE PARENTAL STRESS THAT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE IF YOU'RE RAISING CHILDREN
WHEN WE START WITH WOMEN IN
TO SEE EVERY INMATE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AN INMATE IS AN INMATE IS AN INMATE NO MATTER WHAT THEY DID OR WHO THEY ARE
ON THE SURFACE THIS KIND OF CUSTODY APPROACH SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE IF WE TREAT EVERY INMATE THE SAME WAY THEN WE WILL NEVER LITERALLY BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I
WE THINK CORRECTIONAL STAFF HONESTLY AND UNDERSTANDABLY ARE TRAINED TO SEE EVERY INMATE THE SAME WAY
THE SYSTEM FOR BEING PART OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY WEREN'T
BLAMING THE CARDS THAT THEY WERE DEALT IN LIFE FOR THEM BEING IN PRISON THEY WEREN'T BLAMING THE ZIP CODE THAT THEY WERE BORN INTO DO
YOU KNOW WHO THEY WERE BLAMING
THEMSELVES
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU TYPICALLY HEAR AS OFTEN WITH MALE INMATES AND WITH MALE OFFENDERS THEY HAVE LOTS OF SELF DEFEATING ATTITUDES
THE GOOD NEWS IS WOMEN KNOW
AND TREAT INMATES
SAYS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT US AS A SOCIETY
WHILE I SINCERELY AGREE WITH THIS IDEA
I PERSONALLY THINK IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH
SOME INMATES ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN OTHERS AND MORE MARGINALIZED
AND BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A WORLD THAT IMPLICITLY FAVORS SOME GROUPS OVER
THE ATTORNEYS JUDGES LAWYERS IN THE ROOM YOU KNOW THIS IS A MASSIVE LEGAL PROBLEM THESE ARE NOT HYPOTHETICAL DATA THESE DATA DO COME FROM A STATE WHICH WILL REMAIN UNNAMED BECAUSE IT'S A MASSIVE LAWSUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN
THOUGHT OF AT ALL AMONG CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS BUT HERE'S WHY WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT THEM
THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT DIFFERENTLY
THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP CREATE TRAUMA INFORMED CARE EVEN INSIDE PRISONS
IT MEANS ELIMINATING CROSS GENDER PAT DOWNS AND CROSS GENDER STRIP SEARCHES
IT MEANS TRAINING CORRECTIONAL STAFF ON ADEQUATE WAYS OF KNOWING THAT THEIR PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND THE TONE OF THEIR VOICE AFFECTS PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED AND SUFFERED FROM TRAUMA
IT'S USUALLY THE MOTHER WHO'S TAKING CARE OF ANY KIDS WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND
IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR AND TRANS GENDERED WOMEN THE GOOD NEWS
WITH YOU TODAY IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE SAME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR WOMEN AS WE DO FOR MEN
IN ORDER TO KNOW THE PROGRESSION OF HUMANITY WE SHOULDN'T ENTER JUST ANY PRISON WE SHOULD ENTER A WOMEN'S PRISON
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT THE SINGLE MOST
LIKELY TO HAVE A JOB AND A COLLEGE DEGREE
BUT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE FINDINGS ARE THE MOST RECENT
ABECEDARIAN CHILDCARE PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR MID 30S
SHOWED BETTER PHYSICAL HEALTH
THAN
THE QUALITY OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHILDREN DECLINES WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO SUPPORT TEACHERS' WELL BEING SO THAT THEY CAN
LET'S TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF HEAD START TEACHERS HEAD START YOU MAY KNOW IS FEDERAL FUNDED PROGRAM DESIGNED TO EDUCATE SOME CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT ON THE EARLY CHILDHOOD WORKFORCE
BUT THE AMAZING THING
IS WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE LONG TERM RESULTS
FIRST
THERE WERE SOME REAL DISADVANTAGES FOR CHILDREN WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ABECEDARIAN CHILDCARE
PROGRAM BY FOUR YEARS OLD THEY SAW DECLINES IN THEIR IQ
AND IN SCHOOL THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE PLACED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION
ON THE OTHER HAND
BENEFITS NOT ONLY CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BUT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES AND COULD BE
TO BENEFIT FROM SCHOOLS WHERE ALL CHILDREN ARE HEALTHY AND PREPARED TO LEARN INVEST IN HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD
MOST CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS NEXT LANGUAGE A GREAT LESSON FROM THE ABECEDARIAN
MALES DEVELOPED METABOLIC DISORDER IN THEIR MID 30S
HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE
RECEIVED BEFORE FIVE YEARS OLD
IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER HEART HEALTH
IN MID ADULTHOOD
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT
WHAT MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ABECEDARIAN CHILDREN
30 YEARS LATER ONLY A FRACTION OF THE CHILDREN WHO NEED HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS HAVE ACCESS TO THEM WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY
WE HAVE THE INSTRUCTIONS ASSEMBLY IS REQUIRED WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR THANK
ALL OF WHOM LIVED IN POVERTY
WERE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF TWO EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS
BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED BASIC SUPPORTS SUCH AS DIAPERS AND FORMULA
BUT ONLY ONE OF THE GROUPS THE ABECEDARIAN GROUP
RECEIVED FULL DAY YEAR ROUND INTENSIVE CHILD CARE
THE
TO WORK TO TRY TO HELP EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHERS ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN
AND A PROCESS THAT IS EASILY THWARTED
BY POVERTY AND STRESS
HEALTHY CHILDREN DO NOT COME PREASSEMBLED
WORK
IS REQUIRED
THIS STORY BEGINS
WITH 100 NORTH CAROLINA BABIES
AND THEIR AMAZING JOURNEY
THEIR LIFE TRAJECTORIES WERE CHANGED BY A SINGLE
TO THEIR PASSAGE THEY LEFT BEHIND MYSTERIOUS ENGRAVINGS AND PAINTINGS
CLOSE CONTACT FOR A MESSAGE TO BE SENT AND RECEIVED
AND AFTER THE MOMENT OF TRANSMISSION
IT'S GONE FOREVER
GRAPHIC COMMUNICATION ON THE OTHER HAND DECOUPLES THAT RELATIONSHIP
AND WITH ITS INVENTION IT BECAME POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME
FOR A MESSAGE TO BE TRANSMITTED AND PRESERVED BEYOND A SINGLE MOMENT IN PLACE AND
THE SAME SIGNS APPEARING IN SUCH FAR FLUNG PLACES
ESPECIALLY IN THAT 30000 TO 40000 YEAR RANGE
IT'S STARTING TO SEEM INCREASINGLY LIKELY
THAT THIS INVENTION ACTUALLY TRACES BACK TO A COMMON POINT OF ORIGIN IN AFRICA BUT
THAT I'M AFRAID IS A SUBJECT FOR A FUTURE TALK
SO BACK TO THE MATTER AT HAND
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT THESE SIGNS WERE MEANINGFUL TO THEIR
CERTAIN SIGNS SPAN THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS OTHER SIGNS HAD MUCH MORE RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS WITH SOME BEING LIMITED TO A SINGLE
OF THE THINGS I FIND MOST FASCINATING ABOUT STUDYING OUR DEEP HISTORY
THOSE PEOPLE
DIDN'T HAVE THE SHOULDERS OF ANY GIANTS TO STAND ON THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL SHOULDERS
AND WHILE A SURPRISING NUMBER OF IMPORTANT INVENTIONS COME OUT OF THAT DISTANT TIME
WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS THE INVENTION OF GRAPHIC COMMUNICATION
NOT ENOUGH CHARACTERS AT THIS POINT TO HAVE REPRESENTED ALL OF THE WORDS IN THE SPOKEN LANGUAGE SOMETHING WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT FOR A FULL WRITING SYSTEM
PRONOUNS ADVERBS ADJECTIVES
SO KNOWING ALL THIS
IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THE GEOMETRIC SIGNS FROM ICE AGE EUROPE WERE TRULY ABSTRACT WRITTEN CHARACTERS
INSTEAD WHAT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY
IS THAT THESE EARLY ARTISTS WERE ALSO MAKING COUNTING MARKS
THE LEVEL OF ACCURACY I KNEW I WAS GOING TO NEED IF I WANTED TO START ANSWERING THOSE LARGER QUESTIONS SO LET'S GET TO THOSE
THEM HADN'T BEEN VISITED IN HALF A CENTURY OR MORE
THESE WERE THE ONES THAT I TARGETED FOR MY FIELD WORK
OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS MY FAITHFUL HUSBAND DYLAN AND I
EACH SPENT OVER 300 HOURS UNDERGROUND
HIKING CRAWLING AND WRIGGLING
THROUGH THE PORTAL BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK YOU ENTER A SUBTERRANEAN WORLD
FEELING THAT MY NEXT STEP WILL INVOLVE BREAKING IT BACK APART AS DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMAGERY ARE IDENTIFIED AND SEPARATED OFF
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG THE LATER CREATION OF FULLY DEVELOPED WRITING WAS AN IMPRESSIVE FEAT IN ITS OWN RIGHT
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE EARLY WRITING SYSTEMS DIDN'T COME OUT OF A VACUUM
AND THAT EVEN 5000 YEARS AGO PEOPLE WERE ALREADY BUILDING ON SOMETHING MUCH OLDER
WITH ITS ORIGINS STRETCHING BACK TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO THE GEOMETRIC SIGNS OF ICE AGE EUROPE AND FAR BEYOND
TO THAT POINT
DEEP IN OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY
WHEN SOMEONE FIRST CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF MAKING A GRAPHIC MARK
AND FOREVER CHANGED THE NATURE OF HOW WE COMMUNICATE
INTERESTED IN IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN MIND OF THE EVOLUTION OF CREATIVITY OF IMAGINATION OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT
IS A VERY SMALL NUMBER NOW IF THESE WERE RANDOM DOODLES OR DECORATIONS WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE LOT MORE VARIATION BUT INSTEAD WHAT WE FIND ARE THE SAME SIGNS REPEATING ACROSS BOTH SPACE AND TIME
IN A CAVE I OFTEN FIND MYSELF WONDERING
WHAT DROVE THESE PEOPLE TO GO SO DEEP
TO BRAVE DANGEROUS AND NARROW PASSAGEWAYS TO LEAVE THEIR MARK
IN THIS VIDEO CLIP THAT WAS SHOT HALF A KILOMETER OR ABOUT A THIRD OF A MILE UNDERGROUND IN THE CAVE OF CUDON IN SPAIN
WE FOUND A SERIES OF RED PAINTINGS ON A CEILING IN A PREVIOUSLY UNEXPLORED SECTION OF THE CAVE
AS WE CRAWLED FORWARD MILITARY STYLE WITH THE CEILING GETTING EVER LOWER
WE FINALLY GOT TO A POINT WHERE THE CEILING WAS SO LOW
THAT MY HUSBAND AND PROJECT PHOTOGRAPHER DYLAN COULD NO LONGER ACHIEVE FOCUS ON THE CEILING WITH HIS DSLR CAMERA
SO WHILE HE FILMED ME
I KEPT FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF RED PAINT WITH A SINGLE LIGHT AND A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA THAT WE KEPT FOR THAT TYPE OF OCCASION
THE WORST AND PROBABLY MOST DIFFICULT DAY IN MY LIFE WAS SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988 I WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD
AND MY MOTHER AND I WERE IN THE KITCHEN IN OUR HOUSE IN LONDON WE'D JUST GOTTEN BACK FROM A WEDDING IN NIGERIA
AND MY BROTHER AND MY FATHER WERE STILL IN NIGERIA A FEW DAYS AFTER THE WEDDING FOR A ROAD TRIP A FATHER AND SON ROAD TRIP AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME HOME ON SEPTEMBER 3RD 1988 WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK THEM UP FROM THE AIRPORT
AND WE WERE WAITING AND WAITING I GUESS WE ASSUMED THEY'D MISSED THEIR FLIGHT WE CONTINUED TO WAIT WE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
AND THEN LATER ON THAT DAY MY MOTHER GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A FAMILY FRIEND IN NIGERIA
AND THE VOICE ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE JUST BASICALLY SAID YOU KNOW YOUR HUSBAND AND YOUR SON HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A CAR CRASH ONE OF THEM IS DEAD AND WE DON'T KNOW WHICH
WAS A RECEPTIONIST AND I REALLY WANTED TO SORT OF MOVE UP WITHIN THE COMPANY
AND NO MATTER HOW HARD I WORKED I COULDN'T GET PROMOTED
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I STAYED LATE OR CAME IN ON THE WEEKENDS HOPING THAT MY BOSS WOULD NOTICE ME AND PROMOTE ME IT NEVER HAPPENED
AND IN FACT FOR THE
POSITION I WANTED THEY BEGAN LOOKING FOR EXTERNAL CANDIDATES I'M SURE ANYONE WHO'S BEEN THROUGH THAT KNOWS HOW THAT CAN BE
AND BECAUSE I WAS THE RECEPTIONIST IT WAS MY JOB TO SERVE WATER TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING IN TO INTERVIEW FOR THE JOB THAT I WANTED
SO I
DIDN'T REALLY
NECESSARILY FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF BECAUSE OF THAT I DID SOME SOUL SEARCHING AND I ASKED MYSELF WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IN LIFE CLEARLY THIS IS PROBABLY NOT MEANT FOR YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
I'D ALWAYS BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT BROADCAST JORNALISM
SO I CALLED A TELEVISION STATION IN NEW YORK A LOCAL NEWS STATION AND I ASKED THEM WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO GET A JOB WITH YOU GUYS
SO UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE
THEY NEEDED ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AS A REPORTER AND THE ONLY EXPERIENCE I REALLY HAD WAS ANSWERING PHONES AND SENDING FAXES THAT'S ALL I REALLY KNEW HOW TO DO
AND SO THEY SAID NO REPEATEDLY TO ME AND ON TOP OF THAT I HAD A BRITISH ACCENT AND IN AMERICA IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE LOCAL NEWS BUSINESS
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IF YOU HAVE A FOREIGN
BETTER
THAN OTHERS I GUESS
AND SO THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM BEING A SPORTS REPORTER TO BEING A POLITICAL REPORTER OR A BUSINESS REPORTER AND I WAS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT BUSINESS NEWS
SO WHILE I WAS WORKING IN LOCAL NEWS I DECIDED TO STUDY AND TEACH MYSELF BUSINESS NEWS
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY COMING MY WAY OR THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS PREPARING FOR BUT BECAUSE I TRUSTED THAT ONE DAY AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD COME
AND I NEEDED TO BE READY
SO THIS HAD A PRETTY DEEP IMPACT ON ME BECAUSE I'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF CEOS FOR CNN AND I'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF FOUNDERS FOR TECH START UPS SOME OF WHOM HAVE MADE MILLIONS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS USUALLY WHAT THEY SAY IS IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED TO NETWORK HAVE BRAND STUDY YOUR COMPETITION
AND SHE HAD SOME PRACTICAL ADVICE AS WELL
BUT SUDDENLY THE MORAL OF HER STORY WAS THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE YOU RECEIVE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE TRIED IT I'VE TESTED IT AND I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE IN GIVING JUST TO RECEIVE
BUT SHE IS RIGHT THE MORE YOU GIVE
THE MORE YOU RECEIVE
I MENTIONED THAT FOUR FOUR AND HALF YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING AS A RECEPTIONIST AND I WAS IN PRODUCTION COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA
EVERY WEEKEND I WENT TO THE LIBRARY ONE WEEKEND I'D STUDY STOCKS
THE NEXT WEEKEND I'D STUDY BONDS THE NEXT WEEKEND DERIVATIVES THE NEXT WEEKEND
MERGES AND ACQUISITIONS TEACHING MYSELF AND IN FACT THE LIBRARIANS ON 33RD WITH MADISON IN NEW YORK GOT TO KNOW ME VERY WELL BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES I'D BE THE LAST PERSON TO LEAVE
SO AFTER DOING THAT FOR FEW YEARS EVENTUALLY BY PURE CHANCE I HAPPENED TO MEET AN EXECUTIVE AT CNN AND I ASKED HIM WHICH DEPARTMENT HE WORKED IN
HE SAID HE RAN THE BUSINESS NEWS UNIT AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A REPORTER
SO WHEN I MET HIM HE GAVE ME ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO COME IN FOR SCREEN TEST
AND ALSO FOR A FINANCIAL NEWS TEST AS WELL
SO IN HIS MIND HE FELT GUILTY BECAUSE HE ONLY HAD GIVEN ME TWO WEEKS TO PREPARE
BUT IN MY MIND I KNEW IN MY HEART I HAD BEEN PREPARING FOR YEARS
SO THIS IS A LESSON AS WELL THAT I HAD LEARNED FROM MY OLDER BROTHER SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY APPROACHED ME ABOUT HIM BUT MY OLDER BROTHER IS AN ACTOR AND HE STARED IN A MOVIE THAT CAME OUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR CALLED TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE
HE WAS NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR FOR BEST ACTOR AND I'D LEARNED THIS LESSON FROM
SO TO SUM UP I TRULY BELIEVE IN TRUSTING YOUR STRUGGLE KNOWING
WENT IN FOR THE SCREEN TEST FIRST I CAME OUT AND I TOLD HER EVERYTHING THEY ASKED ME
AND HOW SHE SHOULD PREPARE
SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMPETITION I BELIEVE IN CREATING WHAT I WANT I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMPETING FOR WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN CREATED
THE THIRD THING I HONESTLY BELIEVE IS
TO GIVE
BECAUSE IT
HAS BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME IN LIFE
THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE
THE MORE YOU RECEIVE
UNFORTUNATELY LOT OF THESE NEWS STATIONS RECEIVE THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS THOUSANDS OF TAPES SO IT TOOK THEM SEVERAL MONTHS TO GET BACK TO ME
AND DURING THAT TIME THE RECESSION KICKED IN AND I LOST MY JOB
SO THERE I WAS NO MONEY NO JOB SO
I DECIDED ANYWAY THAT I WAS GOING TO MOVE TO NEW YORK AND JUST HOPE
THAT THIS ONE STATION WOULD GET BACK TO ME
SO EVENTUALLY AFTER EMAILING AND PESTERING CONSTANTLY THEY EVENTUALLY GOT BACK TO ME THEY BROUGHT ME IN FOR AN INTERVIEW AND THEY WERE SO IMPRESSED THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD NO EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD PUT TOGETHER THIS
TAPE BY MYSELF SHOWING WHAT I COULD DO THAT THEY HIRED ME ON THE
SPOT
SO THAT'S WHY I
SAY TRUST YOUR STRUGGLE
THE SECOND THING I BELIEVE AND THIS SORT OF COMES OUT OF LEFT FIELD IS I HONESTLY DO
FOUR FOUR AND HALF YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING AS A RECEPTIONIST AND THE REASON WHY I SHARE THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT SUCCESS IS NEVER REALLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE
BUMPS ALONG THE WAY
FOR THE LONGEST TIME IN MY LIFE I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HARD WORK WAS A KEY TO SUCCESS I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU WORK HARD OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL
BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THE STORY THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT IN THEIR CHOSEN CAREERS
THERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTRAODINARILY TALENTED WHO KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL EDUCATED WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT SO IF IT'S NOT ALWAYS HARD WORK WHAT THEN DETERMINES WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AS I INTEND TO ANSWER THIS I'LL SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY LIFE AND MY BACKGROUND I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN LONDON MY FAMILY AND I WE'RE ORIGINALLY FROM
FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT
I ALSO BELIEVE IN TURNING A BLIND EYE TO COMPETITION
I BELIEVE IN GIVING
AND I BELIEVE IN TRUSTING AND KNOWING THAT YOUR OPPORTUNITY WILL ONE DAY COME
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE READY
THANK YOU
FOR THAT AND THEN NO TELEVISION EXPANDED INTO NO PHONES NO CABLE NO MUSIC I LITERALLY HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT STUDY AND
MY MOTHER SAID TO ME IF YOU'RE LIVING IN MY HOUSE THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO WATCH TELEVISION AGAIN
IS IF YOU GET INTO OXFORD
SO
I REALLY LAUGH NOW AND IT IS FUNNY BUT YOU KNOW HER PLAN WORKED I WORKED VERY HARD I GOT STRAIGHT A'S AND I WENT TO OXFORD
SO OVERALL I DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE EASIEST CHILDHOOD I WAS RAISED IN A SINGLE PARENT FAMILY WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AND THEREFORE I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE FRIENDS I DIDN'T HAVE THE EASIEST CHILDHOOD BUT I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT BECAUSE IT PREPARED ME FOR
YOU HAVE HOOTERS IN ENGLAND
BUT IT'S A RESTAURANT CHAIN IN AMERICA WHERE THE WAITRESSES ARE VERY SCANTILY CLAD THAT'S HOW SHE STARTED OFF
AND I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE TRANSITION FROM GOING FROM THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE GREW UP POOR AND HER
MOTHER SAVED TEN DOLLARS A WEEK FOR FOOD TO NOW BEING A CEO
AND ESPECIALLY FINANCIALLY I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THAT WAS LIKE FOR HER SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT FELT LIKE TO HAVE MONEY EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS BEING WELL PAID
BECAUSE SHE STILL GIVES MOST OF HER MONEY AWAY TILL THIS DAY
BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR TO HER THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE IN LIFE THE MORE YOU RECEIVE
SO
THE CAR CRASH HAPPENED IN NIGERIA AND THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE IN THE CAR EVERYONE IN THE CAR DIED INSTANTLY APART FROM ONE PERSON IN THE BACK SEAT WHERE MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER WERE SITTING IT TURNED OUT TO BE MY FATHER WHO DIED
MY MOTHER WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF COURSE SHE WAS DEVASTATED BECAUSE MY PARENTS WERE REALLY THE LOVES OF EACH OTHER'S
SO MULTI TOUCH INTERACTION RESEARCH IS A VERY ACTIVE FIELD RIGHT NOW IN HCI I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE DOING IT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE GETTING INTO IT THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO LET EVEN MORE
ALL THIS COMPUTE POWER TO MAKE THINGS DO THE RIGHT THINGS INTUITIVE THINGS TO DO EXACTLY
BILL BUXTON HAVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH IT IN THE 80S HOWEVER THE APPROACH I BUILT HERE IS ACTUALLY HIGH RESOLUTION LOW COST AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY VERY SCALABLE
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR LONG TIME WE HAVE ALL THIS GREAT DATA BUT FOR SOME REASON IT'S JUST SITTING THERE WE'RE NOT ACCESSING IT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK THAT IS WILL BE
THERE WE TOOK THE PROTONS AND THE NEUTRONS WE SMASHED THEM INTO EACH OTHER AND WE FOUND THAT THEY'RE MADE OF QUARKS AND WE'RE STILL ON THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO FIND ALL OF THESE SMALLEST PARTICLES OF THE
NOW WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS IN SCIENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE AFTER THE QUESTIONS OF WHY DID SOMETHING HAPPEN WHY DIT IT HAPPEN THIS WAY WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
AROUND THIS TED SAYS WELL WE'RE REALLY JUST A COLLECTION OF ATOMS I'M MADE OF ATOMS I HAVE DNA AND THE REDUCTIONIST IDEA WOULD SAY
THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHY IS IT HARD WHAT'S IN THIS ROCK IS CALCIUM AND CARBON AND OXYGEN OKAY AND SO THE REDUCTIONIST PHILOSOPHY WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS HARD BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF CALCIUM CARBON AND OXYGEN
A BECAUSE SHE IS MARSHMALLOW IS IT B BECAUSE SHE IS A CAT OR DOES SHE HAVE FUR BECAUSE C SHE IS A MAMMAL NOW WE'RE
JUST WANT TO TALK AS ONE HUMAN TO ANOTHER I THINK THIS OPENS UP YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING QUESTION OF WHO REALLY ARE
REDUCTIONISM IDEA REALLY IS JUST PHILOSOPHY IT WAS HANDED DOWN TO US BY THE GREEKS IT'S A WAY OF GAINING KNOWLEDGE THAT'S GOTTEN US A LOT OF MILEAGE BUT IT CAN'T NECESSARILY BE USED TO ANSWER EVERY
SULFUR IN IT INSTEAD
SO IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY THAT THIS ROCK IS HARD BECAUSE IT HAS CARBON IN IT OR THAT THIS ROCK IS HARD BECAUSE IT HAS SULFUR IN IT THERE'S SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE HUNKS OF MATTER THAT TRANSCENDS THE ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL ATOMS THAT MAKE THEM UP
IN FACT THE REASON THAT THEY'RE
THE WAVE HAPPENS IT LOOKS MORE LESS THE SAME AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THE FANS ARE
IT'S TOO COMPLEX TO APPLY REDUCTIONISM TO IT WELL
IN A WAVE YOU'VE PARTICIPATED IN A COLLECTIVE PHENOMENON THAT WAS EMERGENT
OKAY NOW ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EMERGENT COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR GOING ON
IS THAT THE BEHAVIOR WHEN IT RISES AT THE LEVEL OF THE COLLECTION OF PARTICLES HAS SOME PROPERTIES TO IT THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUENTS
THIS ROCK HAS SULFUR IN IT THERE'S A LARGER ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT EXPLANATION IS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN WAVES IN OTHER CONTEXTS I'VE SEEN WAVES HAPPEN ON WATER RIGHT NOW YOU'RE HEARING MY VOICE BECAUSE OF COMPRESSIONAL WAVES IN THE AIR THAT ARE CARRYING THE SOUNDS TO YOUR
INSIDE OF THE METAL ARE LIQUID BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT INSIDE OF AN INSULATOR LIKE PLASTIC PLASTIC DOESN'T HAVE CURRENT FLOWED THROUGH IT THE ELECTRONS ARE STUCK IN THERE AND THE ELECTRONS ARE SOLID LIKE IN THAT TYPE OF MATERIAL SO ELECTRONS INSIDE OF MATERIALS HAVE THEIR OWN PHASES OF MATTER THEIR OWN PHASE TRANSITIONS AND IN FACT THEY HAVE MANY MANY MORE PHASES OF MATTER THAN
OF PHASES OF MATTER AND PHASE TRANSITIONS WE ALSO STUDY WHAT ELECTRONS DO INSIDE OF SOLIDS IT TURNS OUT THAT ELECTRONS INSIDE OF MATERIALS HAVE THEIR OWN PHASES OF MATTER AND THEIR OWN PHASE
HAIR YOU'LL HAVE I CAN EVEN PREDICT WHO YOU'LL BE AS A PERSON AND WHY DO YOU LIKE KETCHUP OR MUSTARD
OKAY
BUT THAT IDEA THAT YOU AS A HUMAN ARE DETERMINED BY YOUR ATOMS AND BY YOUR DNA THAT'S A REDUCTIONIST IDEA
AND WE
{NS} WHAT MAKES A PHYSICAL LAW FUNDAMENTAL HOW DO WE GO ABOUT FINDING THE DEEPEST AND TRUEST THINGS ABOUT OUR UNIVERSE FOR CENTURIES WE AS PHYSICISTS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING THIS FROM THE POINT OF
SCALE OF THE COLLECTION OF PARTICLES COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR THAT TRANSCENDS
DID LEONARDO DA VINCI MAKE HER SMILE WITH HER EYES
NOW REDUCTIONISM GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW TO TACKLE THAT QUESTION REDUCTIONISM WOULD SAY OKAY THE WAY TO TACKLE THAT QUESTION IS TO START WITH THE COLORS LET'S LOOK AT THE COLORS WITH WHICH SHE'S PAINTED AND LET'S DO A
CLUE THAT YOU HAVE EMERGENT BEHAVIOR HAPPENING NOW I THINK THIS IDEA OF
THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING IT UP IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE IT'S AN EMERGENT PHENOMENON
REALLY ARE WE ARE WE REDUCIBLE TO OUR ATOMS OR ARE YOU JUST YOUR ATOMS
OR IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE MONA LISA'S SMILE TRANSCENDS HER PIGMENTS
IS IT POSIBLE THAT THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES TRANCENDS YOUR ATOMS ARE YOU JUST A COLLECTION OF ATOMS AND DNA
OR ARE YOU MORE THAN YOUR ATOMS
ROOM FLOWS INTO THE LIVING ROOM IT MUST BE BECAUSE OF THE PARTICULAR BRICKS THEY USED THAT WOULDN'T QUIET BE CORRECT RIGHT THE
IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING LARGE SCALE BEHAVIOR AND YOU DO NEED MANY MANY PARTICLES IN ORDER TO OBSERVE THE PHASE TRANSITION
WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING COLLECTIONS OF MANY PARTICLES OFTEN THERE IS BEHAVIOR THAT PRESENTS ITSELF
IN THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF PARTICLES COLLECTIVE
I CAN BUILD THEM BACK UP AND RECONSTRUCT EVERYTHING MAYBE I CAN GET A THEORY OF EVERYTHING AND THEN PREDICT WHAT CAN BE KNOWN ABOUT THE UNIVERSE NOW
THERE'S ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT PIECE OF THE IDEA AND
THAT IS THAT REDUCTIONISM CAN'T ANSWER EVERY
BEING 60 MILES SOUTH OF THE RAPID CITY BORDER AND WELL WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF WIND CAVE NATIONAL PARK
IT ALSO IMPACTS OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION
SECRETE A NATURALLY OCCURRING HORMONE CALLED MELATONIN THE GREAT THING ABOUT MELATONIN IS IT HAS GREAT ANTIOXIDANT QUALITIES THAT RID OUR BRAIN AND BODY OF FREE RADICALS THAT CAUSE DAMAGE TO OUR BRAIN AND BODY
JUST IN ORDER TO GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
IF SO THAT IS BECAUSE OF LIGHT TRESPASS THE SHINING OF LIGHT WHERE IT'S UNNEEDED AND UNINTENDED AND UNWANTED
FROM ANOTHER SOURCE ORIGINATING SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN YOUR OWN
OR TURNED OFF COMPLETELY AND FOUND THAT IT HAD NO IMPACT ON TRAFFIC COLLISIONS OR CRIME
IN THEIR EYES THEY HAVE LIGHT DETECTING RODS THAT ARE NUMBERED AT ONE MILLION RODS PER SQUARE MILLIMETER
JUST BECAUSE WE CAN SEE WITH LIGHTS AT NIGHT
DOESN'T MEAN OTHER CREATURES CAN
BUT EVEN THOUGH WE CAN SEE WITH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT NIGHT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S HEALTHY FOR
100 YEARS AGO ALL CREATURES COULD LOOK UP AND SEE A SPECTACULAR STARRY NIGHT SKY BUT NOW EIGHT OUT OF TEN CHILDREN WILL NEVER SEE THE MILKY WAY FROM WHERE THEY LIVE
THEN YOU LOOK UP AND YOU REALIZE YOU CAN SEE RELATIVELY VERY FEW STARS YOU CANNOT EVEN SEE THE BIG DIPPER SO YOU PACK UP ALL YOUR BELONGINGS YOU GET IN THE CAR YOU DRIVE TO THE CITY LIMITS WHERE
THAT LIGHT POLLUTION COULD POSSIBLY BE THE SIMPLEST PROBLEM TO SOLVE AND COULD LITERALLY BE DONE OVERNIGHT SIMPLY WITH THE FLIP OF A SWITCH SO
ONLY EIGHT YEARS IT'S ESTIMATED THAT JUST EIGHT DARK SKY PLACES WILL REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES
CITY IS NOT ALONE LIGHT POLLUTION PLAGUES EVERY MODERN CITY AND TOWN THE GOOD NEWS HOWEVER
CANNOT SEE THE MILKY WAY
YOU KEEP ON DRIVING YOU GO DEEP INTO THE BLACK HILLS NATIONAL FOREST
AND THEN YOU SEE IT
THE SKY GLOW THE MEADOWLARK WAS SINGING TOWARD
TO GET TO A NATURALLY DARK SKY YOU WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE TWO
IF WE ALL TURN OUT OUR LIGHTS MORE IS NEEDED TO BE DONE
AND AS ADULTS WE DO THAT NOW ON A MUCH GRANDER SCALE
WASTING MONEY AND CREATING MORE CARBON EMISSIONS
AS CHILDREN WE'RE AFRAID OF THE DARK SO WE FLIP ON A NIGHT SWITCH
EXPOSURE TO ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT NIGHT HAS BEEN LINKED TO AN INCREASE IN ALZHEIMER'S BREAST CANCER OBESITY AND DEPRESSION
FOR MEADOWLARKS TO SING TOWARD THE RISING SUN
LIGHTING WASTES 30 PERCENT OF LIGHT THAT GOES OUTWARD AND UPWARD WHERE IT IS NOT NEEDED OR
NATURALLY LIT SKY WHERE THE STARS FROM THE MILKY WAY SHINE SO BRIGHT IT WILL CAST A SHADOW OF YOU ON THE GROUND
LIGHTING AND THE OVER ILLUMINATION OF RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS BUSINESS SIGNAGE AND STREET LIGHTS BRIGHTEN OUR NIGHT SKY CREATING AN ORANGE
SHIFT OUR FOCUS TO NOCTURNAL PLANTS
HERE'S A HINT YOU CAN ASK YOUR NEIGHBOR TO SHUT OFF THEIR LIGHT AS WELL IF THEIR LIGHT IS TRESPASSING INTO YOUR AREA AND
ONE HOUR PAST THE LAST EMPLOYEE'S DEPARTURE TIME I CHALLENGE
ANOTHER IDEA HOLD ON WITH ME THIS IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER
NEED TO PROTECT NOCTURNAL HABITATS STARGAZING OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR NOCTURNAL PLANTS AND ANIMALS
AND COMMUNITY HEALTH LOOKED AT STATISTICS WHERE RESEARCHERS STUDIED LIGHTS
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED ATTRACTING A MATE BY CALLING THEM AT 2 AM
OR BETTER YET FOR THREE DAYS TO THE NEAREST TOWN OR STATE LINE
I DESTROYED 8 PAIRS OF SHOES AND I WALKED ALONG
NOT INVESTING IN LANES ON OUR CONGESTED
INVESTING IN SAFE AND CREATIVE PUBLIC RESTROOMS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAVELING ON FOOT
THE NEXT MORNING WE SHARED BREAKFAST AND I WAS ON MY WAY AND I'LL NEVER FORGET LOOKING BACK AND SAYING FAREWELL TO MY TRUE FIRST TRAIL ANGEL NOW FOREVER FRIEND
TO PROCESS THOUGHTS THIS WAY OUR SENSE OF PLACE AND AWARENESS ISN'T EQUIPPED TO DAILY BYPASS THE SPACES BETWEEN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR HOMES BETWEEN OUR HOMES AND OUR WORKPLACES
AND NATIONAL PRESS AND I GENERATED JUST OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS FOR ENTREPRENEURS ALL OVER THE WORLD
AND I ASKED YOU TO WALK WITH ME FOR TWO HOURS IN ONE
BIT IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES SHE OFFERED TO HOST MY DOG AND ME
ADVOCATE FOR BETTER HEALTH
SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS
AND THRIVING ECOSYSTEMS WHEN THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND THEM
DAILY GETS FILTERED BY SPEEDS THAT DEFY OUR OWN DESIGN
I'M NOT HERE TO PREACH AN ANTI CAR CAMPAIGN
I LOVE THE LONG ROAD TRIP JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE
THAT SAID
MANY OF US EXIST IN THE MADNESS WITHOUT BLINKING AN EYE WITHOUT QUESTIONING WITHOUT BEING CONCERNED
HOW OFTEN IF EVER DO WE CONSIDER THE ROLE OUR TRANSPORTATION HABITS HAVE
ON OUR NATIONALLY INCLINING LEVELS OF OBESITY AND DEPRESSION
IN THE RAIN WITH THE OTHER THIS WAS REALLY STRANGE AS I GOT CLOSER I WAS COMFORTED BY HER WARM SMILE SHE SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING AND ASKED IF SHE COULD WALK WITH
YOUR OWN FUTURE HELL I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY
OF JUST EXPLAINING TO YOU WHY I INTENT TO DO WHAT I DO I'D LIKE TO TAKE MY CRAFT AND PERFORM A POEM FOR YOU THAT I WROTE FOR THIS CAN I DO THAT CAN I GIVE IT TO YOU AS A POEM IS THAT COOL
IF MONEY HAD NO VALUE TELL ME WHAT WOULD YOU CHASE
SO NOW I'D LIKE YOU TO IMAGINE PLAYING VERY DIFFERENT ROLE THAT OF THE SCOUT
AND DREYFUS WAS FOUND GUILTY AND AFTERWARDS THEY TOOK HIM
ALL YOU'VE REALLY SHOWN PIQUART IS THAT THERE IS ANOTHER SPY WHO LEARNED HOW TO MIMIC DREYFUS'S HANDWRITING AND HE PICKED UP THE TORCH OF SPYING AFTER DREYFUS LEFT BUT DREYFUS IS STILL GUILTY EVENTUALLY PIQUART MANAGED TO GET DREYFUS
BROUGHT THESE DISCOVERIES TO HIS SUPERIORS BUT TO HIS DISMAY THEY EITHER DIDN'T CARE OR CAME UP WITH ELABORATE RATIONALIZATIONS TO EXPLAIN HIS FINDINGS
AND WAS KNOWN FOR HAVING A GOOD MEMORY WHICH WAS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS RIGHT YOU KNOW BECAUSE A SPY HAS TO REMEMBER A LOT OF THINGS SO THE CASE WENT TO
IS EMOTIONAL
SO
JUST AS THE SOLDIER MINDSET IS ROOTED IN EMOTIONS LIKE
DEFENSIVENESS OR TRIBALISM
SCOUT MINDSET IS TOO IT'S JUST ROOTED IN DIFFERENT EMOTIONS
SO FOR EXAMPLE SCOUTS ARE CURIOUS
THEY'RE MORE
MINDSET YOU KNOW WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE SOMETIMES AT LEAST ABLE TO CUT THROUGH THEIR OWN
HIS ACTIONS MORE ADMIRABLE TO ME BECAUSE HE HAD THE SAME PREJUDICES THE SAME REASONS TO BE BIASED AS HIS FELLOW OFFICERS BUT HIS MOTIVATION TO FIND THE TRUTH AND UPHOLD IT JUST TRUMPED ALL OF
TO HOW RIGHT OR WRONG THEY ARE ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR TOPIC
SO YOU KNOW THEY CAN BELIEVE THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WORKS AND IF STUDIES COME OUT SHOWING THAT IT DOESN'T THEY CAN SAY HUH LOOKS LIKE MIGHT BE WRONG
DOESN'T MEAN I'M BAD OR STUPID SO
THESE TRAITS THIS CLUSTER OF TRAITS IS WHAT RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND AND I'VE ALSO FOUND ANECDOTALLY PREDICTS GOOD JUDGMENT
AND THE KEY TAKEAWAY I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ABOUT THOSE TRAITS IS THAT
THEY'RE PRIMARILY NOT ABOUT HOW SMART YOU ARE OR ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU KNOW
IN FACT THEY DON'T CORRELATE VERY MUCH WITH IQ AT ALL
THEY'RE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL
SO THERE'S A QUOTE THAT I KEEP COMING BACK TO BY SAINT EXUPERY HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE LITTLE PRINCE AND
THAT WHEN THE REFEREE JUDGES THAT YOUR TEAM COMMITTED A FOUL FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO FIND REASONS WHY HE'S WRONG BUT IF HE JUDGES THAT THE OTHER TEAM COMMITTED A FOUL AWESOME THAT'S A GOOD CALL LET'S NOT
INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT THE DREYFUS AFFAIR IS THIS QUESTION OF WHY THE OFFICERS WERE SO CONVINCED THAT DREYFUS WAS GUILTY
MEAN YOU MIGHT EVEN ASSUME THAT THEY WERE SETTING HIM UP THEY WERE INTENTIONALLY FRAMING HIM BUT HISTORIANS DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THE OFFICERS GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT THE CASE AGAINST DREYFUS WAS STRONG
WHICH
YOU KNOW MAKES YOU WONDER
WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE HUMAN MIND THAT WE CAN FIND SUCH PALTRY EVIDENCE TO BE COMPELLING ENOUGH TO CONVICT A MAN
WELL
THIS IS A CASE OF WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL MOTIVATED REASONING
{NS} SO I'D LIKE YOU TO IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU ARE SOLDIER IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE MAYBE YOU'RE A ROMAN FOOT SOLDIER
TO ME PIQUART IS A POSTER CHILD FOR WHAT I CALL SCOUT MINDSET
IN THE ARMY AND UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME THE FRENCH ARMY WAS HIGHLY ANTI SEMITIC
SO THEY COMPARED DREYFUS'S HANDWRITING TO THAT ON THE MEMO
AND INCLUDED THAT IT WAS A MATCH EVEN THOUGH OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL HANDWRITING EXPERTS WERE MUCH LESS CONFIDENT IN THE SIMILARITY BUT NEVER MIND THAT
THEY WENT AND SEARCHED DREYFUS'S APARTMENT LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF ESPIONAGE THEY WENT THROUGH HIS FILES
AND THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING
AND THIS JUST CONVINCED THEM MORE THAT DREYFUS WAS NOT ONLY GUILTY BUT SNEAKY AS WELL BECAUSE CLEARLY HE HAD HIDDEN ALL OF THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THEY HAD MANAGED TO GET TO IT
NEXT THEY WENT AND LOOKED THROUGH HIS PERSONAL HISTORY FOR ANY INCRIMINATING DETAILS THEY TALKED TO HIS TEACHERS THEY FOUND THAT HE HAD STUDIED FOREIGN LANGUAGES IN SCHOOL WHICH CLEARLY SHOWED DESIRE TO CONSPIRE WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS LATER IN
LIFE HIS TEACHERS ALSO SAID THAT
ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SAY THAT THEY THINK IT'S VIRTUOUS TO TEST YOUR OWN BELIEFS
AND AS SOCIETIES
WHAT WE NEED MOST IS NOT MORE INSTRUCTION IN LOGIC OR RHETORIC OR PROBABILITY OR ECONOMICS EVEN THOUGH THOSE THINGS ARE QUITE VALUABLE BUT WHAT WE MOST NEED TO USE THOSE PRINCIPLES WELL IS SCOUT MINDSET
WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE FEEL
WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FEEL PROUD INSTEAD OF ASHAMED WHEN WE NOTICE WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING
WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FEEL INTRIGUED INSTEAD OF DEFENSIVE WHEN WE ENCOUNTER SOME INFORMATION THAT CONTRADICTS OUR BELIEFS
SO THE QUESTION I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS
WHAT DO YOU MOST YEARN FOR
DO YOU YEARN TO DEFEND YOUR OWN BELIEFS
AS RESEARCHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED IF YOU SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND THE STUDY SHOWS THAT IS NOT EFFECTIVE THEN YOU'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO FIND ALL THE REASONS WHY THE STUDY WAS POORLY DESIGNED
BUT IF IT SHOWS THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WORKS AWESOME IT'S A GOOD STUDY AND VICE VERSA IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SAME THING OUR JUDGMENT IS JUST STRONGLY INFLUENCED UNCONSCIOUSLY BY WHICH SIDE WE WANT TO WIN AND
THIS IS UBIQUITOUS THIS SHAPES HOW WE THINK ABOUT OUR HEALTH RELATIONSHIPS
HOW WE DECIDE HOW TO VOTE WHAT WE CONSIDER FAIR OR ETHICAL
AND WHAT'S MOST SCARY TO ME ABOUT MOTIVATED REASONING OR SOLDIER MINDSET IS HOW UNCONSCIOUS IT IS
WE CAN THINK WE'RE BEING OBJECTIVE AND FAIR MINDED AND STILL WIND UP RUINING THE LIFE OF AN INNOCENT MAN
HOWEVER FORTUNATELY FOR DREYFUS HIS STORY IS NOT
SOLDIER AND THE SCOUT ARE ESSENTIAL
BUT YOU CAN ALSO THINK OF EACH OF THESE ROLES AS A MINDSET
A METAPHOR FOR HOW ALL OF US PROCESS INFORMATION AND IDEAS IN OUR DAILY LIVES
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO ARGUE TODAY IS THAT
HAVING GOOD JUDGMENT AND MAKING ACCURATE PREDICTIONS MAKING GOOD DECISIONS IS MOSTLY ABOUT WHICH MINDSET YOU'RE IN
SO TO ILLUSTRATE THESE MINDSETS IN ACTION I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK TO 19TH CENTURY
IS MUCH TO GAIN AND BENEFIT FROM THIS MASSIVE ANALYSIS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OR BIG DATA BUT THERE ARE ALSO
TO TEST THAT WE DID AN EXPERIMENT ON CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS WE ASKED STUDENTS WHO WERE WALKING BY TO PARTICIPATE IN A
FUTURE WITHOUT SECRETS LOOK LIKE AND SHOULD WE CARE WE MAY LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE WITH SO MUCH WEALTH OF DATA WOULD BE A FUTURE WITH NO MORE BIASES
LOOK AT YOU THROUGH THEIR GOOGLE GLASSES OR ONE DAY THEIR CONTACT LENSES AND USE SEVEN OR EIGHT DATA POINTS ABOUT YOU TO INFER ANYTHING ELSE WHICH MAY BE KNOWN ABOUT YOU WHAT WILL
ANY LONGER EVEN THEMSELVES IN FACIAL COMPOSITES BUT THEY REACT TO THOSE COMPOSITES IN A POSITIVE MANNER SO NEXT TIME YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT AND THERE IS AN AD SUGGESTING YOU TO BUY
COMPUTING WHICH ALLOWS MY PHONE WHICH IS NOT A SUPERCOMPUTER TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET AND DO THERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FACE METRICS IN A FEW SECONDS
WELL WE CONJECTURE THAT THE RESULT OF THIS COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE A RADICAL CHANGE IN OUR VERY NOTIONS OF PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY
TO OUR SUBJECTS INFORMATION ABOUT A POTENTIAL JOB CANDIDATE WE INCLUDED IN THIS
YOU THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE EQUALLY LIKELY TO CALL EITHER CANDIDATE FOR AN INTERVIEW
THAT YOU ARE THE H R DIRECTOR OF A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION AND YOU RECEIVE R SUM S AND YOU DECIDE TO FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CANDIDATES THEREFORE YOU GOOGLE THEIR
SOME REFERENCES TO SOME FUNNY ABSOLUTELY LEGAL BUT PERHAPS SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSING INFORMATION THAT THE SUBJECT HAD POSTED ONLINE
THEY CANNOT CARE ABOUT PRIVACY AND COMING TO THE REALIZATION THAT THESE MANIPULATIONS OCCUR IS ALREADY HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO PROTECT YOURSELF WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU THAT PRIVACY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE BENEFITS OF BIG DATA
THAT SHOT TO A DATABASE OF SOME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF IMAGES WHICH WE HAD DOWNLOADED FROM FACEBOOK PROFILES
BY THE TIME THE SUBJECT REACHED THE LAST PAGE ON THE SURVEY THE PAGE HAD BEEN DYNAMICALLY UPDATED WITH THE 10 BEST MATCHING
IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TRANSPARENCY CAN BE MISDIRECTED YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO AND THEN YOU STILL NUDGE THEM TO DISCLOSE ARBITRARY AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
OF US DO NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THE FIGHT IS GOING ON BUT IT IS WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT AND AT THE RISK OF PLAYING THE SERPENT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE TOOLS FOR THE
PRIVACY INCIDENT INVOLVING ADAM AND EVE
TO ADMIT THAT THIS TALK SO FAR MAY SOUND EXCEEDINGLY GLOOMY
BUT THAT IS NOT MY POINT IN FACT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES THE WAY WE ARE DOING THINGS NOW IS NOT THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DONE AND CERTAINLY NOT THE BEST WAY THEY CAN BE DONE
ORIGINALLY FOR FREEDOM END UP COERCING US HOWEVER IN THE BOOK HE ALSO OFFERS US A WAY OUT OF THAT SOCIETY SIMILAR TO
GROUP DO YOU THINK WAS MORE LIKELY TO JUDGE HARSHLY OUR SUBJECT PARADOXICALLY IT WAS THE GROUP WHO HAD POSTED SIMILAR
AND EVE ARE MATERIALLY CONTENT
THEY'RE HAPPY THEY ARE SATISFIED
HOWEVER THEY ALSO LACK KNOWLEDGE AND SELF AWARENESS
THE MOMENT THEY EAT
THE APTLY NAMED FRUIT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT'S WHEN THEY DISCOVER THEMSELVES
IN A WAY
IS BOTH THE MEANS AND THE PRICE TO PAY
FOR FREEDOM
AGAIN MARKETERS TELL US THAT
BIG DATA AND SOCIAL MEDIA
ARE NOT JUST A PARADISE OF PROFIT FOR THEM BUT A GARDEN OF EDEN FOR THE REST OF
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COMBINE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TOGETHER
INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF FACIAL DATA
IMPROVING FACIAL RECOGNIZING ABILITY BY COMPUTERS BUT ALSO CLOUD COMPUTING WHICH GIVES ANYONE IN THIS THEATER THE KIND OF COMPUTATIONAL POWER WHICH A FEW YEARS AGO WAS ONLY THE DOMAIN OF THREE LETTER AGENCIES AND
VASTLY UNDERESTIMATES {NS} {NS} THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT ORGANIZATIONS CAN GATHER ABOUT YOU AND HOW THEY CAN USE IT TO INFLUENCE YOU IN A WAY THAT YOU WILL NOT EVEN DETECT SO AS AN EXAMPLE THIS IS ANOTHER EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY WE ARE RUNNING NOT YET
THE U S EMPLOYERS WHO ARE IN FACT PART OF OUR EXPERIMENT MEANING WE DID EXACTLY THAT WE CREATED FACEBOOK PROFILES MANIPULATING TRAITS THEN WE STARTED SENDING OUT R SUM S TO COMPANIES IN THE U S AND WE DETECTED WE MONITORED
ARE HERE THE AWARENESS OF WHAT IS GOING ON AND IN YOUR HANDS JUST A FEW
OF BIG DATA WHILE PROTECTING PRIVACY OF COURSE THESE TECHNOLOGIES IMPLY A SHIFTING OF COST AND REVENUES BETWEEN DATA HOLDERS AND DATA SUBJECTS WHICH IS WHY PERHAPS YOU DON'T HEAR MORE ABOUT THEM
THAT BE ALWAYS THE CASE IN A MOVIE WHICH CAME OUT FEW YEARS AGO MINORITY REPORT A FAMOUS SCENE HAD TOM
THE QUESTION BECOMES CAN YOU START FROM A FACE AND USING FACIAL RECOGNITION FIND A NAME AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT NAME AND THAT
IN THE YEAR 2000 ABOUT 100 BILLION PHOTOS WERE SHOT WORLDWIDE BUT ONLY A MINUSCULE PROPORTION OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY UPLOADED ONLINE IN 2010 ONLY ON FACEBOOK IN A SINGLE MONTH 2 5 BILLION PHOTOS WERE UPLOADED MOST OF THEM IDENTIFIED
AND PERHAPS BUY PRODUCTS ON OUR BEHALF BEFORE WE EVEN KNOW WE NEED THEM
NOW THERE WAS ONE ENGLISH AUTHOR
WHO ANTICIPATED THIS KIND OF FUTURE WHERE WE WOULD TRADE AWAY OUR AUTONOMY AND FREEDOM
FOR COMFORT
EVEN MORE SO THAN GEORGE ORWELL THE AUTHOR IS OF
AND HER NAILS WERE THIS REALLY BRIGHT PINK COLOR AND I NOTICED HOW LOUD THE CRICKETS SOUNDED THAT
BEFORE THE WORK DAY BEGINS AND RIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED
AND WHEN THEY'RE SAID OUT LOUD LIKE THAT DO ANY OF THOSE REALLY SOUND LIKE SUCH BIG THINGS
SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO ASK SOMETHING OF YOU AUDIENCE
THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE SITTING HERE PROBABLY SOME PASSING THOUGHT ALREADY STRESSED OR AT LEAST THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN YOUR DAY AFTER THIS CONFERENCE
I WANT YOU TO TRY YOUR VERY BEST TO PUT THAT ASIDE FOR JUST A MOMENT
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH
AND REALIZE THAT THE WORLD IS NOT SPINNING OUT OF YOUR CONTROL
APPRECIATE WHERE YOU ARE IN THIS MOMENT
SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT HOW DO WE FIGHT AGAINST IT
WELL FOR ME IT COMES THROUGH REALIZING THAT IT'S OK THAT I CAN'T DO AS MUCH AS I USED TO
THAT WHAT I CAN DO IS ENOUGH
THAT
I NEED TO MAKE SURE AT LEAST MOST NIGHTS OF THE WEEK I GET ENOUGH SLEEP BECAUSE THE SECOND I TRY TO PULL AN ALL NIGHTER IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS MOSQUITO BUZZING AROUND INSIDE MY HEAD
MENSTRUATE ONCE A YEAR AND NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME IT HAD BEEN GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE FROM ABOUT THE
IT WAS NAMED AFTER THE GENTLEMAN WHO CATEGORIZED THIS GROUPING OF SYMPTOMS I SAID OH MY GOD I FIT THIS DESCRIPTION TO A TEE SO
TO AFFECT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE SO EXCITING AND
THAT'S WHEN I FELL IN LOVE I SAID OH MY GOD
HERE WE ARE WE ARE WALKING AROUND WITH THESE BLUEPRINTS IN OUR BODIES
THAT TELL US HOW TO LIVE AND WORK IN A WAY THAT'S
IN THE FLOW OF OUR BODIES
AND IF WE CAN BECOME FLUENT IN THE LANGUAGE
OF OUR BIOCHEMISTRY
AND OUR PHYSIOLOGY
THIS GROUPING OF GLANDS AND ORGANS THAT I LIKE TO
MYSELF WITH ALL SORTS OF HEALERS AND I WAS DOING ALL SORTS OF FUN EXPERIMENTS I HAD TURNED
PARTS DO AND HOW TO EAT TO SUPPORT THEM SO THEY CAN FUNCTION OPTIMALLY FOR YOU THE
TRAINED HOPKINS MIND AND GO FIGURE THIS OUT SO THAT'S WHAT I
IS A CHANGE AGENT AND THEN THAT
THIS IS THE WEEK DETAIL ORIENTED TASKS ARE VERY EASY TO DO TRY NOT TO PLAN THEM IN THE OTHER TWO WEEKS
IN THE FOURTH PHASE THE MENSTRUAL PHASE THIS IS THE TIME OF THE MONTH WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE MOST ACTIVE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT HEMISPHERES OF THE BRAIN
SO AMAZING SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING INTO
COURSE CORRECT EVALUATE YOUR LIFE
IN THE PAST 30 DAYS HOW YOU DID THIS MONTH THIS WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO IT YOU'RE MOST ABLE TO RECEIVE THOSE
GUT FEELING BODY MESSAGES
YOU CAN BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION
THEN WE CAN REALLY STEP INTO OUR ROLES AS LEADERS AS WOMEN
SO
WOMEN GIVE BIRTH
THROUGH THE BODY
THE BIGGEST ACT OF OUR GENERATION OF WOMEN IS GOING TO BE TO BE IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BODY TO NOT LEAVE IT OUT
AND I REALLY WANT TO SEE
THEIR BODIES AS A TOOL SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE THREE THINGS THAT WE TEACH EVERYBODY THE FIRST IS YOU HAVE TO FALL IN LOVE YOU HAVE TO LEARN
IN ONE OF THE OBSTETRICS JOURNALS AND I SAW THIS SMALL STUDY ON A DISORDER CALLED STEIN
SO MUCH CARROT JUICE AT ONE POINT MY GIRLFRIEND AT THAT TIME SHE'S STILL MY BEST FRIEND SHE GRABBED ME AND SHE SAID YOU'VE TURNED ORANGE IT'S TIME TO STOP THIS EXPERIMENT AND I HAVE TO
MONTHLY NOW AND WE ARE CLOSE FRIENDS I JUST FIND THAT WHOLE STORY SO FASCINATING ANOTHER WOMAN CAME IN ON BIRTH CONTROL ON PROZAC IN
WITH THEIR BODIES END UP BECOMING THE FULLEST EXPRESSION OF THEMSELVES AND LIVING AS LEADERS AND CHANGE AGENTS IN THEIR LIVES AND COMMUNITIES
THEIR HEALTH ISSUES WOULD RESOLVE THEMSELVES MIRACULOUS THINGS FOR ME AS A SCIENTIST LIKE A WOMAN WITHOUT A PERIOD FOR 17 YEARS SHE'D HAVE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR ONCE A YEAR TO BE INDUCED WITH PROGESTERONE TO HAVE A BLEED SHE
NONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS MADE ANY CHANGE IN MY SYMPTOMS AT ALL AND THEN ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHAT WAS COMING TO THE FOREFRONT IN NUTRITIONAL SCIENCE WAS THIS IDEA OF NUTRITIONAL GENOMICS THAT YOU COULD
APPLIED THE PROTOCOL TO HER BODY AND EFFORTLESSLY THIS IS THE PART THAT I KIND OF GET EXCITED ABOUT EFFORTLESSLY HER BODY RESTORED ITSELF REMEMBER THAT GAME CONNECT FOUR I LOVE THAT
ALONG THE WAY SO DON'T WORRY AND I REMEMBER SITTING IN THAT CHAIR AND IT WASN'T OUT OF ANGER OR A
SENSITIVE HYPOTHALAMUS WORKS WITH THIS THING CALLED NEGATIVE BIO FEEDBACK SO ANY TIME THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS THE TEMPERATURE CHANGES OUTSIDE HYPOTHALAMUS PICKS THAT UP PITUITARY GLAND SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE THYROID
DATE OR HAVE AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH YOUR PARTNER OR TELL YOUR MOTHER SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT HER TO SAY YES TO YOU'RE JUST A MAGNET AT THAT TIME IN A LUTEAL
IN FACT YOU WERE RIGHT
AND BEING A NOW WHAT SOLUTION KIND OF GIRL I SAID SO NOW WHAT WHAT DO WE DO NOW I KNOW WHAT IT IS FINALLY NOW WHAT SHE SAID WELL
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET SITTING IN THAT CHAIR IN HER OFFICE
SHE SAID
YOU HAVE A FUTURE LAID OUT AHEAD OF YOU OF OBESITY DIABETES INFERTILITY HEART DISEASE AND CANCER
LEARN ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT REAL PHYSICAL STRUCTURES IN OUR BODIES THAT GIVE US
LITERALLY FELL OFF MY CHAIR WHEN I HEARD HER SAY THAT BECAUSE ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH WE AS WOMEN GET ON THIS HAMSTER WHEELS OF SELF IMPROVEMENT AND
FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET INTO
DREAM BIG ALL OF THAT IN THE OVULATORY PHASE WHICH
AGO WAS A STUDENT AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND
I WAS READY TO BEGIN MY LIFE I WAS PLANNING TO BECOME OB GYN
AND MY BODY
ALL OF A SUDDEN
WENT INTO TOTAL
HORMONAL COLLAPSE AND AS A RESULT SO DID MY LIFE TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL I COULDN'T GET UP COULDN'T GO TO SLEEP COULDN'T HAVE ANY ENERGY IT WAS
A NON STOP NIGHTMARE TO WAKE UP NOT RECOGNIZING YOURSELF AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO LIVE IN THE BODY THAT YOU HAD
I
BRAIN HEART MUSCLE TISSUE HORMONES FASCINATING AND THEY'RE
TUBE VERY EXCITING TIME {LG} NEUROCHEMICALLY SPEAKING
AGO AND STARTED TREATING OTHER WOMEN WITH SIMILAR CONDITIONS MENSTRUAL ISSUES FERTILITY ISSUES
TO HOW TO ORGANIZE OUR LIVES I MEAN IF YOU ACTUALLY ADHERE TO THE MAP YOU LEARN EXACTLY
DO OR PUSH OR STRUGGLE IT'S JUST THERE FOR YOU
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE ENVIRONMENT IS A LITTLE BIT MASTERING US RIGHT NOW WOMAN'S BODIES ARE IN HORMONAL BREAKDOWN IN EPIDEMIC
PROPORTIONS I
YOUR HORMONAL RATIOS YOU HAVE FOUR OF THEM
IN ONE MONTH CYCLE AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ONLY EVER REFERENCE THAT IN A VERY BASIC WAY
I WAS AT THE LIBRARY OF COURSE SCIENCE NERD SEXY SCIENTIST
THE ECOLOGY OF HER ENTIRE LIFE WITH THIS IDEA OF TRANSFORMATION
ANOTHER WOMAN HAD TWO BUSINESSES HAD ALL SORT OF THINGS GOING ON IN HER LIFE
IT IN THE OVULATORY PHASE WE HAVE THE BEST COMMUNICATION SKILLS
AND THE MOST ENERGY THAT WE WILL HAVE ALL THE MONTH
THIS IS DEFINITELY A TIME TO HAVE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS
WOULDN'T IT BE GENIUS IF YOU COULD PLAN TO ASK
FOR A RAISE
YOUR LADY PARTS TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE AND CHANGE THE WORLD I'M ALISA VITTI IT'S BEEN AN HONOR
A THING YOU WERE MERELY ENJOYING THE WEATHER LOVE THAT GENIUS
ORGANS ARE ON THE RISE IN MEN AND WOMEN
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR BODY HAS WHAT IT NEEDS TO FUNCTION
I USED TO PLAY THAT ALL THE TIME WITH MY BROTHER SO YOU KNOW HER WHOLE LIFE JUST STARTED LINING UP SHE EFFORTLESSLY LET GO OF THESE CLIENTS IN NEW YORK ALLOWED ONE
THERE WAS NO FIGHT IT WAS JUST ON A CELLULAR LEVEL MY WHOLE BEING SAID NO
AND I WAS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY MORE CURIOUS AND FRUSTRATED AND IN ONE OF MY
ARE A COUPLE OF OTHERS
SO I WANT YOU TO START TO THINK ABOUT
WHERE YOU ARE
IN THAT
CYCLE
AND HERE ARE THE FOUR PHASES
FIRST YOU HAVE THE FOLLICULAR PHASE FASCINATING PHASE AND NEUROCHEMICALLY THESE HORMONAL RATIOS CHANGE YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY SO YOU ARE A DIFFERENT PERSON WEEK OVER WEEK WITHIN A MONTH YEAH
IN A VERY CLEVER WAY
THEY'RE MADE OUT OF A THING CALLED A SWELLABLE MATERIAL
IT'S A SPECIAL KIND OF MATERIAL THAT WHEN YOU ADD WATER IT WILL SWELL UP ENORMOUSLY MAYBE A THOUSAND TIMES IN VOLUME
AND THIS IS A VERY USEFUL INDUSTRIAL KIND OF POLYMER BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN MY GROUP AT MIT IS TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE BRAIN
CHEMICAL EXCHANGES THAT ALLOW NEURONS TO WORK TOGETHER TO GENERATE THINGS LIKE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND SO
YOU THINK ABOUT THE ORIGINAL MOON SHOT WHERE THEY ACTUALLY LANDED ON THE MOON IT WAS BASED ON SOLID SCIENCE WE UNDERSTOOD GRAVITY WE UNDERSTOOD AERODYNAMICS WE KNEW HOW TO BUILD ROCKETS THE SCIENCE RISK WAS UNDER
FOR NEUROSCIENCE MICROSCOPES ARE ACTUALLY HOW NEURONS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE FIRST PLACE ABOUT 130 YEARS AGO BUT LIGHT IS FUNDAMENTALLY LIMITED YOU CAN'T SEE INDIVIDUAL MOLECULES WITH A REGULAR OLD MICROSCOPE YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THESE TINY
THE CHANGES IN THE WIRING OF THESE NETWORKS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO OUR ABILITY TO BE CONSCIOUS AND POWERFUL
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO MAP THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE IN WIDE VARIETY OF DISEASES CAN WE ACTUALLY PINPOINT THE MOLECULAR CHANGES IN A TUMOR SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GO AFTER IT IN A SMART WAY AND DELIVER DRUGS THAT MIGHT WIPE OUT EXACTLY THE CELLS THAT WE WANT TO
A CUBIC MILLIMETER OF YOUR BRAIN THERE ARE ABOUT 100000 OF THESE NEURONS AND MAYBE A BILLION OF THOSE CONNECTIONS
SO IF WE WANT TO MAKE OUR ABILITY TO SEE THE BRAIN MORE POWERFUL TO GET DOWN TO THE GROUND TRUTH STRUCTURE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE EVEN BETTER
THE MYSTERY THEN HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MAKE THESE POLYMER CHAINS INSIDE THE BRAIN SO WE CAN MOVE ALL THE BIOMOLECULES
YOU KNOW MY WIFE AND I HAVE TWO YOUNG KIDS AND ONE OF MY HOPES AS A BIOENGINEER IS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR THEM THAN IT CURRENTLY IS FOR US
POLYMERS ARE REALLY DENSE THEY'RE SEPARATED BY DISTANCES THAT ARE AROUND THE SIZE OF A BIOMOLECULE THIS IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE WE COULD POTENTIALLY MOVE EVERYTHING APART IN THE
DECIDED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF WE COULD TAKE POLYMERS LIKE THE STUFF IN THE BABY DIAPER AND INSTALL IT PHYSICALLY WITHIN THE BRAIN
IF WE COULD DO IT JUST RIGHT AND YOU ADD WATER YOU CAN POTENTIALLY BLOW THE BRAIN UP TO WHERE YOU COULD DISTINGUISH THOSE TINY BIOMOLECULES FROM EACH OTHER YOU WOULD SEE THOSE CONNECTIONS AND GET MAPS OF THE
ALL RIGHT THE MOMENT OF TRUTH WE HAVE TO TREAT THIS SPECIMEN WITH A CHEMICAL TO KIND OF LOOSEN UP ALL THE MOLECULES FROM EACH
MAYBE WE COULD PINPOINT THE EXACT SET OF MOLECULAR CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN A BRAIN DISORDER AND ONCE WE KNOW HOW THOSE MOLECULES HAVE CHANGED WHETHER THEY'VE INCREASED IN NUMBER OR CHANGED IN PATTERN WE COULD USE THOSE AS TARGETS FOR NEW DRUGS FOR NEW WAYS OF DELIVERING ENERGY INTO THE
WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS WE'RE GOING TO NEED NEW TECHNOLOGIES
BUT IF WE COULD GET SUCH MAPS IF WE COULD LOOK AT THE ORGANIZATION OF MOLECULES AND NEURONS AND NEURONS AND NETWORKS
MAYBE WE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN CONDUCTS INFORMATION FROM SENSORY REGIONS MIXES IT WITH EMOTION AND FEELING AND GENERATES OUR DECISIONS AND
ARGUE THAT WITH TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THE KINDS I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY MAYBE WE CAN ACTUALLY DERIVE THOSE WE CAN MAP THE PATTERNS THAT OCCUR IN LIVING SYSTEMS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO OVERCOME THE DISEASES THAT PLAGUE
DIAPERS HAVE INTERESTING PROPERTIES THEY CAN SWELL ENORMOUSLY WHEN YOU ADD WATER TO THEM AN EXPERIMENT DONE BY MILLIONS OF KIDS EVERY DAY
BABY DIAPER POLYMER IF YOU COULD ZOOM IN IT MIGHT LOOK SOMETHING LIKE WHAT YOU SEE ON THE
FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEW TREATMENTS MUCH LESS CURES AND FOR WHICH VERY OFTEN WE DON'T KNOW THE CAUSE OR THE ORIGINS AND WHAT'S REALLY CAUSING THEM TO OCCUR
BIOMEDICINE THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT EXPANSION MIGHT HELP WITH THIS IS AN ACTUAL BIOPSY FROM A
HOPE IS IF WE CAN TURN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE FROM THESE HIGH RISK ENDEAVORS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY CHANCE AND
AND OF COURSE WE CAN PINPOINT HOPEFULLY THE ACTUAL PROBLEMS IN THE BRAIN AT A MOLECULAR LEVEL
WHAT IF WE COULD ACTUALLY LOOK INTO CELLS IN THE BRAIN AND FIGURE OUT WOW HERE THE 17 MOLECULES THAT HAVE ALTERED IN THIS BRAIN TISSUE THAT HAS BEEN UNDERGOING EPILEPSY OR CHANGING IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE OR OTHERWISE BEING ALTERED
WE'VE ALL SEEN BRAIN SCANS TAKEN USING MRI MACHINES THESE OF COURSE HAVE THE GREAT POWER THAT THEY ARE NONINVASIVE THEY CAN BE USED ON LIVING HUMAN SUBJECTS BUT ALSO THEY'RE SPATIALLY
IF WE COULD GET THAT MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE BRAIN IS ORGANIZED TO YIELD THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS AND ACTIONS AND SENSATIONS MAYBE WE COULD TRY TO PINPOINT THE EXACT CHANGES IN THE BRAIN THAT RESULT IN DISEASES DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S AND EPILEPSY AND
DO IS TO FILL THE SURVIVAL VOID A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR A LONG TIME
IT GOES
ALL OF THE FALSE FIXES WE ARE USED TO IN LIFE I LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THAT WINE BOTTLE AND THINK ABOUT THAT BRAND NEW FACEBOOK
THAT HAS AN AMAZING FOLLOWING OF A THOUSAND WOMEN
IT'S CALLED I NEED A GLASS OF WINE OR I'M GOING TO SELL MY CHILDREN
LOOK AT THE NEXT PART OF THE BRAIN THAT GETS HAMMERED WITH ALL OF THIS AS WE ARE DESCRIBING THIS PROBLEM WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PREFRONTAL
WHAT DO THEY SPEND IT ON BOOZE WOMEN SHOES AND CAREGIVING HELPING OURSELVES AND EVERYONE WHO COMES WITHIN HUNDRED FEET OF US EVEN IF WE DON'T KNOW THEM
NOW LISTEN UP MEN LEFT HEMISPHERE TASK ORIENTED HONEY YOU'RE EITHER ON OR OFF
BRINGS BACK GREAT MEMORIES AND THEN MORE AND MORE AND MORE WHAT'S GOING ON
RIGHT
AND THE GREENS YOU DIDN'T KNOW HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A METHYL DONOR JUST A LITTLE SIDE CHAIN IT'D PICK THEM UP EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU'D HAVE GREENS AND GOOD WHOLE FOODS AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU DO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU MEDITATE THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING YOU'RE CHANGING GENE EXPRESSION
JUST SHOWING YOU THAT WHEN YOU GO EPIGENETIC WHEN YOU FILL THE VOID WITH HEALTHY FIXES EVERYTHING IS LOOKING UP {LG}
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM
AND
PRESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT OF A BRAND NEW SOLUTION BASED UPON HOT NEW SCIENCE
THAT MOST OF YOU MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE
A TWIST
ON SURVIVAL
WE'RE CAREGIVING THEM WE'RE ETERNAL CAREGIVERS
TO OUR OWN DETRIMENT
KEEP THAT CONTEXT IN MIND AS WE PUSH FORWARD I TOLD YOU THAT YOU MOST PROBABLY HAVE ADDICTIVE LIKE BEHAVIORS AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE FILLING THAT VOID WITH THIS I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER SEEN BEFORE
WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO
LIKE SUGARY FATTY SALTY FOODS BUT THEY DO A NUMBER ON YOUR BRAIN YOU SEE IT'S NOT A BLACK BOX ANYMORE WE CAN PEER IN THERE WITH SCANS WHAT WE SEE IS THE ACTUAL DAMAGE
IMPATIENCE AND IRRITABILITY GUESS WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING YOU CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE IT GETS HAMMERED
IS REAL WE ACTUALLY HAVE ADDICTIVE LIKE HABITS AROUND FOODS SURPRISINGLY IT'S NOT KALE THIS IS USUALLY HYPER
ORANGE THE RED ORANGE OF THE REWARD CENTER THE REWARD CENTER LIGHTS
DID YOU KNOW THAT SUGAR IS MORE ADDICTIVE THAN COCAINE YES REFINED SUGAR LATELY THERE WAS A
IT FEELS STARING AT SCREENS
WHAT ABOUT GETTING TO WORK AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND LEAVING AT MIDNIGHT ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT
WHAT HAPPENED TO EATING
AND WHAT DO YOU EAT
AND DO YOU SLEEP AT ALL WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THAT THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL FALSE FIXES
OH SURE THEY FIX SORT OF FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THEY BOOMERANG RIGHT BACK IN YOUR FACE
AS WE
ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY
YOU SIT FOR TOO LONG YOU INCREASE YOUR RISK FOR HEART DISEASE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY METABOLICALLY YOU
MADE IT FAT FLOPPY YELLOW BECAUSE WAS A COLOR OF THE FUR THING LINKED IN WITH THE AGOUTI GENE IT DIED OF EVERY DISEASE VERY EARLY WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO WAS JUST SOMETHING FUN WE FED IT GREENS THAT'S
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE LOOK AT EVERYTHING ELSE WE DO
DON'T LOOK FOR GREENS YOU'RE COOL BECAUSE GREENS ARE SO LAST YEAR INSTEAD WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SAY I'M
AHEAD AND FED THE MICE THIS AND THEN THEY HAD BABIES AND THE BABIES WERE BORN LEAN
GUESS WHAT HAPPENS WHAT WE NOTICE IN THAT SCAN IS THAT
THE ABILITY OF THE BRAIN TO BE ABLE TO MUSTER UP ALL OF THE WONDERFUL SKILLS THAT YOU SEE IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX WHICH ARE ORGANIZING STRATEGIZING STAYING VIGILANT BEING MINDFUL
REIGNING
WHAT WE HAVE IS A BRAND NEW SCIENCE THAT SAYS EVERY SINGLE THOUGHT YOU HAVE EVERY SINGLE MOUTHFUL OF WHATEVER YOU'RE EATING AND EVERY SINGLE STEP YOU TAKE
CHANGES GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES THE WAY THE WHOLE BODY IS TALKING TO ITSELF AND CHANGES YOUR DESTINY THAT'S
THE DOCTOR AND I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU {LG} NO I'M NOT WHAT
NEED TO KNOW NOW THAT WE COULD TAKE THIS ON TO GENERATION AFTER GENERATION WE FEEL SO GOOD WHEN WE PUT MIND MOUTH AND MUSCLE TOGETHER WHEN WE CHANGE GENE EXPRESSION WHEN WE GO EPIGENETIC
BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER PIECE OF THIS TOO GOD YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD TOO I MET THIS HAPPY
IMPAIRS THIS ENTIRE PART OF THE BRAIN AT THE SAME TIME SLEEP DOES WHAT ABOUT ZZZ'S ZZZ'S PLEASE
PEOPLE FEELING VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THEY GOT JUST FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP REALLY DO YOU WANT A BELLY THAT EXTENDS FROM HERE TO THE NEXT STATE THAT'S GREAT WAY TO DO IT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SLEEP NONE OF GROWTH HORMONE ON BOARD WHEN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT TIME WHEN YOU'RE IMPAIRED THIS WAY YOU HAVE TOO MUCH STRESS HORMONE BIG BELLY
YOU WERE STUCK WITH YOUR DNA WHATEVER YOU'RE BORN WITH HONEY THAT WAS YOUR DESTINY THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS ANYMORE
WHEN DOPAMINE THAT FANTASTIC LUSTFUL PLEASURE NEUROTRANSMITTER LINKS UP WITH DOPAMINE RECEPTORS THAT'S WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE LOOK AT THE OTHER BRAINS IT COULD BE
HALF DEAD THIS IS WHAT SHE ENDED UP DOING WHAT SHE ENDED UP DOING WAS
AROUND SHE FOUGHT HER FOOD ADDICTION SHE FOUGHT HER EVERY SINGLE ADDICTIVE PRACTICE SHE HAD SHE SLUGGED IT OUT IT TOOK HER 2 3 YEARS GUESS WHAT SHE ENDED UP DOING ENDING UP IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS FOR HOLDING UP THE LONGEST PLANK THAT'S RIGHT
ARE ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING WITH HAPPINESS AND AT THE SAME TIME
THE BELLY THAT'S WHAT HIS BELLY LOOKS LIKE IF I CUT HIM LIKE SALAMI AND THAT'S A CAT SCAN
US THAT A PINT OF ICE CREAM HAS FOUR SERVINGS IN IT NO NO NO LAW AMP ORDER
WAS ONE PARTICULAR GENE WE WANTED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE OREO CAUSED THE SAME CHANGES AS MORPHINE AND COCAINE GUESS WHAT HAPPENED
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
THE SAME THING AND EVEN WORSE DO YOU KNOW THAT RATS BAGGED THE MORPHINE AND THE COCAINE AND WENT RIGHT FOR THE FILLING
JUST LIKE YOU AND I HAVE DONE FOR YEARS SORT OF METAPHOR ISN'T IT THEY LITERALLY WE WATCHED THEM WE HAVE VIDEOS OF THIS RIPPING THE COOKIE APART AND GOING FOR THE
CENTER IS IT REVERSIBLE ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S A KEEN GRASP OF THE OBVIOUS LET
LET'S SEE THE BIRTH OF EPIGENETICS VERY SIMPLE WE TOOK A MOUSE THAT WAS BASICALLY CONDEMNED TO DEATH IT HAD THE AGOUTI GENE DEEP INSIDE IT AND THIS AGOUTI
YOU CAN'T MOVE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR ACTUALLY I'M A PHYSICIAN THIS IS KILLING ME I WANT EVERYONE TO STAND UP EVERYONE STAND UP
LEST I FORGET AS I WRAP THIS UP WE NEED
AND YOU'RE OUT END OF STORY NOT SO GOOD WHAT ELSE HAMMERS THIS STRESS THERE IS A REASON WHY STRESSED' SPELLED BACKWARDS IS
ON OREOS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT ACTUALLY I DID A NICE LITTLE PIECE ON THIS AND IT WAS FABULOUS
WHAT IT WAS THEY TOOK RATS AND THEY INJECTED THEM WITH MORPHINE AND
THEY INJECTED THEM WITH COCAINE AND
THEN THEY OFFERED THEM AN OREO
YOU'LL JUST NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED
WHAT WE WERE
MOUTH AND MUSCLE I WANT TO GO DEEP AND WANT TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THESE FALSE FIXES THAT YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF AT ALL WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE MIND AH THE MIND
FIXES
AND THAT IS
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT IT'S NOT APPLES AND KALE
WHEN THINGS GET LITTLE TOUGH OUT THERE IT'S USUALLY THAT
NATIONAL M NAGE TROIS' ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN LATE AT NIGHT
LIFE OF FALSE FIXES HERE'S THE SOLUTION HOW MANY OF YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT EPIGENETICS EPIGENETICS IS
MY JOURNEY 30 YEARS AGO AND I WORKED IN MINES AND I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS A WORLD UNSEEN AND I WANTED THROUGH COLOR AND LARGE FORMAT CAMERAS AND VERY LARGE PRINTS TO MAKE A BODY OF WORK THAT SOMEHOW BECAME
THESE BIRDS ARE FAR FROM ORDINARY ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY THE GOOSE SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED IS THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DECLINE IN THE POPULATION THIS 21ST CENTURY
FOR MOST PEOPLE THE CANADA GOOSE IS AT BEST ORDINARY AND AT WORST A PEST THAT RUINS THE LAWNS OF PUBLIC PLACES
THE PEST PART IS TRUE
THEY CAN BE ANNOYING
THEY'RE LOUD AND THEY BUG PEOPLE BY ASKING FOR FOOD
WHICH BY THE WAY IT'S OUR FAULT BECAUSE WE STARTED FEEDING THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE
WHAT I FOUND FASCINATING IS THAT THE CANADA GOOSE MATES FOR LIFE AND THEY KNOW WHERE TO MIGRATE WE
HAVE TO CHANGE FOR THE CANADA GOOSE BECAUSE SOME AREAS HAVE LITTLE FOOD SUPPLIES FOR THEM
THE GEESE CAN STRUGGLE TO FIND WAYS TO LIVE IN THE CITY
BUT THEY CAN LIVE ALMOST 24 YEARS IN THE WILD
IF PROVIDED WITH A CLEAN AND HEALTHY HABITAT
IN THE CITY NOT ONLY THE CANADA GOOSE
TO LOSE WEIGHT SO SORRY THIS IS WHAT YOU GOTTA WORK WITH
BEAUTIFUL SHE IS ALMOST EVERY SINGLE WOMAN APOLOGIZES AND DOES NOT FEEL THAT SHE MEASURES UP TO THIS NEW STANDARD OF BEAUTY AND I'M SURE THAT MAYBE SOME OF YOU
THERE IS A VERY REAL TRANSFORMATION THAT HAPPENS IN THIS CHAIR
NEED TO HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY AND THE OTHER WOMEN IN THIS VERY
IN THIS AUDIENCE AND TO YOU LADIES I SAY GO AHEAD AND TAKE A BATHROOM BREAK YOU CAN BE BACK IN LIKE 5 MINUTES OR SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU DON'T
AND ACTUALLY SMILE AT HERSELF EVEN IF IT'S
HAVE YOUR MOTHER'S EYES AND YOU WOULD NEVER THINK FOR A SECOND THAT THIS WOMAN WHO GAVE YOU LIFE AND WISDOM WAS NOT MEASURING UP OKAY STOP
AND THIS IS WHAT I HEAR EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY DAY OF MY LIFE
I AM A MAKEUP ARTIST AND THESE ARE REAL WORDS FROM REAL WOMEN
I'M ALSO AN ACTRESS BUT
FOR MY PAST 7 YEARS OF DOING MAKEUP I HAVE DISCOVERED WITHIN THE FIRST 3 SECONDS OF SITTING IN MY CHAIR ALMOST EVERY SINGLE WOMAN APOLOGIZES TO ME FOR THE WAY SHE LOOKS
GROUP ARE THE WOMEN WHO ARE AWARE OF THEIR OWN MORTALITY AND I'LL GET BACK TO THEM IN A LITTLE BIT
ELSE IT PLEASES OUR PRIMORDIAL SENSES AND I AS A MAKEUP ARTIST AM VERY ADEPT WITH THE SKILLS AND
BECAUSE ALL I SEE IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND I
A WOMAN FEEL MORE ATTRACTIVE AND THUS MORE CONFIDENT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THOSE BIOLOGICAL CUES OF
OF DIFFERENT REASONS LOT OF TIMES SHE JUST FEELS DOWN ABOUT THE WAY SHE LOOKS AND HER FRIEND WILL TELL HER OH YOU HAVE TO GO SEE EVA SHE'S AMAZING SHE'S GREAT SHE'LL TEACH YOU MAKEUP TRICKS IT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST I THINK
WHICH IS WHY I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS TREADING IN THE DEEP END OF A SHALLOW PROFESSION
BECAUSE
I USE MAKEUP AS MY TOOL TO HELP HER BELIEVE IT
MAKEUP IS MY
THESE ARE THE MOVERS THE SHAKERS THEY'RE THE POWERHOUSES THEY COULD BE CEO'S OR STAY AT HOME MOMS
NO DON'T WORRY MY NOSE IS LIKE A MUPPET'S FIST JUST LIKE
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SCARY IT'S THE REASON WHY I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO FINISH THIS TED TALK TO BEGIN WITH
WELL IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT I WAS ACTUALLY THE MAKEUP ARTIST FOR TEDX LAST YEAR AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN THESE INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE WOMEN SAT IN MY CHAIR THEY
THAT IF LINING MY EYES BRINGS SYMMETRY TO MY FACE AND TO MY MIND THEN I GUESS I'LL DO IT
AND IF ADDING A TOUCH OF COLOR TO MY LIPS ALLOWS ME TO BRING JOY AND COLOR TO MY SPEECH THEN WHY THE HECK NOT
BUT SO IS YOUR SPIRIT BECAUSE OF IT AND YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE NOTES OF A LUSH JAMMY PRIMITIVO WINE BETTER THAN MOST BECAUSE OF IT PROBABLY
MY MOTHER IN LAW SAYS THAT I HAVE A ROUND FACE AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE A ROUND FAT FACE PRETTY
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THAT I DON'T ACCEPT IT SO IN DESPERATE NEED FOR A SOLUTION
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO TOUCH MY FACE
LOOK AT THIS BREAKOUT I LOOK DISGUSTING
I'M SORRY
BUT
I AM NOT A PRETTY WOMAN
NO THANK YOU BUT NO
I LOOK LIKE CRAP
THE DOCTOR
OH GOD I'M SORRY I HAVE A VERY TOUGH FACE I HATE THAT I AM ACTUALLY DEPENDENT ON EYELINER TO EVEN WALK OUT MY FRONT DOOR
IS THIS WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR ME TO APPRECIATE WHAT I HAVE
IS THE VERY LEAST OF WHAT I DO BUT I'M NOT SAYING DENYING THAT MAKEUP DOES NOT PLAY A VERY REAL PART
A GROUP OF INTELLECTUALS THEN I WILL DO IT AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL BEAUTIFUL AND I WILL SIT IN MY CHAIR AND I WILL LISTEN
PORN AND FASHION AND PHOTOSHOP ALL MIXED UP IN ONE YEAH GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
AND
IT'S NOT GOING AWAY
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WHAT AM I GOING TO
RIGHT AH IT'S MY BIRTHDAY I'M 96 YEARS OLD AND I'M ON BORROWED TIME NOW HONEY
AND I SEE THESE WRINKLES AND I FEEL OLD AND UGLY
OUT OF MY CHAIR WITH THIS NEW SKIP IN HER STEP I SEE HER
BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU I THINK EVERY
I THOUGHT
WHAT CAN I DO
SO
I THOUGHT WELL WHY DON'T I DO WHAT OTHER WOMEN DO THEY DO IT AND IT WORKS FOR THEM EVEN IF IT'S TEMPORARY WHY DON'T I TRY IT
WHY DON'T I SIT IN EVA'S CHAIR
WHAT WOULD EVA SAY TO ME IF I APOLOGIZED TO EVA
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CHEESY I KNOW
ERH SO NO WORRIES TRYING TO COVER IT UP I HAVE SAID THOSE EXACT WORDS IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S MAKEUP CHAIR I TOO DO
NOW YOU WOULD THINK BECAUSE THIS IS MY JOB AND I DO THIS
AND EXPRESS TO ME WHAT HER CONCERNS ARE SO I CAN ADDRESS THEM AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT WORKS ALMOST
THEY DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR IT THEY LIVE IN THE MOMENT AND THEY LET THEMSELVES HAVE THAT PLEASURE OF LIVING IN THE MOMENT AND IN THE NOW AND I AM IN
I LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ALL I SEE IS A TIRED MOM
MASTECTOMY AND SIX ROUNDS OF CHEMO SO I'M JUST SO {NS} {NS} AND I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE MY NEW WIG
ASK THE CAT TO THROW THE BALL UP AGAINST THE WALL AND I ASK THE AUDIENCE THAT'S YOU TO MAKE A PREDICTION OF WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT OUT LOUD YOU CAN KEEP IT TO YOURSELF AND WHEN THAT CAT THROWS THE BALL YOU ARE GOING TO THINK THE
BALL DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO PENETRATE THE WALL AND
PERHAPS IT IS THE CASE THAT LIFE COULD NOT HAVE STARTED OR
SEE IT HAS PHYSICAL SHAPE BUT WHEN YOU DON'T LOOK IT BEHAVES LIKE A WAVE AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT BEHAVES LIKE A
AND LO AND BEHOLD EVERY SINGLE TIME THE CAT SEES JUST THAT THE BALL EITHER GOES DOWN THE RIGHT THE BALL EITHER GOES DOWN THE LEFT
WITH EACH OTHER THAT THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT EMERGES
WITH UNCERTAINTY IN FUTURE EVENTS WE ARE NOT USED TO DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY
EACH OTHER AND THE TROUBLE IS IF YOU ARE GOVERNED BY PHYSICS
SO WHAT TOOK PLACE WE CALL THEM ON THE PHONE A PHONE RINGS IN
ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO CONSTRUCT THE HISTORY AND THAT IS WHY
BY CHOICE I TRULY WOULD LIKE TO BE MORE THAN A
AND NEXT ON THE MENU I'M GOING TO SWITCH PARADOXES TO SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND THAT'S CALLED QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY AND
IF NOT FOR AT THE MICRO SCALE THINGS TO BE GOVERNED BY QUANTUM PHYSICS AND AT THE MACRO SCALE THE CLASSICAL WORLD
HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CATS BEING INVOLVED AND THE CATS ARE ALWAYS THREATENED BUT NEVER HARMED AND IN THAT
WORTH IT FOR WHAT'S GOING TO OCCUR SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE
AND ACTUALLY QUANTUM PARTICLES INTERACTING ARE THE SAME AS MAKING OBSERVATIONS AND
THAT I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE THIS FACT BUT THE UNIVERSE DOES NOT
WHERE THE COMPUTER'S HARDWARE'S OPERATING SYSTEM IS QUANTUM PHYSICS I WANT MORE THAN THAT AND I GUESS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS
WHERE HALF THE TIME THE BALL'S GOING TO BOUNCE AROUND AND GO
OF OBSERVATION TAMPERS WITH IT AND IT THEREFORE ALTERS THE
WHAT'S MY RELATIONSHIP WITH LIFE THIS LIFE THIS BIOLOGICAL CHEMICAL THING THAT'S HAPPENING I LOOKED INTO A MIRROR ONE DAY WHEN I WAS
HOW TO START
AS I SAID I HAD NOT WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY OR DONE ANYTHING RELATED TO SPACE
SO WHAT DOES ANY GUY IN THAT SITUATION DO HE FINDS A FRIEND AND STARTS A BLOG
STARTING A BLOG IS ACTUALLY A
STUDENTS AND GRADUATES FROM DIFFERENT FIELDS SUCH AS PHYSICS ARCHITECTURE AND
JUST COUPLE OF US INTERESTED GUYS WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT GREENHOUSES BUT SOMETHING
ALL OUR EGGS ARE BASICALLY IN ONE BASKET AND I THINK WE NEED
ARE GROWN IN THE WINGS AND THE CENTER PART PROVIDES SHELTER FOR
WERE ACTUALLY WILLING TO DO WORK LIKE THIS FOR FREE
JUST TO DO SPACE EXPLORATION
HOW WONDERFUL
THAT COMMUNITY ACTUALLY CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH
ALL THE REST OF THE TOOLS YOU NEED
ALL THE SKILLS YOU ARE LACKING AT THAT POINT
AND SO FORTH
IT KIND OF SUPPORTS YOU
ON THIS TRIP AND WHAT'S GREAT
ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD WE
WON THE DEPLOYABLE GREENHOUSE CHALLENGE BUT THAT WAS NOT THE BEST THING WE LEARNED DOING THAT THING
IF
YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT COMPLICATED
WE STARTED OFF WITH TOOLS LIKE PEN AND PAPER
A FACEBOOK GROUP AND SOME GOOGLE DOCS
WHEN
WE JOINED THE COMPETITION WHAT WE WERE FACED
WITH FIRST AND WHAT WE FOUND
WAS THIS COMMUNITY
THESE
MARS IS OF COURSE A SOMEWHAT HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT ONE DANGER IS
TEACHES LOT IF
WE TAKE THAT PICTURE AND WE WANT TO CREATE THAT THING
IT MEANS WE HAVE TO REDESIGN ALMOST EVERYTHING WE HAVE HERE ON EARTH AND TAKE IT TO SPACE
IF WE WANT
TO OBEY THOSE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE AND I THINK WE HAVE TO
LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE
WE'VE SEEN ACTUALLY PRETTY MANY GOOD EXAMPLES ABOUT THIS DURING THIS EVENING FOR EXAMPLE THE ROBOT BUT LET'S TAKE A SIMPLER EXAMPLE LIKE THAT SHIRT THE GIRL IS WEARING OVER THERE
WAS
A LIST OF CHALLENGES ME AND MY FRIENDS DECIDED TO DO THE ONE CALLED DEPLOYABLE GREENHOUSE'
WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING A GREENHOUSE SENDING IT TO MARS AND GROWING PLANTS OVER
THERE PRETTY SOON WE UNDERSTOOD THAT JUST GROWING PLANTS ON MARS IS NOT ENOUGH WE HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER
SO I'LL SHOW YOU
THING IT MAKES YOU COME OUT WITH YOUR PASSION WITH THIS MISSION OF MINE SO IT BROKE THE ICE BEFORE THAT I WAS KIND OF INTIMIDATED TO TALK ABOUT BIG THINGS LIKE THESE NOW I'M PROUDER AND MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT
I HAD NOT STUDIED IT I HAD NOT DONE ANY RESEARCH I HAD NOT WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY
BUT I'M STANDING HERE WHAT HAPPENED
FIRST PART OF WHY
THIS ALL HAPPENED
IS LIFE
I JUST
ALL THIS WAS GREAT FUN AND IN THE END WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF OUR
ALL THE LIFE WE KNOW IS CONFINED ON THAT LITTLE PLANET
REALLY ALL KINDS OF SKILLS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPACE HOTELS WE NEED SOMEONE WHO DECORATES THEM AND MAKES THEM MORE COMFORTABLE AND YOU KNOW FUN TO LIVE IN WE NEED ALL KINDS OF SKILLS
IT HAPPENS SO WE ARE HUMAN AND UNDERSTANDING OUR NEEDS IS ACTUALLY GOLD THOSE NEEDS DRIVE THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS TOGETHER HOW WE DO OUR
IF WE WANT TO HAVE THAT SHIRT IN SPACE IT CAN'T BE MADE LIKE WE DO IT HERE ON EARTH
CAN'T BE JUST A LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM IT HAS TO PROVIDE THE ASTRONAUTS WITH A LIFE WORTH
TO DO WITH MY LIFE
AND I SAW
A MAN
WITH A HEAD
AND THESE ARMS THAT CAN DO THIS
AND A TALKING MOUTH
AND
I REALIZED THAT I HAVE SUPERPOWERS I MEAN REAL SUPERPOWERS YOU ALL HAVE
WOULD HAVE MADE SURE NEITHER OF THESE EVENTS WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED
THROUGHOUT MY TIME AS CHIEF OF PROTOCOL
I HAVE INVARIABLY BEEN ASKED TWO QUESTIONS
WHAT DO YOU DO
AND PROTOCOL WHAT'S THAT
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT PEOPLE THINK
BUT PROBABLY DON'T SAY OUT LOUD AT LEAST NOT TO ME
FOR ONE THING
FOLLOWING PROTOCOL CAN MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD
HEY
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO LOOK GOOD
NOT FOLLOWING PROTOCOL CAN SOMETIMES MAKE YOU LOOK RATHER FOOLISH
LIKE THAT GENTLEMAN WE HEARD TRYING TO SING
O CANADA
PROTOCOL MEANS YOU
MANY NATIONS HAVE A PROTOCOL FOR EXCHANGING BUSINESS CARDS
THIS MAY ALL SOUND KIND OF TRIVIAL BUT TRUST ME THEY ARE IMPORTANT
THIS IS WHERE PROTOCOL CAN BRING A SENSE OF CALMNESS
AND REALLY A SENSE OF FAMILIARITY TO AN EVENT
OR TO A MEETING
BUT JUST AS OUR LEADERS ARE GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE PEOPLE HERE
DIPLOMATS
AMBASSADORS AND HIGH COMMISSIONERS
THEY'RE REALLY THE SAME THING BY THE WAY EXCEPT HIGH COMMISSIONERS ARE FROM COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES
I WAS WATCHING TELEVISION THE OTHER NIGHT AND I SAW AN AD FOR AN INVESTMENT FIRM AND THEIR MOTTO WAS IT'S TIME TO BENCH THE BENCHMARKS THAT ALSO APPLIES IN PART TO PROTOCOL
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE WORD RULES IN THIS DEFINITION BECAUSE RULES IMPLIES THAT THEY'RE CAST IN STONE THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT THEY'RE NOT WELL THAT IS
THEY'RE GOING TO MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'VE NEVER MET BEFORE THEY WANT TO KNOW STUFF LIKE WHO'S GOING TO DO THE INTRODUCTIONS IS THERE GIFT EXCHANGE WHAT'S
IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1670 LONG BEFORE THERE WAS A UNITED STATES LONG BEFORE THERE WAS A CANADA ONE OF THE PROTOCOLS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY USED TO SAY THAT WHENEVER A MONARCH VISITED THIS PART OF THE WORLD
TO PARAPHRASE IT WENT LIKE THIS IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S THE BEST THING WE'VE COME UP WITH SO FAR
SCHOOLS HAVE PROTOCOLS THE MILITARY HAS PROTOCOLS
GOLFERS HAVE PROTOCOLS HOSPITALS HAVE PROTOCOLS
PENITENTIARIES HAVE PROTOCOLS
PROTOCOLS ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE EVERY DAY IN VIRTUALLY EVERY SECTION OF SOCIETY AND YOU PRACTICE PROTOCOLS SEVERAL TIMES EACH DAY IN YOUR WORKPLACE
YOU DO THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE RIGHT REASON
THAT SAME PERSON MAY ALSO END THEIR SPEECH BY SAYING SOMETHING
THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR PEOPLE THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR SUCCESS STORIES THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR CULTURE THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR PROTOCOLS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
EVER
RIGHT NOW TODAY
THERE ARE OVER 70 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THIS COUNTRY
BUT IN ADDITION TO HOW OUR CULTURE OUR SOCIETY AND OUR PROTOCOLS ARE CHANGING AS A RESULT OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCES
WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THAT FACT
THAT WE'RE CHANGING FROM THE INSIDE AS WELL
AS WE RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT OUR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OUR FIRST NATIONS
IT'S REALLY BECOME PART OF OUR CULTURE ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO A YOUNG SINGER NAMED BOB DYLAN WROTE A SONG CALLED THE TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGIN OH
HAVE YOU EVER TRAVELED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND BEEN CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY SOME OF THE CUSTOMS THAT ARE IN PLACE CHANCES ARE FOR SOME OF
THE BEST COMPLIMENTS A PROTOCOL OFFICE CAN RECEIVE IS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW PROTOCOL'S EVEN INVOLVED AT ALL WHEN EVERYONE THINKS THAT WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IS JUST HAPPENING NATURALLY THE UNIVERSE IS UNFOLDING AS IT SHOULD YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE
PROTOCOL CAN MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD THAT'S ONLY TRUE MOST OF THE TIME
LOWERED IT WHEN FORMER PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER DIED SHE LOWERED IT WHEN 9 11 HAPPENED SHE LOWERED IT WHEN THE LONDON SUBWAYS WERE BOMBED IN 2005 SO YOU CAN SEE PROTOCOLS CAN AND ARE CHANGING AT EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY
ATTENTION TO DETAILS IT CAN MAKE EVERYTHING FLOW IT PUTS PEOPLE AT EASE
DID IS THEY GIFTED IN THE QUEEN'S NAME TWO BLACK LIVING
IN 1984 WHEN THE QUEEN VISITED MANITOBA THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY WANTED TO HONOR THAT PROTOCOL BUT THEY RECOGNIZED TIMES HAD CHANGED AND PROTOCOLS HAD CHANGED SO
CONSULS GENERAL ARE CONTINUOUSLY VISITING CITIES ACROSS THIS NATION AND REGIONS ACROSS THE NATION
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY HALF A CENTURY THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND BEGAN TO FEEL A DISCONNECT WITH THEIR QUEEN WHAT CAUSED THAT PROTOCOL BUT SINCE THAT
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED NOT ONLY DID HE NOT GET THE TUNE RIGHT HE DIDN'T GET THE WORDS RIGHT EITHER AND OF COURSE WHO CAN
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER IT'S EVERYONE THANK YOU MERCI AND MIIGWECH {NS}
{NS} BUT PROTOCOL LIKE EVERYTHING HAS TO CHANGE TO KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES EARLIER I
AN UPROAR FROM THE MEDIA AND AN OUTCRY FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC NO FLAG WAS FLYING AT HALF MAST ON BUCKINGHAM PALACE FINALLY ON THE DAY OF THE
EVER WE'RE NOW LIVING IN A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS NATION HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
TO THE ASSINIBOINE ZOO JUST AS AN ASIDE I CAN TELL YOU THAT DURING THE CEREMONY AND HER MAJESTY WAS THERE FOR THE
SHE REPORTEDLY IS TO HAVE SAID
FRISKY LITTLE DEVILS AREN'T THEY
THROUGHOUT MY CAREER
I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN SEVERAL MAJOR EVENTS
LIKE ROYAL VISITS LIKE VISITS FROM HEADS OF STATE
I'VE ALSO BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN TRADE MISSIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN ME TO COUNTRIES
VIRTUALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO PRACTICE PROTOCOL IF IT'S ANY COMFORT I CAN TELL YOU I CAN'T RECALL A SINGLE EVENT
NOT ONE
THAT'S EVER REALLY GONE JUST EXACTLY THE WAY I WANTED IT TO
AS I'VE SAID KEEP CALM
AND CARRY ON
BUT
IF PROTOCOL LIKE EVERYTHING DOESN'T CHANGE WITH THE TIMES IT CAN HAVE
SOMEWHAT OF A NEGATIVE IMPACT
POPE FRANCIS EARLIER THIS YEAR
SAID IT WAS TIME FOR THE CHURCH TO RETHINK
HOW IT LOOKS UPON MARGINALIZED MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
IN OTHER WORDS
IT WAS TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR PROTOCOLS
BECAUSE THE PROTOCOLS THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES
MAYBE CENTURIES
AREN'T RELEVANT IN TODAY'S SOCIETY
IN SIMPLE TERMS THEY DON'T WORK
EVEN PROTOCOL
WILL ONLY FLY UPON A BUILDING OR PALACE WHENEVER SHE IS THERE
MY OWN PERSONAL DEFINITION OF PROTOCOL USED TO BE SIMPLY
GOOD MANNERS AND COMMON SENSE
BUT GIVEN THE EVER CHANGING SOCIETY WE'RE IN
I WOULD HAVE TO ADD THE PHRASE WITH RESPECT
IT IS GOOD MANNERS AND COMMON SENSE WITH A HEALTHY DOSE OF RESPECT
RESPECT FOR WHERE YOU ARE WHO YOU'RE WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND RESPECT FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING
BUT ONE THING AT THE TOP OF THEIR MIND OF THE LEADER'S MIND THAT'S GOING TO TRAVEL TO ANOTHER NATION IS PROTOCOL BECAUSE
LET'S BE HONEST FOR A MOMENT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD EITHER ONE OF THOSE PHRASES 20 YEARS AGO
THE QUEEN HAS LOWERED THE FLAG ON BUCKINGHAM PALACE SEVERAL TIMES SHE LOWERED IT WHEN THE QUEEN MOTHER DIED
GENEVA CONVENTION PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TWICE SINCE THEY WERE FIRST ESTABLISHED WHY BECAUSE THE TIMES DEMANDED THAT THAT THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE
WE NEED TO CHANGE HOW WE SHOW RESPECT AND WE NEED TO RESPECT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE
THE PREMIERS THE MAYORS MEMBERS OF CABINET
AND THEY WANT TO MEET THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY EDUCATION
SCIENCE AND INNOVATION
WHENEVER A DIPLOMAT IS VISITING PROTOCOL CAN AND WILL PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENSURING THAT VISIT IS POSITIVE PRODUCTIVE
AND A SUCCESS
MANY OF YOU THE ANSWER IS YES
HAVE YOU EVER PUT OUT YOUR HAND FOR A HANDSHAKE AND INSTEAD THE PERSON KISSES YOU ON BOTH CHEEKS
IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU TRAVEL TO ANOTHER COUNTRY TO KNOW ABOUT THE CUSTOMS THE CULTURES AND THE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE IN PLACE
GOVERNMENTS FROM COAST TO COAST
ARE CONTINUOUSLY ORGANIZING TRADE MISSIONS TO OTHER NATIONS
THESE ARE COMPLICATED
COULD AND PROBABLY SHOULD BE THE OFFICIAL MOTTO OF ANYBODY INVOLVED IN PROTOCOL PROTOCOL TODAY IS OFTEN HEARD IN REFERENCE TO THE RULES OF GOVERNMENT
PEOPLE USED TO THINK OF PROTOCOL AS KNOWING WHICH SIDE OF THE PLATE THE FORK WENT ON OR HOW TO HOLD YOUR PINKIE WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING TEA BUT THOSE DAYS ARE LONG LONG GONE
THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND WERE DEMANDING THAT A FLAG BE FLOWN AT HALF MAST ON BUCKINGHAM PALACE THE QUEEN WASN'T IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND SO NO FLAG WAS FLOWN
SEGMENT ON THE EVENING NEWS LB THE CULTURE OF ENTITLEMENT IS UBIQUITOUS CH LB AMP TL WE'RE SUBJECTED DAILY TO WHAT'S ONLY FAIR TL EVERY TWO MINUTES AN AMERICAN IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CH
I HIT PUBERTY I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ENDURE AN EXISTENCE OF LONELINESS REJECTION AND UNFULFILLED DESIRES ALL BECAUSE GIRLS HAVE NEVER BEEN ATTRACTED TO ME IT'S AN INJUSTICE A CRIME CH A
ARE MORE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE CH LB AMP TL THAN THERE ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE EARNED DIPLOMAS TL I WAS RAISED IN A STORY WHERE CAUTION WAS USELESS LB AMP TL BECAUSE EVERY WOMAN OR CHILD COULD END UP WITH BRUISES
THEY TELL US HOW TO PREVENT THIS DON'T WALK ALONE AT NIGHT NEVER LEAVE DRINKS UNCOVERED OR UNATTENDED BE CAREFUL WEARING CLOTHES THAT GIVES SOMEONE THE WRONG IDEA IF YOU'RE BEING ATTACKED YELL FIRE INSTEAD OF RAPE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BELIEVE YOU LB
UP THE STAIRS TO MY ROOM AND JUST BEING ON MY COMPUTER FOR THE ENTIRE NIGHT UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR BED MY MOM COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS DOING UP THERE BUT I WAS ESSENTIALLY BREAKING MY COMPUTER AND THEN AND THEN FIXING IT AGAIN
TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO COOPERATE WITH AS MANY AS 30 PLAYERS AT ONE TIME TO COMPLETE A TASK
WHICH WOULD USUALLY TAKE ABOUT 4 HOURS
SO AFTER DOING THAT FOR WHILE I BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE I PLAYED WITH FREQUENTLY
EACH TIME THAT I PLAYED I WOULD LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEM
I WOULD LEARN THAT SOME ARE STUDENTS SOME ARE TEACHERS
SOME ARE HUSBANDS AND WIVES PLAYING TOGETHER
THEY WOULD TELL ME ABOUT THEIR FAMILY AND WHAT THEY DID THAT WEEKEND AND ALL THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THEIR LIVES
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS BECAUSE THE GAME LASTS PRACTICALLY ALL NIGHT
SO EACH SUBREDDIT ENDS UP TURNING INTO ITS OWN MICRO COMMUNITY AROUND THE SUBJECT
FOR EXAMPLE I JOINED THE DOGS COMMUNITY ON REDDIT AFTER ADOPTING MY FIRST PUPPY
SINCE NO ONE IN MY IMMEDIATE SOCIAL GROUP HAD A DOG AT THE TIME I CHOSE TO BREAK OUTSIDE OF MY FRIENDS LIST AND
RELY ON AN ONLINE COMMUNITY OF OVER 75000 PEOPLE FOR TRAINING TIPS
SO AFTER SPENDING ENOUGH TIME THERE I BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE OF REDDIT AND THERE WAS A TRUE SENSE OF BELONGING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WENT WITH IT
MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT USERS OF REDDIT OR REDDITORS' AS WE LIKE TO CALL OURSELVES END UP CREATING VERY THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS IN THE COMMENT SECTION
IT USED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE SOCIAL CONSTRUCT
BASED ON RELIGION EDUCATION RACE OR ETHNICITY IT ALMOST ALWAYS INCLUDED A GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTION
YOU INTERACTED DIRECTLY OR PHYSICALLY WITH THE COMMUNITIES TO WHICH YOU BELONGED
BUT THE INTERNET ALLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE INCREASINGLY UNBOUNDED
BY BREAKING OUTSIDE OF OUR FRIENDS LIST WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH SOCIAL GROUPS OF ANY SIZE
AT OFTENTIMES A DEEPER LEVEL THAN WHAT WE CAN WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND US
SO I STARTED SPENDING EVEN MORE TIME ON MY COMPUTER
SO WHAT I LEARNED FROM JOINING REDDIT IS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS WHAT HAPPENED TO HAROLD PERCIVAL
HAROLD WAS A WORLD WAR II VETERAN WHO PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR AT THE AGE OF 99
HIS LOCAL NEWSPAPER WROTE ABOUT HOW HE HAD NO CLOSE FRIENDS OR FAMILY WHO COULD ATTEND HIS FUNERAL
SO IT WAS AN OPEN INVITATION FOR ANYONE TO JOIN
BECAUSE OTHERWISE NO ONE WOULD
THAT IS UNTIL THE IMAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER WAS UPLOADED TO IMGUR
AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY SHARED THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE INTERNET LANDING ON
MADE HIM HOUSEHOLD NAME FOR FEW WEEKS HE IS NOW NO LONGER
A MASSIVE COMMUNITY OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT ANY SUBJECT WE COULD IMAGINE
WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER AROUND VERY SPECIFIC INTERESTS AND GOALS
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO
ACTUALLY MAKE SOME REAL CHANGE IN THE WORLD
OTHER ANYMORE BUT THEY WERE CONNECTING ON MUCH DEEPER LEVEL AND BECOMING FRIENDS
COMMUNITIES LIKE WHAT I FOUND IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT CONSIST ALMOST ENTIRELY OF STRANGERS LOCATED ACROSS THE WORLD WHO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY SHARE THE SAME
COMMON INTEREST AND GOALS
EVEN IF SOME OF THOSE GOALS ARE AS SILLY AS BRINGING DOWN A BOSS IN A COMPUTER GAME
ONLINE
THAT ONE THING I'D ACQUIRED ASIDE FROM ALL THE SWEET ITEMS
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I HAD A DEEP PASSION FOR COMPUTERS
THIS VIDEO OF HIM FEATURING HIS GOLDEN RADIO VOICE REACHED THE INTERNET
BRINGING IT IN TO BE REPAIRED I WOULD JUST SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR A SOLUTION
AND ALMOST EVERY TIME I WOULD LAND UPON A COMMUNITY FORUM WHERE PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT THING WAS TRYING TO DO
IF I DIDN'T THEN I WOULD JUST POST TO A COMMUNITY FORUM TO ASK MY QUESTIONS AND THEN WAIT FOR ANSWER
SO WHAT MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW AT THE
THE MORE COMMUNITIES ON THE INTERNET THAT I BELONGED TO
THE MORE I REALIZED HOW BIG THEIR IMPACT ON THE WORLD WAS
BY BRINGING TOGETHER THE ENERGY OF HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ONLINE COMMUNITIES CAN ACHIEVE THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE PERSON TO ACHIEVE
ONLINE COMMUNITIES CAN HELP PEOPLE IN NEED
DEFEAT BAD GUYS AND SOLVE SOME OF THE TOUGHEST PROBLEMS OUT THERE
BY WORKING TOGETHER THE INTERNET IS THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO A REAL LIFE SUPERHERO
TO CREATE LONG LASTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET SO WHEN I FINALLY ESCAPED WORLD WARCRAFT THE NEXT COMMUNITY I JOINED ON THE INTERNET
INSTALLING NEW PARTS WRITING SMALL PROGRAMS TO MOVE FILES AROUND I EVEN WROTE A SMALL PROGRAM THAT SHUT DOWN THE COMPUTER AS SOON AS IT BOOTED UP
A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND THE DEATHS OF MILLIONS TWENTY OR 30 YEARS AGO IF A BANK IN NORTH AMERICA LENT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOWNSIDE OF GLOBALIZATION IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETIMES OVERWHELMING ALL OF THE GRAND CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOGRAPHICS AND TERRORISM AND PANDEMICS
OF YEARS AGO WE DISCOVERED THAT IF WE CARRIED ON DOING THE SAME THINGS WE WOULDN'T DIE BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE BY DEFINITION DIDN'T KILL US AND THEREFORE AS LONG AS WE CARRY ON DOING THEM WE'LL BE OKAY AND IT'S VERY SENSIBLE NOT TO DO ANYTHING NEW BECAUSE IT MIGHT KILL YOU
NOT GOING ON THERE'S COMPETITION BETWEEN COUNTRIES EACH ONE TRYING TO SHAFT THE NEXT THIS IS CLEARLY NOT A GOOD ARRANGEMENT WE CLEARLY NEED TO CHANGE IT WE CLEARLY NEED TO FIND WAYS OF ENCOURAGING COUNTRIES TO START WORKING TOGETHER A LITTLE
I'VE EVEN HAD ENOUGH HEARING ABOUT HAPPY COUNTRIES BECAUSE IN THE END THAT'S STILL SELFISH THAT'S STILL ABOUT US AND IF WE CARRY ON THINKING ABOUT US WE ARE IN DEEP DEEP TROUBLE
WRONG FOR THE SOLUTION OF GLOBAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT ALL LOOKS INWARDS
THE POLITICIANS THAT WE ELECT AND THE POLITICIANS WE DON'T ELECT ON THE WHOLE HAVE MINDS THAT MICROSCOPE THEY DON'T HAVE MINDS THAT TELESCOPE
THEY LOOK IN
THEY PRETEND THEY BEHAVE AS IF THEY BELIEVED THAT EVERY COUNTRY WAS AN ISLAND
THAT EXISTED QUITE HAPPILY INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL THE OTHERS
ON ITS OWN LITTLE PLANET IN ITS OWN LITTLE SOLAR SYSTEM
I'M GLAD THAT PERSON'S COUNTRY EXISTS ULTIMATELY THAT I THINK IS WHAT WILL MAKE THE CHANGE
LIKE A LOT OF US SPEND A LOT OF TIME COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE PEOPLE CHANGE AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FUSS ABOUT IT I THINK WE SHOULD JUST ACCEPT THAT WE ARE AN INHERENTLY CONSERVATIVE SPECIES WE DON'T LIKE TO CHANGE
IT EXISTS FOR VERY SENSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY REASONS WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T STILL BE HERE TODAY IF WE WEREN'T SO RESISTANT TO CHANGE IT'S VERY SIMPLE
TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT OUR POLITICIANS AND OUR COMPANIES BEHAVE AND IN DOING SO WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHICH ONE COMES TOP AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU BUT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO TELL YOU PRECISELY WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY A GOOD
WANT TO LIVE IN A RICH COUNTRY I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A FAST GROWING OR COMPETITIVE COUNTRY
I'VE STARTED THINKING VERY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT MY OWN COUNTRY SINCE I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS I USED TO THINK THAT I WANTED TO LIVE IN A RICH COUNTRY AND THEN I STARTED THINKING I WANTED TO LIVE IN A HAPPY COUNTRY BUT I BEGAN TO REALIZE IT'S NOT ENOUGH
IT'S THERE REALLY BECAUSE I WANT TO TRY TO INTRODUCE THIS WORD OR REINTRODUCE THIS WORD
INTO THE DISCOURSE
I'VE HAD ENOUGH HEARING ABOUT COMPETITIVE COUNTRIES I'VE HAD ENOUGH HEARING ABOUT PROSPEROUS WEALTHY FAST GROWING COUNTRIES
PROVES
THAT THIS SPECIES OF HUMANITY IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS
IF IT REALLY ACTS TOGETHER AND IT REALLY TRIES HARD
BUT IF I HAD TO PUT IT IN A NUTSHELL THESE DAYS I SORT OF FEEL THAT GLOBALIZATION HAS TAKEN US BY SURPRISE AND WE'VE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND TO IT
STILL PERSIST IN LOOKING INWARDS WELL THE FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS REASON IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ASK THEM TO DO THAT'S WHAT WE TELL THEM TO DO
REALLY SO VERY GOOD AT EMPATHY OH SURE WE'RE VERY GOOD AT EMPATHY WHEN IT'S A QUESTION OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO KIND OF LOOK LIKE US AND KIND OF WALK AND TALK AND EAT AND PRAY AND WEAR LIKE US
IN 2005 I LAUNCHED A STUDY CALLED THE NATION BRANDS INDEX WHAT IT IS IT'S A VERY LARGE SCALE STUDY THAT POLLS A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF THE WORLD'S
AROUND THEY DON'T SEE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS WITH DEEP RICH THREE DIMENSIONAL PERSONAL LIVES AND AIMS AND AMBITIONS WHAT THEY SEE IS
CARDBOARD CUTOUTS
AND IT'S VERY SAD AND IT'S VERY LONELY
AND IT'S VERY RARE FORTUNATELY
BUT ACTUALLY
AREN'T MOST OF US
WE ELECT GOVERNMENTS OR WHEN WE TOLERATE UNELECTED GOVERNMENTS
WE'RE EFFECTIVELY TELLING THEM THAT WHAT WE WANT IS FOR THEM TO DELIVER US IN OUR COUNTRY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THINGS
WE WANT THEM TO DELIVER PROSPERITY GROWTH COMPETITIVENESS
TRANSPARENCY JUSTICE AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS
AND OUR POLITICIANS TO A DEGREE CULTURAL PSYCHOPATHS
THE THIRD REASON IS HARDLY WORTH MENTIONING BECAUSE IT'S SO SILLY BUT THERE'S A BELIEF AMONGST GOVERNMENTS THAT THE DOMESTIC AGENDA AND THE INTERNATIONAL AGENDA ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND ALWAYS WILL BE
THIS IS JUST NONSENSE
BETTER SO THAT WE DON'T SIMPLY BECOME A SPECIES WHICH IS THE VICTIM OF THE GLOBALIZATION OF PROBLEMS
WHY ARE WE SO SLOW AT ACHIEVING THESE ADVANCES
WHAT'S THE REASON FOR IT
WELL THERE ARE OF COURSE A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT PERHAPS THE PRIMARY REASON IS BECAUSE WE'RE STILL ORGANIZED
AS A SPECIES IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE WERE ORGANIZED 200 OR 300 YEARS
A COUNTRY HAS A GREAT POSITIVE IMAGE LIKE GERMANY HAS OR SWEDEN OR SWITZERLAND EVERYTHING IS EASY AND EVERYTHING IS CHEAP YOU GET MORE TOURISTS YOU GET MORE INVESTORS YOU SELL YOUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVELY
ITS OWN POPULATION BUT TO THE REST OF HUMANITY BIZARRELY NOBODY HAD EVER THOUGHT OF MEASURING THIS BEFORE
SO MY COLLEAGUE DR ROBERT GOVERS AND I HAVE SPENT THE BEST PART OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE HELP OF A LARGE NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS AND CLEVER PEOPLE
CRAMMING TOGETHER ALL THE RELIABLE DATA IN THE WORLD WE COULD FIND ABOUT WHAT COUNTRIES GIVE
TO THE WORLD
NARCO TRAFFICKING AND HUMAN SLAVERY AND SPECIES LOSS I COULD GO ON
WE'RE NOT MAKING AN AWFUL LOT OF PROGRESS AGAINST AN AWFUL LOT OF THOSE CHALLENGES
SO IN A NUTSHELL THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ALL FACE TODAY AT THIS INTERESTING POINT IN HISTORY
THAT'S CLEARLY WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO NEXT
ANSWER IS NO BE VERY SUSPICIOUS
ASK YOURSELF IS THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF MY COUNTRY DO I WANT TO COME FROM A COUNTRY WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IN MY NAME IS DOING THINGS LIKE THAT
OR DO I ON THE OTHER HAND PREFER THE IDEA OF WALKING AROUND THE WORLD
IN THE DEPTHS OF A VERY SEVERE ECONOMIC RECESSION I THINK THAT THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT LESSON THERE THAT IF YOU CAN REMEMBER YOUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS WHILST YOU TRYING TO REBUILD YOUR OWN ECONOMY THAT'S REALLY
TO HUMANITY THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY I DON'T TALK ABOUT HOW THEY BEHAVE AT HOME BECAUSE THAT'S MEASURED ELSEWHERE
HEAD HELD HIGH THINKING YEAH I'M PROUD TO COME FROM A GOOD COUNTRY AND EVERYBODY WILL WELCOME YOU AND EVERYBODY IN THE LAST 15 SECONDS BEFORE THEY DRIFT OFF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WILL
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF THE LAST 10 OR 15 YEARS TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE THAT SELF INTEREST THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE NOT JUST POLITICIANS BUT ALSO BUSINESSES AND GENERAL POPULATIONS ALL OF US TO START TO THINK A LITTLE MORE OUTWARDLY TO THINK IN A BIGGER PICTURE NOT ALWAYS TO LOOK INWARDS SOMETIMES TO LOOK OUTWARDS
AND THIS IS WHERE I DISCOVERED
SOMETHING QUITE
THIS IS QUITE AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY AND AS SOON AS I DISCOVERED THIS I FELT ANOTHER INDEX COMING ON I SWEAR THAT AS I GET OLDER MY IDEAS BECOME SIMPLER AND MORE AND MORE CHILDISH THIS ONE IS CALLED THE GOOD COUNTRY INDEX
THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE WORLD RECENTLY AND HOW IT'S CHANGED OVER THE LAST 20 30 40 YEARS TWENTY OR 30 YEARS
WAYS IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEY'VE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME OVER THE LAST DECADES BUILDING THEIR OWN ECONOMY BUILDING THEIR OWN SOCIETY AND THEIR OWN POLITY BUT IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE SECOND PHASE OF THEIR GROWTH WILL BE SOMEWHAT MORE OUTWARD LOOKING THAN THE FIRST PHASE HAS BEEN SO FAR
WHY DID I DO THIS WELL BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS THAT I ADVISE ARE VERY VERY KEEN ON KNOWING HOW THEY ARE REGARDED
THEY'VE KNOWN PARTLY BECAUSE I'VE ENCOURAGED THEM TO REALIZE IT
THAT COUNTRIES DEPEND ENORMOUSLY ON THEIR REPUTATIONS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND PROSPER IN THE WORLD
WHERE I'M GOING BECAUSE IT SQUARES THE CIRCLE I CAN NOW SAY AND OFTEN DO TO ANY GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO DO WELL YOU NEED TO DO GOOD IF YOU WANT TO SELL MORE PRODUCTS IF YOU WANT TO GET MORE
UNLESS WE START ASKING OUR GOVERNMENTS TO THINK OUTSIDE A LITTLE BIT TO CONSIDER THE GLOBAL PROBLEMS THAT WILL FINISH US ALL IF WE DON'T START CONSIDERING THEM
THEN WE CAN HARDLY BLAME THEM IF WHAT THEY CARRY ON DOING IS LOOKING INWARDS IF THEY STILL HAVE MINDS THAT MICROSCOPE RATHER THAN MINDS THAT TELESCOPE THAT'S THE FIRST REASON WHY THINGS TEND NOT TO
DEPRESSED ME BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID NOT WANT TO DISCOVER WITH THIS INDEX IS THAT IT'S PURELY THE PROVINCE OF RICH COUNTRIES TO HELP POOR COUNTRIES THIS IS NOT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
IF YOU LOOK FURTHER DOWN THE LIST I DON'T HAVE THE SLIDE HERE YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING THAT MADE ME VERY HAPPY INDEED THAT KENYA IS IN THE TOP 30
6 8 I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO EXPLAIN IN DETAIL BASICALLY WHAT IT TOLD
DON'T ADMIRE COUNTRIES PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY'RE RICH BECAUSE THEY'RE POWERFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE MODERN BECAUSE THEY'RE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED WE PRIMARILY ADMIRE COUNTRIES THAT ARE GOOD
AND OUR IDEAS AND OUR TEACHING AND OUR LEARNING AROUND THE PLANET EVER FASTER AND EVER CHEAPER IT'S BROUGHT A LOT OF BAD STUFF
AND SO YOU MAY SAY WELL GIVEN ALL OF THAT WHY THEN DOESN'T IT WORK WHY CAN WE NOT MAKE OUR POLITICIANS CHANGE WHY CAN'T WE DEMAND THEM
IT COMES TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO THAT WHO DON'T QUITE DRESS LIKE US AND DON'T QUITE PRAY LIKE US AND DON'T QUITE TALK LIKE US DO WE NOT ALSO HAVE TENDENCY TO SEE THEM EVER SO SLIGHTLY AS CARDBOARD CUTOUTS TOO AND
IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN IT MEASURES OR AT LEAST IT TRIES TO MEASURE EXACTLY HOW MUCH EACH COUNTRY ON EARTH
GOOD BEING A COUNTRY THAT THINKS ABOUT ALL OF US THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO AND I'D LIKE YOU TO USE IT AS A STICK WITH WHICH TO BEAT YOUR POLITICIANS
THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE A COUNTRY WITH A VERY WEAK OR VERY NEGATIVE IMAGE EVERYTHING IS DIFFICULT AND EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE SO GOVERNMENTS CARE DESPERATELY ABOUT THE IMAGE OF THEIR COUNTRY BECAUSE IT MAKES A DIRECT DIFFERENCE TO HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN MAKE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE PROMISED THEIR POPULATIONS THEY'RE GOING TO DELIVER
ONE VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING THIS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY THIS IS ABOUT ATTITUDE
THIS IS ABOUT CULTURE
THIS IS ABOUT A GOVERNMENT AND A PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD AND HAVE THE IMAGINATION AND THE COURAGE TO THINK OUTWARDS INSTEAD OF ONLY THINKING
THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE PLANET'S POPULATION AND I STARTED ASKING THEM A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY PERCEIVE OTHER COUNTRIES
AND THE NATION BRANDS INDEX OVER THE YEARS HAS GROWN TO BE A VERY VERY LARGE DATABASE IT'S ABOUT 200 BILLION DATA POINTS TRACKING WHAT ORDINARY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES AND WHY
BY TREATING IT AS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM LOOKING AT THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT COMPARING WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE BRINGING IN OTHERS WORKING EXTERNALLY INSTEAD OF WORKING INTERNALLY
ORGANIZED THEY'RE STILL ORGANIZED IN 200 OR SO NATION STATES
AND THE NATIONS HAVE GOVERNMENTS
THAT MAKE RULES
AND CAUSE US TO BEHAVE IN CERTAIN WAYS
AND THAT'S PRETTY EFFICIENT SYSTEM
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE WAY THAT THOSE LAWS ARE MADE AND THE WAY THOSE GOVERNMENTS THINK
MONEY TO SOME PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD TO PAY IT BACK AND THE BANK WENT BUST THAT WAS BAD FOR THE LENDER AND BAD FOR THE BORROWER BUT WE DIDN'T IMAGINE IT WOULD BRING THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM TO ITS KNEES FOR NEARLY A DECADE THIS IS
MEAN BY GOOD WE MEAN COUNTRIES THAT SEEM TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE COUNTRIES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THE WORLD SAFER OR BETTER OR RICHER OR FAIRER THOSE ARE THE COUNTRIES WE LIKE THIS IS A DISCOVERY OF SIGNIFICANT
PLAYING ALL OF THE TIME AND THEN SUDDENLY IT'S OVER AND IT'S ONLY TAKEN FIVE MINUTES AND
CAN WE DO THIS AGAIN FROM THE TOP EXCEPT USE SOME PEOPLE WITH A VAGUE HINT OF TALENT INSTEAD OF JUST
STRUCK OUT WITH THINGS THAT WERE SO STUPID AND BANAL THAT EVEN THE CITY OF NEW YORK WAS FORCED TO GO OH I'M REALLY SORRY WE SCREWED UP
IS THE BUILT FORM OF OUR CULTURAL AMBITIONS WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN PRESENTED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECTIFY A SITUATION THAT REPRESENTS
ELECTRONIC KEY RATHER THAN THE REAL KEY ZIPPED HOME ON THEIR NEW SUPERHIGHWAY AND DROVE STRAIGHT INTO A GARAGE THAT LOOKS LIKE A TUDOR CASTLE {LG}
ONE OR AT LEAST THEY CRAVED ONE THE MOMENT THEY SAW ONE AND THEN THEY
ARCHITECTS IN TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT ARCHITECTURE FROM THE KIND OF TECHNOCRATIC SOLUTION
IT'S TALKED ABOUT ALL THE TIME AT THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN WEAPONIZE YOUR BUILDINGS YOU HAVE TO SUDDENLY THINK ABOUT ARCHITECTURE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
AND WRITING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE A TIME WHEN FIVE PEOPLE SAT ME DOWN AT A TABLE AND ASKED ME VERY SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT ZONING
FIRE EXITING
SAFETY CONCERNS AND WHETHER CARPET BURNS THESE ARE JUST NOT THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT VERY OFTEN
YOU KNOW THAT ALL OF THE COOL PEOPLE ARE THEY'RE DOING IT AND YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE YOU'RE AT HOME YOU'RE LIKE THE RASPYNI BROTHERS WHERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR
THE WAY WE WENT TO DESCRIBE THAT LATER MANIFEST
DESTINY
NOW WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER BE A GRID
OR MANIFEST DESTINY
MANIFEST DESTINY
IT'S A BIG DEAL
IT
INSTEAD OF Z AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT ANY KIND OF CONVERSATION ABOUT ARCHITECTURE WHICH IS IN FACT WHAT YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE SETTING
{LG} IT'S IN OUR NATURE TO GO RICOCHETING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THIS
WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMPETITION AFTER SIX PREVIOUS FIRMS
AND OPTIMISM TOGETHER YOU'VE GOT TWO CHOICES THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT CREATIONISM WHICH I THINK WOULDN'T GO DOWN WELL WITH THIS AUDIENCE AT LEAST NOT FROM A VIEW WHERE YOU WERE A PROPONENT OF IT OR YOU CAN TALK
SO NOW YOU WONDER WHY I THREW THIS TOMATO AWAY
HELP AGAINST PREDATORS FOR THE TOMATO NATURAL EVOLUTION HAS DONE THAT
WE HAVE TO GO TO SOMETHING ELSE WHAT ELSE IN THE
THAT THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES WE PAY FOR IT AND WE DON'T DISCUSS IT
WELL THIS IS VERY POWERFUL DIVERSITY
THAT ARE SELF SUSTAINABLE RESILIENT CARING FOR THE PEOPLE CARING FOR NATURE SHARING THIS IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF
SO WITH FERMES D'AVENIR WITH MAXIME WE SAID HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE AMBITIOUS WHY DO WE HAVE TO BE AMBITIOUS
TO GET THE FINANCE TO GET THE PLANIFICATION OF
AND WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN PLACES WHERE THE LANDSCAPE IS BEAUTIFUL AND THEN THEY CAN GET
THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FIRST ONE WAS DECARBONATE THE
OBSERVATORY IN LA BOURDAISI RE AND WE PLANTED ON PRAIRIE WHY ON PRAIRIE BECAUSE IT'S FLAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAS BEEN THERE BEFORE
THIS IS THE MODEL WE HAVE EXPORTED FOR THE LAST 60 YEARS CHECK ON THE WEBSITE IT'S TERRIFYING IN GROWING COUNTRIES
PLANTING AND YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT IS A POLITICAL ACT
FOOD THIS IS A RED TOMATO
THERE TO TRY TO PUT A VALUE TO THE EXTERNALITIES BUT THE OTHER FIGURE WHICH WAS MIND BOGGLING
PREPARING A MEAL COOKING ALL TOGETHER IS A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE FROM THERE
IF THIS IS DEGRADING THE SOIL IF THIS IS DEGRADING THE ECOSYSTEM WE HAVE TO PUT A VALUE ON THAT
CLEAR OBJECTIVE WE HAVE TO LIMIT THE EMISSION OF CARBON
WE HAVE TO CREATE MORE AND MORE FARMS
500 DIFFERENT PLANTS 500 TIMES MORE THAN CONVENTIONAL
ONE THAT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE ECOLOGICALLY SOUND
ON CROSS BORDER TRADE IN EAST AFRICA GOING BACK 20
NO ATTEMPT AT INTEGRATING THE INFORMAL ECONOMIC ECOSYSTEM WITH THE FORMAL OR EVEN THE GLOBAL
ONE THE HIDDEN MIDDLE
AND SHE'S ONLY THE FIRST RUNG
OF THE SMALL ENTREPRENEURS THE MICRO BUSINESSES THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THESE MARKET TOWNS AT LEAST IN THE LARGER
MALABA BORDER SHE'S AT THE FIRST
AROUND 20000 US DOLLARS INVESTED IN TRADE GOODS AND SERVICES EVERY YEAR THIS IS TERESIA
DISCIPLINES BUT CAN YOU MAKE A FRENCH FRY MACHINE OUT OF AN OLD CAR SO THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IS WHAT SO DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE
TURNED OUT THAT IT WASN'T THE CRIMINALIZATION YOU CAN'T REALLY CRIMINALIZE SOMEONE YOU'RE CHARGING RECEIPTS
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND SO THEY'RE INVISIBLE TO DATA GATHERERS AND THEY'RE MASHED TOGETHER WITH THE VAST INFORMAL
FOOD ON YOUR TABLE EVEN HERE IN THIS HOTEL THE INVISIBLE ONES THE BUTCHERS THE
SHE SPENDS 10 TIMES THAT AMOUNT EVERY MONTH JUST ON INVENTORY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
THE CUSTOMIZED DOORWAYS FOR THEM TO ENTER OR INTEGRATE WITH THE FORMAL WITH THE GLOBAL WITH THE ENTIRE SYSTEM THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
VULNERABLE AFRICAN WOMAN TRADER BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
WE WERE EXPECTING ACCORDING TO THE LITERATURE TO THE RESEARCH RIGHT DOWN TO SHE WAS SINGLE MOM DRIVEN TO TRADE SUPPORTING HER
VERY NEGATIVE AND IT'S HAD SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES AND ECONOMIC
THESE ARE THE ONES WHO FIT NEITHER THE POLICY STEREOTYPE OF THE LOW SKILLED AND THE MARGINALIZED NOR THE WHITE COLLAR SALARIED OFFICE WORKER OR CIVIL SERVANT WITH A PENSION THAT THE MIDDLE CLASSES ARE ALLEGEDLY
SECTOR IS GROWING JOBS AT FOUR TIMES THE RATE OF THE TRADITIONAL FORMAL ECONOMY OR MODERN ECONOMY AS MANY CALL IT IT OFFERS EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME GENERATION OPPORTUNITIES TO THE MOST UNSKILLED
THE OCCUPATIONS WE COULD TRANSFORM THE INFORMAL ECONOMY BY BEGINNING WITH THIS RECOGNITION AND
THE GOODS IN OR THE MOBILE MONEY AGENT WHO COMES TO COLLECT CASH AT THE END OF THE EVENING
WHAT WE DISCOVERED OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS WAS NOBODY HAD DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN ILLICIT WHICH IS LIKE SMUGGLING OR CONTRABAND IN THE INFORMAL SECTOR FROM THE LEGAL BUT
IT'S NO SECRET THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE ABLE TO INTERCEPT TELEPHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGES IT'S FOR THAT
SHOULD NOTE ALSO THAT GAMMA NEVER ACTUALLY SOLD THEIR SOFTWARE TO THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT THEY'D SENT THEM AN INVOICE FOR A SALE BUT THE EGYPTIANS NEVER BOUGHT IT INSTEAD APPARENTLY THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT USED A FREE DEMO VERSION
TOO SO GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN EMBRACING THIS TECHNOLOGY THEY'VE BEEN EMBRACING HACKING AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNIQUE BUT WITHOUT ANY REAL DEBATE
TEAM HAS WHAT IS PROBABLY THE SLICKEST PRESENTATION THE VIDEO THEY'VE PRODUCED IS VERY
IN THE BUSINESS AS I SAID IT'S A 5 BILLION INDUSTRY ONE OF THE OTHER BIG GUYS IN THE INDUSTRY IS AN ITALIAN COMPANY CALLED HACKING TEAM
USE THE SAME KINDS OF COMPUTERS THERE'S NO DRUG DEALER PHONE AND THERE'S NO JOURNALIST LAPTOP WE ALL USE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT THAT MEANS THEN IS THAT FOR GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO HACK INTO THE COMPUTERS OF THE REAL BAD GUYS THEY ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO HACK
ONES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE EXPERTISE AND SO THERE'S THIS MARKET OF WESTERN COMPANIES WHO ARE HAPPY TO SUPPLY THEM WITH THE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR A PRICE GAMMA IS JUST ONE OF THESE COMPANIES
IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF IT WASN'T TRUE BUT IN FACT HACKING TEAM'S SOFTWARE IS BEING SOLD TO GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD LAST YEAR WE LEARNED FOR EXAMPLE THAT IT'S BEEN USED TO TARGET MOROCCAN JOURNALISTS BY THE MOROCCAN
THAT DON'T REALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BUILD THEIR OWN TOOLS WILL BUY OFF THE SHELF SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE
TELL YOU FOR SURE THAT HACKING TEAM HAS SOLD THEIR TECHNOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF THEY HAVEN'T SOLD IT IT ISN'T BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRYING HARD
IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO THE COMPANY HAS OPENED A SALES OFFICE IN MARYLAND THE COMPANY HAS ALSO HIRED A SPOKESPERSON THEY'VE BEEN ATTENDING
HEARD OF THIS UNIT BEFORE I'VE BEEN STUDYING SURVEILLANCE FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS I'D NEVER HEARD OF IT AND SO I WENT ONLINE AND I DID SOME RESEARCH AND ULTIMATELY
HAS SAID THAT HE INTENDS FOR HIS SOFTWARE TO BE USED TO CAPTURE TERRORISTS AND LOCATE
WEBCAM LIGHT WON'T TURN ON THERE'S NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT THE MICROPHONE IS ENABLED
THE 2011 ARAB SPRING CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD IT ALSO CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHO WERE WORRIED THAT REVOLUTION WOULD SPREAD
AT THE CONFERENCES WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MOST FASCINATING WAS THEY'VE ACTUALLY PAID FOR
TO NOTE THAT MOST GOVERNMENTS DON'T REALLY HAVE THE IN HOUSE CAPABILITIES TO DEVELOP THIS SOFTWARE
GAMMA AND HACKING TEAM THE FBI ALSO HAS THE CAPABILITY TO REMOTELY ACTIVATE WEBCAMS MICROPHONES STEAL DOCUMENTS GET WEB BROWSING INFORMATION THE WORKS
MIGHT USE THE SAME SOFTWARE AS THE GOVERNMENT OF GERMANY THEY'RE ALL BUYING OFF THE SHELF STUFF
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION IN THE UNITED STATES DOES HAVE THE BUDGET TO BUILD THEIR OWN SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND SO FOR SEVERAL YEARS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF AND HOW THE FBI IS HACKING INTO THE COMPUTERS OF SURVEILLANCE TARGETS
OF FORMER U S GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS WHO HAD AT ONE POINT WORKED FOR THE REMOTE OPERATING UNIT
HE'S ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ONCE THE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN SOLD TO GOVERNMENTS HE HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW IT CAN BE USED
INTO THE COMPUTERS OF SURVEILLANCE TARGETS RATHER THAN INTERCEPTING THE COMMUNICATIONS AS THEY GO OVER THE WIRE INSTEAD THEY NOW HACK INTO YOUR COMPUTER ENABLE YOUR WEBCAM ENABLE YOUR MICROPHONE AND STEAL DOCUMENTS FROM YOUR COMPUTER
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT FELL IN 2011
END OF CULTURE THE END OF HUMANITY EXTINCTION
Y'ALL THE STORY WE TELL ABOUT THE FUTURE IS TERRIFYING OK A LOT
OF SCIENCE FICTION SHOWS US HEROES TRYING TO DEFEND OUR HUMANITY WHEN IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE AS STORYTELLERS WE KNOW WHAT WE IMAGINE WE'RE LIKELY TO CREATE
WHEN WE SEE THE PRODUCTS OF OUR CULTURE'S IMAGINATION WE FEEL AN URGENT NEED TO FIND SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW
YOU SEE
WE ARE SUSPENDED BETWEEN
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW
IS A WASTELAND
A NUCLEAR WINTER
SPACESHIPS WITH NO HOME TO RETURN TO THE POLAR ICECAPS HAVE MELTED AND OUR CITIES ARE UNDERWATER WE ARE NOT MEANT TO SAVE THE EARTH
WE ARE MEANT TO LEAVE IT BEHIND CONSUMED DISCARDED WE MOVE TO COLONIZE THE STARS WE ARE ON THE EVE OF A TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION
WE ERASE THE LINE BETWEEN MAN AND MACHINE
WE ARE DIVIDED
BY OUR
IMPERFECTIONS AND OUR WEAKNESS BETRAYS US
AUTOMATION LEADS TO ROBO SUPREMACY DESTRUCTION
THE
YEARS SINCE HENRY'S REIGN THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF REVOLUTIONS TRYING TO END THIS TYRANNY
AND
END THE EXPLOITATION OF THE MANY BY THE PRIVILEGED FEW
FROM FRANCE TO HAITI FROM THE STREETS TO OUR HOMES REVOLUTIONARY FREEDOM FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN EXPANDING THE NOTION THAT LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS ARE ACTUALLY UNDENIABLE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE
YET IN EACH TRYING TO GET FREE OURSELVES WE HAVE NOT LEARNED HOW TO BE FREE TOGETHER
ONE DAY
AS I WAS ABOUT TO SIGN UP FOR THAT NEXT PHYSICS CLASS I JUST
WASN'T ABLE TO KEEP GOING DOWN A PATH OF TRYING TO PROVE MYSELF
A DREAM THAT I HAD NOT LET MYSELF TAKE SERIOUSLY FOR LONG TIME
BEGAN TO TUG AT ME AGAIN A DREAM I HAD BEEN MORE CONNECTED TO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN I WROTE AND ILLUSTRATED MY FIRST BOOK THE ADVENTURES OF THE TRAVELING CATS
A
ENDEMIC DISEASES LIKE EBOLA AND ZIKA
A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICER VISIONS OF DIPLOMATIC SUGARPLUMS
THE INSURGENCY EVAPORATED
WHAT WE COULDN'T DO
WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND BOMBS AND MILITARY OPERATIONS
WE ACCOMPLISHED
THROUGH
THIS AMAZING AGRICULTURAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE
ENHANCEMENT
BUT IT WAS IN THE EIGHT VILLAGES I WORKED IN IN THE MEKONG DELTA THAT I LEARNED THE GREAT LESSON OF MY LIFE
MOA REPRESENTING THE GRAND AYATOLLAH I TOLD THEM THE STORIES OF IOWA AND HOW AT THE MOST DANGEROUS MOMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY
1959 WHEN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WERE POISED TO BE FIRED AT EACH OTHER BY THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES
PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV CAME
TO IOWA VISITED A FARM AND THAT LED TO AN
MONTHS AND IF YOU'RE STILL ALIVE WE'LL PICK YOU UP AND
AND THE CHANGE WAS DRAMATIC IT WAS INCREDIBLE ALMOST OVERNIGHT FARMERS WENT TO HAVING SURPLUS SO THEY COULD NOW IMPROVE THEIR HOMES THEIR FAMILIES WERE BETTER DRESSED THEIR CHILDREN MORE WELL
AND HE SAID
ROADS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
THAT'S THE LESSON
THAT'S
WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED MY MIRACLE WHEAT TO GET OUT TO PEOPLE
THAT'S WHAT TRANSFORMS RURAL AREAS
SO WE HAD THIS BOND THAT KEPT US TOGETHER
AND I HAVE USED THE WORLD FOOD PRIZE AND ALL OUR PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE THESE IDEAS
THE UNITED STATES AND IRAN AND I INVITED THEM TO SEND A SCIENTIST TO DES MOINES WHICH THEY DID NOT NEGOTIATING ANYTHING ABOUT NUCLEAR ISSUES
THEY WANTED TO KNOW HOW THEY COULD BUY A COPY OF THAT STATUE OF BORLAUG AND PUT IT UP ON THEIR CAMPUS
WHEN I PASSED THE FOREIGN SERVICE EXAM AND WAS ON MY WAY TO WASHINGTON D C TO
WHAT I EXPERIENCED YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF GLOBAL AGRICULTURE IN THE MID 1960S
AS THEY'RE AT WAR SHOOTING AT EACH OTHER AND CONVINCES BOTH POLITICAL LEADERS TO ADAPT HIS NEW SEEDS HIS APPROACH TO AGRICULTURE AND THE GREEN REVOLUTION IS
BECAUSE IN THE 1860S IT WAS UNDERSTOOD HOW THE TWO WENT TOGETHER AND WHAT IMPACT THEY PRODUCED
AND IN THE MID 1960S
AS INDIA AND PAKISTAN FACED IMMINENT MASS STARVATION FAMINE LIKELY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DEATHS
BORLAUG GOES THERE
FLIES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN
PROBABLY THE GREATEST AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WORLD
HE'S THE MAN OF WHOM
IT IS SAID
HE SAVED A BILLION LIVES
HE HAS SAVED MORE LIVES THAN ANY OTHER PERSON WHO HAS EVER LIVED
AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE GOOD SENSE TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE GREATEST ASSEMBLAGE OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN
UNDER 26 ELIGIBLE FOR THE DRAFT YOU'RE SINGLE YOU'RE MALE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE MILITARY BEFORE I KNEW WHAT HAPPENED THEY ASSIGNED ME TO VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE
NOW THESE DAYS IF THERE'S SUCH CLEAR INDICATION OF MENTAL
IMAGINE I WAS SCARED HERE I'M GOING TO MEET THIS NOBEL PEACE PRIZE LAUREATE AND HE'S GOING TO THINK I'M SOME FANCY PANTS DIPLOMAT
THE NUANCES OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS WITH OTHER DIPLOMATS YOU KNOW BEING FROM DUBUQUE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT AN AP RITIF WAS BUT I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDED
NORMAN BORLAUG AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE THE BEST ANSWER
2013 I WAS INVITED TO ADDRESS THE UNITED NATIONS ON WORLD FOOD DAY I'M TELLING THEM THESE STORIES AND I SAID LOOK AFRICA AND SOUTH ASIA ARE GOING TO BE FACING TWO BILLION ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO BE FED AND
EVERY ONE OF MY COMMANDERS IN AFGHANISTAN SAYS THE SAME THING WHERE THE ROAD ENDS THE INSURGENCY BEGINS
THAT WAS THE LESSON
I HAD LEARNED
I HAD TO GO TO VIETNAM TO LEARN IT BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT AND ALL OF YOU SHOULD KNOW IT BECAUSE IT IS THE LESSON THAT TRANSFORMED AMERICA
THE MIDDLE WEST WHERE I'M FROM
IOWA ILLINOIS INDIANA OHIO
THEY ALL WERE CHANGED BY BUILDING THOSE FARM TO MARKET
MY PHONE RANG IT WAS THE PRIME MINISTER HE WANTED TO TELL ME THAT THE LAST KHMER ROUGE HAD JUST SURRENDERED
NUTRITIOUSLY FEED THE NINE BILLION PEOPLE WHO WILL BE ON OUR PLANET BY THE YEAR 2046 30 YEARS FROM NOW AND CAN WE DO
THAT SUMMER I RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO GO AND ATTEND ANOTHER COMMEMORATIVE CEREMONY FOR HIM FROM THE AGRICULTURAL
WAS GOING TO COME TRUE I WROTE TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND SAID I DON'T WANT TO GO TO HARVARD I DON'T WANT TO STUDY LABOR RELATIONS I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WESTERN EUROPE I WANT TO STAY IN VIETNAM
AND THE AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY IS THE CHEMOTHERAPY THAT YOU SEND TO CONFRONT AND ATTACK AND DESTROY THE TUMOR
AND HE DID THIS BECAUSE AND THE FACT THAT HE'S FROM NORTHEAST IOWA IS NOT BIASING OR PREJUDICING MY COMMENTS
I SAID TAKE THE WORLD HUNGER MAP AND PUT IT UP ON THE WALL AND YOU'LL
NOW THE WORLD FOOD PRIZE AND ALSO AGRICULTURE IS ABOUT PROMOTING PEACE
IN 2012 WE GAVE OUR
250000 PRIZE THAT WE GIVE EACH YEAR TO AN ISRAELI
IRRIGATION SCIENTIST AN ISRAELI JEW
NOW FAST FORWARD TO 2009 I'M NOW MORE SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICER DEALING WITH CAMBODIA CAMBODIA WHICH HAD SUFFERED UNDER THE INCREDIBLE DRACONIAN RULE OF POL POT AND THE KHMER ROUGE
TAKEN THE LIVES OF TWO MILLION OF THE SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY IN JUST FOUR YEARS AND THERE WERE STILL 25 THOUSAND KHMER ROUGE ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE HOW DO WE GET RID OF THEM
ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN AGRICULTURE FARMING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
NOW AT THE SAME TIME BY COINCIDENCE JUST BY CHANCE WE HAD A USAID PROJECT TO UPGRADE THE OLD FRENCH FARM TO MARKET ROAD THAT WENT THROUGH ALL EIGHT VILLAGES
BORLAUG IS PROCLAIMED THE FATHER OF THE GREEN REVOLUTION
WE HAD
ERADICATED
THE WORST GENOCIDAL MASS MURDERING TERRORIST ORGANIZATION OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
USING THAT NORMAN BORLAUG FORMULA
OF ROADS
AND AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY ROADS AND RICE
ROADS AND WHEAT
SOME MODICUM SOME MOMENT OF UNDERSTANDING SO AS WE LOOK AT HOW TO LIFT TWO BILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION
BUT THEY WERE DESPERATE FOR GUYS TO STAY IN VIETNAM SO THEY APPROVED THAT AND I ENDED UP STAYING FOR SIX YEARS AND IT CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE
HAD BEEN NOMINATED FOR OUR PRIZE BY THREE MUSLIM SCIENTISTS
FROM THREE ARAB AND MUSLIM COUNTRIES
THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS CAME TO DES MOINES
TO HELP PRESENT
OUR PRIZE TO
AND SO SEEING THAT I HAD RECEIVED MY ORDERS I WAS GOING TO BE ASSIGNED TO GO TO HARVARD I WAS GOING TO BE TRAINED IN LABOR RELATIONS AND I HAD MY ASSIGNMENT WESTERN
AGRICULTURAL ADVISERS WERE COMING TO MY EIGHT VILLAGES TO ENCOURAGE FARMERS TO USE THE IR8 RICE
A YEAR LATER I'M IN THE BACK OF SINGLE ENGINE PLANE LANDING ON A DIRT ROAD IN THE MEKONG DELTA THEY DIDN'T EVEN STOP THE ENGINE THEY JUST OPENED THE
THE CHALLENGES OF TERRORISM POLITICAL INSTABILITY REFUGEE MIGRATION
11 MILLION DOLLARS OF YOUR TAX PAYER MONEY
AND I USED IT I CALLED IN THE AID OFFICERS AND I SAID GO TO THAILAND
FIND ALL THE ROAD GRADING EQUIPMENT YOU CAN
BRING IT HERE AND START
IMPROVING THE ROADS OUT INTO THESE KHMER ROUGE AREAS
TO NOT NECESSARILY TRADE MY SUITCASE FOR MY BIKE BUT TO FIND A NOVEL WAY OF ALLOWING THE TWO TO LIVE TOGETHER
EVERY MISTAKE
POSSIBLE
IN FACT
BY THE END OF THE YEAR I FOUND MYSELF GOING BACK TO MY MOM'S HOUSE WHILE STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A LEGAL DISPUTE WITH ONE OF MY PARTNERS YES EVERY MISTAKE
POSSIBLE
I WENT HOME QUESTIONING EVERYTHING I'D GOTTEN MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS INTO
I WENT HOME NOT KNOWING WHO I WAS GOING TO BE
BUT WELL AWARE OF EVERYTHING I WAS GIVING UP
FOR A MOMENT IN THE COMFORT OF MY MOM'S HOME
DIDN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO JUST BE MYSELF
TO MAKE SOMETHING FOR X AND SELL IT FOR WHATEVER MULTIPLIER X DESERVES
THOUGH I EVENTUALLY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT I NEEDED TO RAISE THIS COMPANY ON MY OWN
AND THOUGH WE HAD
WOULD LITERALLY SOIL MYSELF {LG} I WOULD SOIL MYSELF DESPITE WANTING TO WRITE THIS BUSINESS 101
I AM
AND WHILE A WROTE A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT MY TRAINING WHERE I WENT AND HOW I FELT
IN THE MIDST OF MY CURRENT DAY DESPAIR THERE WERE A FEW LINES THAT ALMOST SEEMED DIVINE OR PROPHETIC
AND THERE WERE LINES ABOUT WHAT I DRANK
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY I
AWAY WHO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO THINK YOU ARE IF YOU STOP BETTING ON FALSE CURRENCY THE IDENTITY THE STATUS THE
IN A WORLD OF RISK AND REWARD WE'VE BEEN CONDITIONED TO ASK OURSELVES IF THE JUICE IS WORTH THE SQUEEZE IF THE RISK OF GIVING UP WHO YOU ARE
ABOUT WORKING IT'S ABOUT TRYING AND ABOUT DOING IT'S ABOUT TURNING YOUR FRIEND'S DINING ROOM INTO A PACKAGING AND SHIPPING CENTER
ATHLETES WHO I CAN'T NAME
BUT I DON'T HAVE 20 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO BACK THAT UP
MORE TO THE POINT
THE IDEA THAT I MIGHT BE GIVING UP MY ENTIRE WORLD
AN IDENTITY CRAFTED OVER YEARS A HARD EARNED STATUS JUST TO TEST THIS FORMULA SEEMS AN INCREDIBLE RISK AND CHALLENGE
YOU KNOW LIKE ALL GOOD BEDTIME STORIES THIS ONE STARTS WITH ONCE UPON A TIME
AS DAUNTING AS IT MAY BE IT'S ABOUT DOING SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST STEP INTO THE UNKNOWN
OF FREE ENTERPRISE
IN MY DEFENSE
I SPENT THE LAST 20 YEARS OF MY LIFE TRYING TO BE THE BEST PHYSIOLOGIST THE BEST COACH IN THE WORLD
NOT THE BEST BUSINESS PERSON
IF YOU PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD RIGHT NOW AND ASKED ME TO WRITE A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THE TOUR DE FRANCE I'D PULL OUT A SHARPIE AND
I'D WRITE SOMETHING LIKE
DIDN'T KEEP ME FROM BEING SCARED I STARTED RUNNING AROUND TOWN
FORTUNATELY AS PART OF MY JOB WITH PRO CYCLISTS I HAD BEEN
TEN YEARS AGO
A TEAM
OUR CHURCH PASTOR
OUR CHURCH PRESIDENT A COMMUNITY LIAISON
AND SCHOOL PRINCIPAL MET TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THE NEW AMERICAN POPULATION AND HOW WE COULD BETTER SERVE THEM
ONE OF THE IDEAS WAS TO START A COMMUNITY GARDEN AT AN OUTREACH CHURCH
MY FRIEND TOM SAID
UNPROMPTED TEAMS OF GARDENERS ARE SET UP TO ACCOMPLISH THESE TASKS
TEAMWORK BUILDS THE TRUST WHICH IS IMPERATIVE TO BUILD THE COMMUNITY
I CLOSE MY LETTER THAT I WRITE TO THE GARDENERS EACH WEEK
MANY HANDS MAKE LIGHT WORK
MAN FISH FEED HIM FOR A DAY TEACH A MAN TO FISH FEED HIM FOR A
IS THE NUTRITIONAL PART MANY OF THE NEW AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT COME TO AMERICA HAVE A LIMITED INCOME
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE IN THE STORES
THE SECOND IS THE SOCIAL ASPECT
THE NEW AMERICANS COMING TOGETHER
TO MEET WITH THEIR CULTURE AND ALSO WITH THE NEW VOLUNTEERS
OVER 150 FAMILIES
IN 2015 WE HELPED WITH TWO COMMUNITY EVENTS ONE WAS A COMMUNITY MEAL WHICH WE SERVED OVER 500 PEOPLE IN THE PARK USING PRODUCE FROM OUR GARDEN
THE SECOND WAS GARDEN PLANTING DAY WHICH 10 COMMUNITY GARDENS IN FARGO PARTICIPATED ON SPECIAL PROJECTS
RELATIONSHIPS AND GOOD HEALTHY FOOD SO THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE CREATED GROWING TOGETHER A COMMUNITY GARDEN MINISTRY
THOSE GARDEN GATES EMPOWERING NOT ENABLING EACH PARTICIPANT IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND NEW AMERICANS EVERYONE IS ON EQUAL FOOTING AND EVERYONE SHARES THE FRUITS OF OUR COLLECTIVE LABOR
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU IS A MILLIONAIRE OR ON ASSISTANCE IN THE GARDEN WE ARE ON EQUAL FOOTING
THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND FRIENDSHIP IS UNMISTAKABLE WHEN YOU ENTER THE GARDEN
OLD FRIENDS NEW FRIENDS
LAUGHING
GREETING EACH OTHER
AND SHARING
THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS ARISEN FROM GROWING TOGETHER NOW EXTENDS BEYOND THE GARDEN GATES
INTEGRATION IS WHEN TWO
I
WAS ABOUT
36 I HAD JUST GOTTEN THROUGH A VERY BAD YEAR
I D GOTTEN A DIVORCE I NBSP HAD NO MONEY I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY I HAD TWO VERY SMALL CHILDREN
I COULDN T GET A DAY CARE CENTER SO I COULDN T TAKE A JOB WE STAYED IN WELFARE HOTELS IN NEW YORK THAT S WORTH WRITING NOVEL

THAT S NOT SO OLD I MIGHT LIVE A WHILE I M GOING TO SEE
OH BOY NOTHING {LG} HERE S NBSP THE PUNCHLINE ISOLATION IS THE DREAM NBSP KILLER
OTHER HAND VOLUNTEERS FILL IN MANY GAPS LEFT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS
MEETING THEIR SOCIAL NEEDS AND DELIVERING PROBLEMS LIKE
HUMAN RIGHTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND MANY OTHER ISSUES
ALTHOUGH VOLUNTEERING MAKES AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE
SADLY IN MONGOLIA
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE ANY OFFICIAL STUDIES ON VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTION
I JOINED DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS FOR EXAMPLE A LOCAL VOLUNTEER GROUP PROMOTING FAIR TRADE I MET SO MANY AMAZING PEOPLE
SO MANY MONGOLIANS WHO ARE THE FUTURE OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY THANKS TO VOLUNTEERING I AM THE PERSON I HAVE NEVER DREAMED I WOULD BE THANK YOU
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF
EVERYTHING CHANGED AFTER I ENTERED UNIVERSITY AND STARTED STUDYING INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
I WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE ONLY NINETEEN YEARS OLD BUT THEY WERE SO OPEN
TRAVELED AND EXPERIENCED AND INVOLVED IN SO MANY ACTIVITIES FROM HELPING A LOCAL MUSEUM TO ORGANIZING AN EXHIBITION TO SPENDING TIME WITH KIDS IN A HOSPITAL
I REALISED THAT I CAN DO
I HAD QUITE A CULTURE SHOCK LET ME TELL YOU BANGLADESH IS A MUSLIM COUNTRY IT IS OVERCROWDED AND VERY FEW PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AS A
IN BOTH SENSES OF THE WORD NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE DEEP POVERTY AND ENORMOUS WEALTH LIVE LITERALLY NEXT TO EACH OTHER THERE A
THEN YOU ACT ON IT
FOR EXAMPLE
LOCAL SCHOOLS ARE ALWAYS IN NEED OF SOMETHING
YOU CAN HELP RUNNING AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS
OR YOU CAN HELP DURING TEA TIME IN THE PRIMARY CLASSES
OR YOU CAN EVEN ORGANIZE FUNDRAISING EVENTS AT YOUR LOCAL SCHOOLS
AND SO ON
NOT ALWAYS WILL YOUR VOLUNTEER WORK REACH THE DESIRED RESULT
BUT YOU ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING FROM
I WAS ACTUALLY CAPABLE OF DOING SOMETHING FOR THEM
I LEARNT THE HARD WAY THAT MANY TIMES AS A VOLUNTEER YOU CAN'T START YOUR WORK LET ALONE SEE THE RESULTS RIGHT AWAY
OFTEN AS A VOLUNTEER YOU NEED TO BE REALLY PATIENT AND DETERMINED
EVEN THOUGH
ONE INTERESTING FACT IS THAT
THE FIRST STUDY ON VOLUNTEERISM IN MONGOLIA HELD IN 2001 SHOWS THAT 85 OF THOSE
INTERVIEWED IN THIS RESEARCH VOLUNTEERED BECAUSE OF THE SELF DEVELOPMENT
AND NEW SKILLS
LIKE MYSELF
THE FIRST TIME I SEARCHED FOR A VOLUNTEER JOB MY INTENTIONS WERE GAINING NEW SKILLS
AND TO HAVE SOME WORK EXPERIENCE ON MY CV TO LOOK GOOD
AT THAT TIME I DID NOT TRULY
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF VOLUNTEERISM
SERVING AS A VOLUNTEER
ALSO GIVES YOU THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND CULTURAL DIFFERENCE
AT SOME STAGE OF MY VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE I HAVE HEARD MANY PEOPLE SAYING MONGOLIANS
DO NOT REALLY APPRECIATE OR UNDERSTAND VOLUNTEER WORK
WELL IT IS JUST SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO SEE PEOPLE'S FEELINGS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE LIKE
US WHO
ARE NOT VERY EMOTIONAL AND SHOW LESS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
HOWEVER OUR SOCIETY ALWAYS BEING DEVELOPED AND SURVIVED BASED ON THE UNWRITTEN TRADITION OF MUTUAL HEALTH OR SUPPORT TO EACH
THE UNIVERSE
WELL ABOUT
30 YEARS AGO I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE GIVEN YOU THIS ANSWER
I WAS
23 I STARTED TO TRAIN COMPANIES INDIVIDUALS GROUPS
NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS
YOU TRY SOMETHING ELSE
YOU ARE IN SOME KIND OF GROUP THAT HAS TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT
AND YOU KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE ROAD YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE JUDGED BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT YOUR MAIN KPIS YOU FEEL
ACKNOWLEDGED ALL THE TIME YOU WANT THE PERSONAL RECOGNITION OF YOUR CO WORKERS YOU WANT THE PERSONAL RECOGNITION OF THAT DIRECT
THEIR ADVICE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OF OTHERS AND
ACTUALLY IT ISN'T
WE WANT RECOGNITION FROM PEOPLE WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH
NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WAS
RELATIONSHIP OCCURS WHEN YOU START TRUSTING SOMEONE
AND YOU START TO TELL THIS PERSON MORE ABOUT YOURSELF AND IN THE END
YOU TELL MORE ABOUT YOURSELF TO THAT PERSON THAN YOU TELL TO OTHER PEOPLE
THE MORE YOU TRUST SOMEONE THE MORE YOU TELL THAT PERSON
THAT SOMEBODY IS WATCHING US THOSE ORGANIZATIONS SPOKE AT THE BEGINNING THAT WERE DOING SO WELL ARE USUALLY THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LOT OF MIDDLE MANAGEMENT THAT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR
ENOUGH THE TOP OF THE ORGANIZATION AND IT ALSO CAN BE A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY THINKS THAT THEY ARE WINNING BECAUSE HEY WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE CUSTOMER
AND
THIS WAS NOT A NICE IDEA BECAUSE I LIKED
ALL THE STUFF THAT HAD TO DO WITH FIRING UP PEOPLE MAKING THEM ENTHUSIASTIC FINDING YOUR INNER SOURCES INTRINSIC MOTIVATION
UNFORTUNATELY
WE CANNOT GET PAST THAT FOURTH LAYER OF MASLOW'S PYRAMID AND 95 OF OUR LIVES WE ARE SEEKING PERSONAL RECOGNITION
THE FUNNY THING IS THEIR RECOGNITION IS WORTH TO YOU MORE SO THE PROCESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP
IN WORK OR ACTIVITIES WE TRY TO REALIZE WE ACTUALLY DO NOT WANT COMPLIMENTS EITHER
DO WE SHY AWAY FROM THIS WHOLE PRINCIPLE THAT WE WANT PERSONAL RECOGNITION
TO YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU SIT TOGETHER AND GIVE EACH OTHER COMPLIMENTS ACTUALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU GIVE MUCH MORE
TRUST PEOPLE YOU TELL THEM MORE THE MORE YOU TOLD THEM THE MORE YOU TRUST THEM
COMPLIMENT FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY VERY EASY TO DO BECAUSE THAT MOMENT YOU DON'T SEE THE COMPLIMENT AS PERSONAL RECOGNITION
HERE IS MY DEFINITION PERSONAL RECOGNITION IS TO BE SEEN AND TO BE ACCEPTED FOR WHO YOU ARE
AMERICANS AND UNDER THIS VERY THIN VENEER OF THIS IS OUR CULTURE
OF THE CLIENT MEANS MORE TO THEM SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PROFIT
FUNNY AS YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND A WIKIPEDIA PAGE DEDICATED TO THIS SUBJECT
IT'S A DISASTER THAT WE ACTUALLY CANNOT IDENTIFY THINGS GO WRONG FOR OTHER REASONS SO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT
IT'S VERY HARD TO LOOK AT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
THEREFORE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO GET YOUR OWN NEED FULFILLED FOR
THE PERSONAL RECOGNITION THAT YOU WANT
THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU DON'T SEE THE NEEDS IN OTHERS EITHER AND THEN IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE
WANT YOUR RECOGNITION
THIS IS WHERE WE START TO FAIL ACTUALLY WE SEE VERY LITTLE ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY NON PROFIT
WHERE WE TRY TO FEED PEOPLE THE IDEAL OF THE COMPANY
YOU SHOULD DO YOUR BEST OR YOU SHOULD WORK YOUR ASS OFF FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON WE HAVE AN IDEAL
OF COURSE WE LIKE IT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE NEED IT THEY EAT US UP THAT'S ACTUALLY THEIR JOB YOU
{NS} SO WHAT IS THE BIGGEST DRIVER THAT YOU HAVE DURING YOUR LIFE TIME IS IT
OF THE COMPANY BEFORE THEY EVEN START TO DO TRAINING OR WHATEVER
AS MUCH AS WE CAN DO WE LIKE IT WHEN WE GET THEIR
SO MIND YOU PERSONAL RECOGNITION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COMPLIMENTS AND THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE AT FIRST BUT HOW MANY TIMES DO
FOR POSITIONS AND HOW
WHERE WE WORK WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CANNOT GET THE RECOGNITION THAT WE WANT
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE TRY TO GET RECOGNITION PERSONAL RECOGNITION FROM OTHER SOURCES IT'S THE BASIC NEEDS WE CAN'T FUNCTION WITHOUT IT IT'S LIKE WATER
WHEN YOU WALKED IN
YET
THEY FAILED
IT TOOK ME SOME MORE YEARS AND LOT OF HAIR THAT FLASHED DOWN THE DRAIN OF MY SHOWER
TO ACTUALLY PUT MY FINGER ON IT
IT WAS PERSONAL RECOGNITION
ACTUALLY WE THRIVE WE ALWAYS FEEL THAT WHATEVER WE DO OR WHATEVER RISKS WE TAKE OR WHATEVER SIDE WAY WE TAKE FROM THE KPI MACHINE OR FROM WHAT THE
ACTUALLY EVERYBODY IN HIS LIFE HAS EXPERIENCED THE FEELING OF CASTRATION SOMETIMES WHEN A BOSS OR SOMEONE HAS TO RATE YOU
YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE THAT GO TO THE CLIENTS AND THEY HAVE BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CLIENTS THAN WITH THEIR OWN
OF WHO WE COME FROM OF THIS COUNTRY THERE IS THIS NEED FOR PERSONAL RECOGNITION
SO NO THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CULTURE
ACTUALLY
FUNNILY ENOUGH
GERMANS SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THIS THING MUCH BETTER
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION WHERE WE GET RECOGNITION
IS IMPORTANT LET ME GIVE YOU THE WHOLE THING AGAIN
PERSONAL RECOGNITION IS TO BE SEEN AND TO BE ACCEPTED FOR WHO YOU REALLY ARE
AND TO GET CREDIT AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM SOMEBODY THAT YOU REALLY WANT IT FROM
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WE WANT IT FROM
THAT WAS A DIFFICULT ONE TOO
AT FIRST I THOUGHT BOSSES AND ALSO
SOME ORGANIZATIONS FAILED
MISERABLY AND SOME ORGANIZATIONS SUCCEEDED
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY FAILED
SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS WAS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR
I COULDN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT
BUT LOOKING AT THE COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY
SUCCEEDED
THERE WAS ALWAYS THE SITUATION THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO WORK FOR SOMEONE
THE GROUP THEY WERE IN BUT ESPECIALLY THEIR LEADER LET'S CALL IT SERGEANT
THAT'S DIFFICULT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SOME PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES WE SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON THE RECOGNITION WE'D LIKE TO GET IT BUT IF YOU GET DEPENDENT ON IT THE TROUBLE STARTS
AND THE FIRST PLACE WE WENT TO I WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE FROM UPTOWN WHO COULD SURVIVE DOWN THERE
I DON'T SEE HOW CHEERLEADING IS GOING TO HELP MY COMMUNITY MY COMMUNITY WAS AT WAR AND
WE DO {NS} I CHEER THE GIRLS I COACH THEM SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY CAN COMPETE AND THEN WE CELEBRATE WHAT THEY DO CORRECT EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING
HOME BECAUSE I GREW UP IN HUNTER I SAW THE ROCKY HORROR SHOW DOWN THERE
OR WITH EACH OTHER ON THIS PLANET ACTUALLY WE'RE RATHER BUSY SEEMINGLY DESTROYING THE ONLY HOME THAT WE HAVE WE'RE
ME THE ULTIMATE FREEDOM THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE
THAT WE OFTEN WILL FORGET THAT WE'RE DOING IT AND WE MIGHT FORGET WHAT WAS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MIGHT THINK THAT OUR IDEAS ARE REALITY AND THEY
ABSTRACTION THIS PROCESS HERE I USE ABSTRACTION
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU VIKTOR FRANKL WAS A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR HE WAS IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP DURING THE SECOND
START ACTING MORE INTELLIGENTLY TOGETHER WHERE
WORLD
BUT THE MOMENT THAT
YOU FORGET THAT THEY'RE JUST MAPS THEN YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET LOST YOUR GPS WILL NOT ALWAYS BRING YOU TO THE RIGHT PLACE
BUT IT'S THIS ABILITY TO THINK ABSTRACTLY AND TO MAKE MAPS OF THE WORLD
THAT HAS MADE US
WE COULD SAY THAT WORDS ARE LIKE POINTERS THAT POINT TO SOMETHING IF I TALK ABOUT THE
WE ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO CHOOSE WHAT IT MEANS
WHICH THEN WILL INFLUENCE HOW WE WILL RESPOND HOW WE'LL ACT AND HOW WE WILL THEN FEEL ABOUT THAT
AND YOUR LIFE IS MOSTLY THE RESULT OF HOW YOU'VE RESPONDED AND HOW YOU'VE ACTED
SO WE CAN BE AWARE OF IT AND WHAT ELSE WELL WE CAN REALIZE
EXAMINE THE WORLD AROUND US WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT GATHER KNOWLEDGE
WE USE THIS FOR COMMUNICATING TO EACH OTHER TO
TEACH AND TO DISCUSS WHAT REALLY IS THERE AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
AND THIS IS ALSO WHAT ALLOWS US TO CREATE TECHNOLOGY WHICH ALLOWS US TO INFLUENCE AND
A SPACE THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU ARE AWARE OF BOTH WHAT YOU'RE PERCEIVING FROM THE WORLD AND YOU'RE AWARE
HIT RECEPTORS IN MY EYES AND NERVE SIGNALS WILL SEND THEM TO MY BRAIN AND MY BRAIN WILL TRY TO CONSTRUCT OBJECTS OF WHAT SUPPOSEDLY AM SEEING
IT'S NEVER JUST BLACK AND WHITE LIFE IS COMPLEX
WILL END UP BEING THE RIGHT ONES BUT EVEN IF WE DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND THE ULTIMATE NATURE OF
FORCED TO DO HARD PHYSICAL LABOR EVERYDAY AND YET HE CREATED SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE FROM THAT
PLANET IN A VERY LARGE UNIVERSE BUT WE CARE A LOT ABOUT THIS PLANET BECAUSE IT'S FRANKLY THE ONLY ONE THAT WE HAVE
OF FIXED NEGATIVE CONCLUSIONS THAT WE'VE MADE ABOUT EACH OTHER AND WE DON'T REALLY WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER IF WE'RE ALL REACTING
WE TAKE THINGS LITERALLY AS IF THEY'RE EXACTLY LIKE WE SAY THEY ARE OR LIKE THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE
WE OVERSIMPLIFY THINGS AND THEN WE ACT ON THOSE OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS
SO A LOT OF OUR PROBLEMS COME FROM THAT BUT HOW CAN WE START MOVING BEYOND THAT
WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT PAYING ATTENTION A LOT OF US DON'T WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT LISTENING TO
{NS} {NS} IN OUR RESPONSE LIES OUR GROWTH AND OUR FREEDOM
ACCESS THE MORE SILENT LEVEL OF OUR AWARENESS
BEYOND OUR OWN BELIEF SYSTEMS AND WE CAN DEAL A LITTLE MORE WITH WHAT ACTUALLY IS THERE TOGETHER OUT BEYOND IDEAS OF RIGHT DOING
AND YOUR MOTHER IN LAW IS COMING VISITING TOMORROW IT
CHOOSE WHAT IT MEANS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
THIS IS A SCREEN I CAN TALK ABOUT IT WE
SOME OF US ARE DOING VERY WELL 85 INDIVIDUALS OWN AS MUCH
I SLEPT A LOT TWO HOURS OF CHEMISTRY CLASS IN A LANGUAGE THAT YOU DON'T YET FULLY UNDERSTAND CAN BE A PRETTY GOOD SEDATIVE {LG}
TOGETHER TO THE CHRISTMAS DANCE WAS A PUBLIC CONFIRMATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP AND I FELT LIKE THE LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
YOUR SILENCE IS NEVER EASY AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD IT CAN EVEN BE DEADLY TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT RAPE
I REALIZE THAT EVEN THE MOST TRAUMATIC EVENT OF MY LIFE IS STILL A TESTAMENT TO MY PRIVILEGE BECAUSE I CAN TALK ABOUT IT WITHOUT GETTING OSTRACIZED OR EVEN KILLED
TE WHAT WE DID IS NOT A FORMULA THAT WE'RE PRESCRIBING FOR OTHERS
WAS THAT I NEEDED TO BE CONSTANTLY FIDGETING BECAUSE IN MOMENTS OF STILLNESS I FOUND MYSELF COUNTING SECONDS AGAIN BUT THAT DAY I WATCHED IN WONDER AS THE WORDS STREAMED OUT OF MY PEN
MY SMILE IT WASN'T MY CHILDISH TRUST THE ONLY THING THAT COULD'VE STOPPED ME FROM BEING RAPED THAT NIGHT IS THE MAN WHO RAPED ME HAD HE STOPPED
THE POWER OF WORDS SAYING TO THORDIS THAT I RAPED HER CHANGED MY ACCORD WITH MYSELF AS WELL AS WITH HER
TREATING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AS A WOMEN'S ISSUE
THE THINGS THAT I FOUND USEFUL ON MY OWN HEALING JOURNEY IS EDUCATING MYSELF ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND AS A RESULT I'VE BEEN READING WRITING AND SPEAKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR OVER A DECADE NOW GOING TO CONFERENCES AROUND THE
A MAJORITY OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND MEN IS PERPETRATED BY MEN AND
I STARTED WRITING FEVERISHLY UPON MY RETURN FROM CAPE TOWN RESULTING IN A BOOK CO AUTHORED BY TOM THAT
SO I TOLD MYSELF IT WAS POINTLESS TO ADDRESS WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND BESIDES IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN MY FAULT SOMEHOW I
WAS RAISED IN A WORLD WHERE GIRLS ARE TAUGHT THAT THEY GET RAPED FOR A REASON
THEIR SKIRT WAS TOO SHORT
THEIR SMILE WAS TOO WIDE THEIR BREATH SMELLED OF
AND LIKEWISE ONCE SOMEONE HAS BEEN BRANDED A RAPIST IT'S THAT MUCH EASIER TO CALL HIM A MONSTER
INHUMAN
BUT HOW WILL WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS IN HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT PRODUCES VIOLENCE IF WE REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE THE HUMANITY OF THOSE WHO COMMIT IT
AND HOW
ONE DAY I STORMED OUT OF THE DOOR IN TEARS AFTER A FIGHT WITH A LOVED ONE
AND I WANDERED INTO A CAF WHERE I ASKED THE WAITRESS FOR A PEN
I ALWAYS HAD A NOTEBOOK WITH ME CLAIMING THAT IT WAS TO JOT DOWN IDEAS IN MOMENTS OF INSPIRATION
BUT THE
AND HOW CAN WE EMPOWER SURVIVORS IF WE'RE MAKING THEM FEEL LESS THAN HOW CAN WE DISCUSS SOLUTIONS TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD
DOWN TO IT WE DID OUT BEST TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER INTENTLY AND OUR INDIVIDUAL REALITIES WERE AIRED WITH AN
EXAMPLES OF EQUITABLE BEHAVIOR AROUND ME BUT ON THAT OCCASION I CHOSE TO DRAW UPON THE NEGATIVE ONES THE ONES THAT SEE WOMEN AS HAVING LESS INTRINSIC WORTH AND OF MEN HAVING SOME UNSPOKEN AND SYMBOLIC CLAIM TO THEIR
MY ACTIONS THAT NIGHT IN 1996 WERE A SELF CENTERED TAKING I FELT DESERVING OF THORDIS'S BODY I'VE HAD PRIMARILY POSITIVE SOCIAL
CAN BE OF USE TO PEOPLE FROM BOTH ENDS OF THE PERPETRATOR SURVIVOR SCALE
WHEN I WAS TEENAGER I WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO KNOW THAT THE SHAME WASN'T MINE THAT THERE'S HOPE AFTER RAPE THAT YOU CAN EVEN FIND HAPPINESS LIKE I SHARE WITH MY HUSBAND TODAY
WE'D BEEN IN A BUDDING RELATIONSHIP FOR BIT OVER MONTH WHEN OUR SCHOOL'S CHRISTMAS BALL WAS HELD
THEIR VOICES ARE SORELY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT ALL OF
TS I HAVE VAGUE MEMORIES OF THE NEXT DAY
THE AFTER EFFECTS OF DRINKING A
CERTAIN HOLLOWNESS THAT I TRIED TO STIFLE
NOTHING MORE
BUT I DIDN'T SHOW UP AT THORDIS'S DOOR IT
IS IMPORTANT TO NOW STATE THAT I DIDN'T SEE MY DEED FOR WHAT IT
DEEP DOWN I KNEW I'D DONE SOMETHING IMMEASURABLY WRONG BUT WITHOUT PLANNING IT I SUNK THE MEMORIES DEEP AND THEN I TIED A ROCK TO THEM
NOBODY MORE THAN MYSELF
BUT DEEP DOWN I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS MY WAY OUT OF MY SUFFERING
BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT HE DESERVED MY FORGIVENESS I DESERVED PEACE
MY ERA OF SHAME
WAS OVER
AND THIS IS A LIE I'VE FELT SPINE BENDING GUILT FOR I BROKE UP WITH THORDIS A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER AND THEN SAW HER A NUMBER OF TIMES DURING THE REMAINDER OF MY YEAR IN ICELAND FEELING A SHARP STAB OF HEAVYHEARTEDNESS EACH TIME
LIKE ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF REALITY WAS FORBIDDEN MY DEFINITION OF MY ACTIONS COMPLETELY REFUTED ANY RECOGNITION OF THE IMMENSE TRAUMA I CAUSED
SELF PITY WAS STARVED OF OXYGEN AND IT WAS REPLACED WITH THE CLEAN AIR OF ACCEPTANCE AN ACCEPTANCE THAT I DID HURT THIS WONDERFUL PERSON STANDING NEXT TO ME
WITH THIS NOISE I ALSO DREW HEAVILY UPON OTHER PARTS OF MY LIFE TO CONSTRUCT A PICTURE OF WHO I WAS I WAS A SURFER A SOCIAL SCIENCE STUDENT A FRIEND TO GOOD PEOPLE A LOVED BROTHER AND SON
AS HE PROCEEDED TO TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES AND GET ON TOP OF ME MY HEAD HAD CLEARED UP BUT MY BODY WAS STILL TOO WEAK TO FIGHT BACK AND THE PAIN WAS BLINDING I THOUGHT I'D BE SEVERED IN TWO
HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL ANYONE ELSE HOW TO HANDLE THEIR DEEPEST PAIN OR THEIR GREATEST ERROR
PARTIES AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE TRUTH THERE'S DEFINITELY A PUBLIC CONVERSATION HAPPENING NOW AND LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE
I RELIEVED MYSELF OF THE BURDENS THAT I'D WRONGFULLY SHOULDERED AND HE IN TURN WHOLEHEARTEDLY OWNED UP TO WHAT HE'D DONE OUR WRITTEN EXCHANGES BECAME A PLATFORM TO DISSECT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT NIGHT AND THEY WERE EVERYTHING
THE LEAST I OWE MY FELLOW SURVIVORS
WHO CAN'T
THE STORY WE'VE JUST RELAYED IS UNIQUE AND YET IT IS SO COMMON WITH SEXUAL VIOLENCE BEING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY
ALOUD AND FELT FACE TO FACE AT OTHER TIMES THOUGH WE FOUND A SOARING CLARITY AND EVEN SOME TOTALLY UNEXPECTED BUT LIBERATING LAUGHTER
THAT WAS A BAD IDEA I BECAME VERY ILL DRIFTING IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN BETWEEN SPASMS OF CONVULSIVE VOMITING THE SECURITY GUARDS WANTED TO CALL ME AN AMBULANCE BUT TOM ACTED AS MY KNIGHT IN SHINING
AND SHOCKINGLY EVERYDAY GROUPING OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY VIOLENT
GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR STORY I KNOW THE WORDS THAT INEVITABLY ACCOMPANY IT VICTIM RAPIST AND LABELS ARE A WAY TO ORGANIZE CONCEPTS BUT
SURE I'D BE STANDING HERE TODAY THAT ISN'T TO SAY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE MY DOUBTS ALONG THE WAY WHEN THE PLANE BOUNCED ON THAT LANDING STRIP IN CAPE TOWN I REMEMBER THINKING
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BLAME TRANSFERRED FROM THORDIS TO ME FAR TOO OFTEN THE RESPONSIBILITY IS ATTRIBUTED TO FEMALE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND NOT TO THE MALES WHO ENACT
EVEN AND ALL I WANTED TO DO FOR YEARS WAS TO HURT TOM BACK AS DEEPLY AS HE HAD HURT ME BUT HAD I NOT FOUND A WAY OUT OF THE HATRED AND ANGER
ALSO BE DEHUMANIZING IN THEIR CONNOTATIONS ONCE SOMEONE'S BEEN DEEMED A VICTIM IT'S THAT MUCH EASIER TO FILE THEM AWAY AS SOMEONE DAMAGED DISHONORED LESS THAN
BUCKLE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY I THOUGHT MY CERTIFICATE OF HUMANITY WOULD BE BURNT INSTEAD I WAS OFFERED TO REALLY OWN WHAT I DID
THE MOST PIVOTAL LETTER I'VE EVER WRITTEN ADDRESSED TO TOM ALONG WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE VIOLENCE THAT HE SUBJECTED ME TO THE WORDS I WANT TO FIND FORGIVENESS STARED BACK AT ME
IT WAS ONLY ME IN THAT ROOM MAKING CHOICES NOBODY
THE EFFECT THAT CAPE TOWN HAD ON US OVER THE COURSE OF THIS WEEK WE LITERALLY SPOKE OUR LIFE STORIES TO EACH OTHER FROM START TO
I'M AN AUSTRALIAN WHO PREFERS PROPER ICY COLD WEATHER SO WAS BOTH EXCITED AND TEARFUL WHEN I GOT ON A PLANE TO ICELAND AFTER JUST HAVING FAREWELLED MY PARENTS AND BROTHERS
THAT LIGHT HAD TRIUMPHED OVER DARKNESS THAT SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE COULD BE BUILT OUT OF THE RUINS I READ SOMEWHERE THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND BE THE PERSON THAT YOU NEEDED WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER
AND THIS MARKED THE START OF AN EIGHT YEAR LONG CORRESPONDENCE THAT GOD KNOWS WAS NEVER EASY BUT ALWAYS HONEST
THE CITY ITSELF PROVED TO BE A STUNNINGLY POWERFUL ENVIRONMENT TO FOCUS ON RECONCILIATION AND FORGIVENESS NOWHERE ELSE HAS HEALING AND RAPPROCHEMENT BEEN TESTED LIKE IT HAS IN SOUTH AFRICA
THE ENTIRE ACT IN THE DAYS AFTERWARDS AND WHEN I WAS COMMITTING IT I DISAVOWED THE TRUTH BY CONVINCING MYSELF IT WAS SEX AND NOT
DID I NOT JUST GET MYSELF A THERAPIST AND A BOTTLE OF VODKA LIKE A NORMAL PERSON WOULD DO
AT TIMES OUR SEARCH FOR UNDERSTANDING IN CAPE TOWN FELT LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE QUEST AND ALL I WANTED TO DO
AND FOUND THAT IT DIDN'T POSSESS THE ENTIRETY OF WHO I AM PUT SIMPLY SOMETHING YOU'VE DONE DOESN'T HAVE TO CONSTITUTE THE SUM OF WHO YOU ARE THE NOISE IN MY HEAD ABATED
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO BE BRAVE WHEN YOU'RE HIDING BEHIND A COMPUTER SCREEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET BUT WE'D BEGUN A DIALOGUE THAT I FELT WAS NECESSARY TO EXPLORE TO ITS FULLEST
EIGHT YEARS OF WRITING AND NEARLY 16 YEARS AFTER THAT DIRE NIGHT I MUSTERED THE COURAGE TO PROPOSE A WILD IDEA THAT WE'D MEET UP IN PERSON AND FACE OUR PAST ONCE AND FOR
OLD DOWNTOWN REYKJAV K I MET HER WELCOMING FAMILY AND SHE MET MY FRIENDS
TE NINE YEARS AFTER THE CHRISTMAS DANCE I WAS 25 YEARS OLD AND HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN
MY SELF WORTH WAS BURIED UNDER A SOUL CRUSHING LOAD OF SILENCE THAT ISOLATED ME FROM EVERYONE THAT I CARED ABOUT
AND I WAS CONSUMED WITH MISPLACED HATRED AND ANGER THAT I TOOK OUT ON MYSELF
WHAT FOLLOWED IS A NINE YEAR PERIOD THAT CAN BEST BE TITLED AS DENIAL AND RUNNING WHEN I GOT A CHANCE TO IDENTIFY THE REAL TORMENT THAT I CAUSED I DIDN'T STAND STILL LONG ENOUGH TO DO
AND THIS WAS ABOUT ANALYZING OUR OWN HISTORY
WE FOLLOWED A STRICT POLICY OF BEING HONEST AND
THIS ALSO CAME WITH A CERTAIN EXPOSURE
AN OPEN CHESTED VULNERABILITY
THERE WERE GUTTING CONFESSIONS
AND MOMENTS WHERE WE JUST
ABSOLUTELY COULDN'T FATHOM THE OTHER PERSON'S
ELSE IT'S A STORY THAT WE WOULD'VE NEEDED TO HEAR WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER
WRENCHING TO HEALING BEYOND WORDS AND YET IT DIDN'T BRING ABOUT CLOSURE FOR ME PERHAPS BECAUSE THE EMAIL FORMAT DIDN'T FEEL PERSONAL ENOUGH
AND GO HOME TO MY LOVING HUSBAND VIDIR AND OUR SON BUT DESPITE OUR DIFFICULTIES THIS JOURNEY DID RESULT IN VICTORIOUS
THE ONLY OUTCOME THAT I DIDN'T PREPARE MYSELF FOR WAS THE ONE THAT I THEN GOT A TYPED CONFESSION FROM TOM FULL OF DISARMING REGRET AS IT TURNS OUT HE TOO HAD BEEN IMPRISONED BY
AN OUTDOOR RECREATION GUIDE AND EVENTUALLY A YOUTH WORKER
I GRIPPED TIGHT TO THE SIMPLE NOTION THAT I WASN'T A BAD PERSON
I DIDN'T THINK I HAD THIS IN MY BONES
THOUGHT WAS MADE UP OF SOMETHING ELSE
IN MY NURTURED UPBRINGING
MY LOVING EXTENDED FAMILY AND ROLE MODELS
PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME WERE WARM AND GENUINE IN THEIR RESPECT SHOWN TOWARDS WOMEN IT
TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO STARE DOWN THIS DARK CORNER OF MYSELF
AND TO ASK IT QUESTIONS
DESPITE LIMPING FOR DAYS AND CRYING FOR WEEKS THIS INCIDENT DIDN'T FIT MY IDEAS ABOUT RAPE LIKE I'D SEEN ON TV TOM WASN'T AN ARMED LUNATIC HE WAS MY BOYFRIEND
RECOMMENDED I TRY OUT FOR THE SCHOOL PLAY JUST TO GET ME A BIT MORE SOCIALLY ACTIVE IT TURNS OUT I DIDN'T END UP BEING PART OF THE PLAY BUT THROUGH IT I MET
ICELAND AND AUSTRALIA ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY LIKE THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWO IS SOUTH AFRICA WE DECIDED UPON THE CITY OF CAPE TOWN AND THERE WE MET FOR ONE
THE NEIGHBORHOODS THEY USED TO BIKE AROUND AS A KID THE YARDS THEY USED TO BUILD SNOWMEN ON AND I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE IT GOING FROM THIS
KNOWING THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE FOR HIM
EXCEPT EASE HIS PAIN
AND THEN HAVING TO WATCH AND ENDURE THE PAIN OF A MOTHER
AS SHE SITS THERE WITH HER CHILD IN HER ARMS
AS HE PASSES AWAY IN
HER LAP
FURTHERMORE THIS MEANS THERE ARE OVER 2 MILLION CHILDREN
WHO HAVE BEEN WITHOUT EDUCATION FOR 4 YEARS
THE SAME EDUCATION THAT YOU AND I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH
THIS UNIVERSITY THAT HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO ATTEND
I WANT YOU TO THINK BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE 5 YEARS AGO
IMAGINE IF YOUR LIFE HAD TAKEN A LEFT TURN
I WAS A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL 15 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME
I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY
LET ALONE HAVE MY HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA
I WOULD BE WITH MY YOUNGER SIBLINGS
LIVING THE MONOTONY OF A REFUGEE CAMP
OR WANDERING THE STREETS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY
PRONE AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO CRIME AND FORCED LABOR
AND THE CALL TO TERRORISM
FURTHERMORE
I ASK YOU A QUESTION
HOW ARE THESE KIDS GOING TO DEVELOP THE CAPACITY AND THE SKILLSET TO BECOME CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF THEIR SOCIETY
HOPEFULLY WHEN THE SYRIAN CONFLICT IS OVER ONE DAY
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GO BACK AND REBUILD THIS COUNTRY
BUGS TO INSECTS TO VEGETATION AROUND THEM TO THE POINT WHERE YOU STAND THERE
AND YOU LOOK AROUND YOU
AND THERE IS NO GRASS TO BE SEEN
THIS IS THE STATE OF DEPRAVITY
A VACUUM THAT HAS LED TO THE RISE OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ISIS
WHO FEED ON PEOPLE'S FEARS AND BITTERNESS
AND THEIR LOST SENSE OF HOPE AND PURPOSE ATTEMPTING TO CONVINCE THEM
OF A CONVOLUTED HIGHER PURPOSE IN LIFE
UNFORTUNATELY THE FEAR MONGERING OF THE MEDIA ONLY PERPETUATES THIS VICIOUS CYCLE
LABELING REFUGEES AS POISON TO OUR SOCIETIES BOUND TO ONLY BRING OUR LIVES HARM
SENDING THEM BACK
TO WHAT'S LEFT OF THEIR COUNTRY
SYSTEMIC TARGETED BOMBINGS OF HOSPITALS
AND SCHOOLS AND MOSQUES AND CHURCHES HAS LEFT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WITH TWO OPTIONS
EITHER FLEE
OR BE KILLED
4 7 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN THE FORMER
ESCAPING WITH ONLY THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK
ONE FOURTH OF SYRIA'S ORIGINAL POPULATION OF 23 MILLION
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE UN ESTIMATES THAT OVER HALF OF THE SYRIAN REFUGEE POPULATION IS UNDER THE AGE OF 18
THAT IS OVER 2 MILLION CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS WHO HAVE BEEN WITHOUT HOMES FOR 5 YEARS
WHO HAVE UNDERGONE EXTREME PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORMENT THAT SCARS THEM INDEFINITELY
IN THE PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT CLINICS I WORKED WITH
I AM VERY HUMBLED AND BLESSED TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY
TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT NEVER STRAYS FAR FROM MIND ONE THAT IS CONSTANTLY ON MY THOUGHTS
AN ISSUE THAT OVERWHELMS MY EMOTIONS AT TIMES
I AM EXTREMELY PROUD TO CALL MYSELF A SYRIAN MUSLIM AMERICAN
MY PARENTS LIVED IN SYRIA UP UNTIL THEY GOT MARRIED AND CAME HERE TO PURSUE THEIR GRADUATE STUDIES
AS A CHILD MY BROTHER AND I WOULD VISIT EVERY SUMMER
TO SEE EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS AND TO EXPLORE OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE
NOW THINGS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT
WE WOULD CALL MY AUNT IN THE CITY OF HOMS YOU SAW EARLIER FEARING FOR HER LIFE
BECAUSE WE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE IN THE BACKGROUND
NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE LINE WOULD DISCONNECT AT ANY MOMENT
WHETHER WE WOULD GET TO HEAR HER VOICE AGAIN
SINCE 2011 I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING TO TURKEY TO WORK WITH A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION CALLED UOSSM
VOLUNTEERING IN THEIR REFUGEE CAMPS AND FIELD HOSPITALS
IN THE MEANWHILE IT CALLS FOR A CONCERTED EFFORT
TO EDUCATE AND PROVIDE FOR THE MILLIONS OF YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR BASIC RIGHTS
OTHERWISE
THIS LOST GENERATION OF SYRIANS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY
LIVING THEIR LIVES PARALLEL TO OURS
INVISIBLY
AND ONE DAY
OUR GRANDCHILDREN WILL READ THE HISTORY BOOKS
AND WONDER HOW DID THE WORLD EVER LET THIS HAPPEN
FORTUNATELY
THOSE BOOKS HAVE YET TO BE READ
IT IS OUR GENERATION THAT MUST REWRITE THIS NARRATIVE
TAKING A MOMENT TO SHOW GRATITUDE
TO BE MORE AWARE
TO REFLECT ON THE PROBLEMS THAT CRIPPLE OUR COLLECTIVE EXISTENCE
AND AS A SYRIAN AMERICAN I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE VOICE FOR THE SYRIAN COMMUNITY
TO UTILIZE THE RESOURCES THAT I HAVE BEEN AFFORDED
AND ALTHOUGH SOMEDAYS WE FEEL UTTERLY HOPELESS
THAT THE WORK THAT YOU AND I DO FOR THE RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES WE CARE FOR
PALES IN MAGNITUDE TO THE PROBLEM AT HAND
OR EVEN WORSE
I'LL FEEL GUILTY
GUILTY THAT HAVE BECOME SO SELF ABSORBED WITH MY OWN LIFE
THAT I HAVEN'T PUT TIME ASIDE
TO THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE I CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT SO MUCH
AND IN THOSE MOMENTS
I THINK TOWARD MY MOTHER A
PERSON I HOLD VERY DEAR TO MY LIFE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN MY BIGGEST SOURCE OF INSPIRATION
WHEN THE REVOLUTION BEGAN IN 2011 SHE DROPPED ALL HER OBLIGATIONS AND BOOKED A FLIGHT TO TURKEY
IN HOPES OF FINDING AN ORGANIZATION THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM HER SKILLS AS A PHARMACIST
AND SHE WORKED TIRELESSLY FROM REFUGEE CAMP TO FIELD HOSPITAL
TO MANAGEMENT AND HAS NOW OPENED A BRANCH OF THE ORGANIZATION HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES TO ENGAGE WITH OUR GOVERNMENT
AND I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW SHE MAINTAINED HER INNER DRIVE
THAT BURNING PASSION THAT CAN BE SEEN BY SIMPLY LOOKING INTO HER EYES AS SHE SPEAKS TO YOU
BUT NOW IT HAS BECOME VERY CLEAR
SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE WORK SHE IS DOING TODAY IS NOT FOR HER
IT'S NOT FOR HER REPUTATION
OR THE ORGANIZATION SHE WORKS FOR
IT'S FOR THESE YOUNG CHILDREN
WHOSE INNOCENCE HAS BEEN ROBBED AND MEMORIES SCARRED BY THE IMAGES OF BLOOD LITERALLY FLOWING DOWN THEIR STREETS
YET
IN THEIR PRESENCE IN TURKEY
I FELT AN INNATE SENSE OF HOPE
THEIR LAUGHTER AND ENDEARING SMILE WOULD ALWAYS LIGHTEN THE ROOM PUSHING ME TO PERSEVERE
SO YES
WE ARE WORKING FOR MARYAM
WE ARE WORKING FOR NOORA AND THE COUNTLESS OTHERS WHO ARE REACHING THEIR HANDS OUT TO US RIGHT NOW
GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE A WORLD OF JUSTICE
A WORLD WHERE EVERY INDIVIDUAL'S HUMANITY IS RECOGNIZED AND CELEBRATED
A WORLD THAT EVERYONE CAN CALL HOME
THANK YOU
JUST BECAUSE IT IS NOT HAPPENING HERE
TO US IN OUR HOMES DOES NOT MAKE IT ANY LESS OF A HUMAN CONDITION
THESE ARE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE THE SAME CAPACITY TO FEEL JOY
TO RECIPROCATE LOVE
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF THEIR DIGNITY AND SELF WORTH
JUST AS THE CIVILIAN OPPOSITION HAS BEEN DROWNED OUT BY THE TYRANNY OF THE ASSAD REGIME AND THE RADICAL IDEOLOGY OF TERROR GROUPS LIKE ISIS
I MET A MAN NAMED OMAR
A 27 YEAR OLD WHO WAS PARALYZED FROM THE WAIST DOWN
BY AN AIRSTRIKE ON THE MARKETPLACE THAT TOOK HIS WIFE
AND ONE YEAR OLD NEWBORN CHILD
AND AS HE SAT THERE AS I TENDED TO HIS INJURIES AT THE POST OPERATIONAL CLINIC IN TURKEY
HE SHOWED ME THIS
I RAN OR HOW LOUD I SCREAMED I COULD NOT SAVE THE YOUNG MOTHER AND HER CHILD WHO WERE TAKING NAP
UNABLE TO HEAR THE SCREAMS OF THEIR NEIGHBORS
I COULD ONLY IMAGINE THE FACE OF A HUSBAND
COMING HOME AFTER LONG DAY OF WORK
ONLY TO FIND HIS HOME DESTROYED
AND BEING TOLD HIS FAMILY LIES UNDERNEATH
AND I JUST STOOD THERE
WATCHING HELPLESSLY AS THE SMOKE ROSE
TO THE HEAVENS
AND AUNTS COOKING EVERY DAY FOR A WHOLE MONTH IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER
LOCAL OFFICIALS PROCEEDED TO ARREST AND TORTURE A YOUNG BOY NAMED HAMZA AL KHATEEB
KILLING HIM IN THE PROCESS AND THEN HAVING THE DESPICABLE AUDACITY TO SEND HIS BODY BACK TO HIS FAMILY'S DOORSTEP
THIS BECAME THE CATALYST FOR THE SYRIAN PEOPLE TO REVOLT
FOR THEIR FREEDOMS FOR THEIR DEMOCRACY
PEACEFUL PROTESTS TURNED TO ORGANIZED UPRISING
AS THE GOVERNMENT TARGETED CIVILIAN CROWDS
AS THE OPPOSITION PICKED UP
HOMS
SYRIA IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A CONFLICT AND GENOCIDE THAT HAS TAKEN THE LIVES OF 470000 SOULS
AND LEFT MORE THAN 11 MILLION DISPLACED OF THEIR ORIGINAL HOMES
11 MILLION IT
ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR COPYRIGHT BECAUSE THEN IF MY FAKE PLACE SHOWS UP ON YOUR MAP I CAN BE WELL AND TRULY SURE THAT YOU HAVE ROBBED ME
WORLD IS CHANGED BY OUR MAPS OF THE WORLD THE WAY THAT WE CHOOSE TO
SORT OF OUR PERSONAL CARTOGRAPHIC ENTERPRISE ALSO SHAPES THE MAP OF OUR LIVES AND THAT IN TURN SHAPES OUR LIVES I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE MAP
CHANGES THE LIFE WE LEAD AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN SOME LIKE SECRECY OPRAH'S ANGELS NETWORK LIKE
YOU CAN THINK YOUR WAY OUT OF CANCER SENSE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WHILE MAPS DON'T SHOW YOU WHERE YOU WILL GO IN YOUR LIFE
THEY SHOW YOU WHERE YOU MIGHT GO YOU VERY RARELY GO TO A PLACE THAT ISN'T ON YOUR PERSONAL MAP
SO I WAS A REALLY TERRIBLE STUDENT WHEN I WAS A KID MY GPA WAS CONSISTENTLY IN THE LOW 2S AND I THINK THE REASON THAT I WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE STUDENT IS THAT I FELT LIKE EDUCATION WAS JUST A SERIES OF HURDLES THAT HAD BEEN
FERDINAND WASN'T PARTICULARLY WELL LIKED BY HIS UNCLE THE EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH NOW THAT IS A
AND HER NAME WAS AMANDA AND I HAD A CRUSH ON HER AND SHE LIKED EMILY DICKINSON POETRY
THE REASON I CAN TELL YOU WHAT OPPORTUNITY COST IS IS BECAUSE ONE DAY WHEN I WAS PLAYING SUPER MARIO KART ON MY COUCH MY FRIEND EMMET WALKED IN AND HE SAID HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PLAYING SUPER MARIO KART AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW LIKE SIX HOURS AND HE SAID
YOU REALIZE THAT IF
SOME LAND AND THINKING I THINK I'LL DRAW THAT BIT OF LAND
AND THEN WONDERING MAYBE THERE'S SOME MORE LAND TO DRAW
AND THAT'S WHEN LEARNING REALLY BEGAN FOR ME IT'S TRUE THAT I HAD TEACHERS THAT DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THOSE TEACHERS BECAUSE I OFTEN GAVE THEM CAUSE TO THINK THERE WAS NO REASON TO INVEST IN ME
BUT A LOT OF THE LEARNING THAT I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL
WASN'T ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE CLASSROOM IT WAS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM FOR INSTANCE I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN
THAT THE FIRST BIG WAR OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BEGAN WITH AN ACT OF
SHAPE OF THE WORLD IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO AFFECT OUR MAPS
BUT WHAT I FIND A LOT MORE INTERESTING IS THE WAY
THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MAP THE WORLD
CHANGES THE WORLD
BECAUSE THE WORLD WOULD TRULY BE A DIFFERENT PLACE IF NORTH WERE
AT BASKIN ROBBINS THOSE SIX HOURS YOU COULD HAVE MADE THIRTY DOLLARS SO IN SOME WAYS YOU JUST PAID THIRTY DOLLARS TO PLAY SUPER MARIO KART {LG} BUT I LEARNED
FEELING THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING PART OF A COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED TOGETHER IN CARTOGRAPHIC ENTERPRISE OF TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND MAP THE WORLD AROUND US AND THEN IN
ON THEIR FEET TODAY'S QUESTION IS WHY LIKE MOST SIMPLE QUESTIONS THERE'S
LEAST SOME OF THE CALCULUS THAT UNDERLIES ALL OF THAT STUFF SO I HAD ONE LEARNING COMMUNITY IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER FOR COLLEGE AND THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER WHEN I STARTED WORKING AT MAGAZINE CALLED BOOKLIST WHERE I WAS
PROCESS AND I'M HAPPY TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS SPOTTY IT WAS INCONSISTENT THERE WAS LOT I DIDN'T KNOW I MIGHT KNOW YOU KNOW THAT CANTOR'S IDEA THAT SOME INFINITE SETS ARE
A BRILLIANT COMMUNITY BUILDER AND THE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT BUILT UP AROUND THESE VIDEOS WAS IN MANY WAYS A COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS SO WE PLAYED ZE FRANK AT CHESS
THAT MY IRONIC OH SO COOL DISENGAGEMENT WASN'T CLEVER OR FUNNY BUT LIKE IT WAS A SIMPLE AND UNSPECTACULAR RESPONSE TO VERY COMPLICATED AND COMPELLING PROBLEMS AND SO I STARTED TO LEARN BECAUSE LEARNING WAS COOL I LEARNED THAT
COMPLICATED QUESTIONS THAT ARE ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS AND BECAUSE THE YOUTUBE PAGE IS SET UP SO THAT THE PLACE IN WHICH I'M TALKING TO YOU
IS ON THE EXACT SAME PAGE AS YOUR COMMENTS YOU ARE
WITH GOOD JOBS WOKE UP VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING
AND THE MEN WHO HAD GOOD JOBS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY DID
WAS TIE A STRANGULATION ITEM OF CLOTHING AROUND THEIR NECKS
THEY LITERALLY PUT NOOSES ON THEMSELVES AND THEN THEY WENT OFF TO THEIR JOBS WHATEVER THEY WERE
THAT'S NOT A RECIPE FOR A HAPPY LIFE
THESE PEOPLE IN MY SYMBOL OBSESSED TWELVE YEAR OLD IMAGINATION THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRANGLING THEMSELVES AS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY DO EACH MORNING THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY BE HAPPY WHY WOULD I WANT TO JUMP OVER ALL THESE HURDLES AND HAVE THAT BE THE END
THAT'S TERRIBLE END
AND THEN WHEN I WAS IN TENTH GRADE I WENT TO THIS SCHOOL
{LG} AND IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICS AND WORLD HISTORY THAT PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO LEARN THROUGH YOUTUBE HERE'S A VIDEO ABOUT ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS
YOUR MAP OF NEW YORK ARE GOING TO LOOK VERY SIMILAR ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHAPE OF NEW YORK OFTEN MAP MAKERS WILL INSERT FAKE
MANY WAYS IT IS BECAUSE HERE IS THE INSTRUCTOR IT'S LIKE THE OLD FASHIONED CLASSROOM HERE'S THE INSTRUCTOR AND THEN BENEATH THE INSTRUCTOR IS THE STUDENTS AND THEY'RE ALL HAVING A CONVERSATION AND I KNOW THAT YOUTUBE COMMENTS HAVE A VERY BAD
WRITE DOWN ON PAPER CAN CHANGE THE ACTUAL WORLD IN WHICH WE'RE ACTUALLY LIVING WHICH IS WHY MY THIRD BOOK IS CALLED PAPER TOWNS
AM BIASED BUT I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS THE YOUTUBE PAGE RESEMBLES A CLASSROOM LOOK FOR INSTANCE AT MINUTE PHYSICS A
THAT WAS MY WAY BACK INTO BEING A COMMUNITY LEARNER AGAIN HERE'S ZE TALKING ABOUT LAS VEGAS
BELIEVE
THAT THESE SPACES THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BECOME
FOR A NEW GENERATION OF LEARNERS
THE KIND OF COMMUNITIES THE KIND OF CARTOGRAPHIC COMMUNITIES THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN AGAIN WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND AS AN
JG SO HERE'S SOMETHING ALL OF THESE VIDEOS HAVE IN COMMON THEY ALL HAVE MORE THAN HALF MILLION VIEWS ON YOUTUBE AND THOSE ARE
COMPLAINTS MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT CALCULUS IS INTERESTING AND BEAUTIFUL AND HERE'S WAY IN TO THINKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM THAT YOU FIND UNSOLVABLE YOU CAN GO TO PLACES LIKE REDDIT AND FIND SUB
DAILY BASIS AND IT'S TRUE THAT I DON'T USE MOST OF THEM FOR MY JOB BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT FOR ME IT'S ABOUT CARTOGRAPHY WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF CARTOGRAPHY IT'S YOU KNOW
THE INITIALS OF THE TWO GUYS WHO MADE THIS MAP ERNEST G ALPERS AND OTTO LINDBERG AND THEY RELEASED THIS MAP IN 1937
DECADES LATER
RAND MCNALLY RELEASES A MAP
WITH AGLOE NEW YORK ON IT
AT THE SAME EXACT INTERSECTION OF TWO DIRT ROADS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
WELL YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DELIGHT OVER AT GENERAL DRAFTING THEY IMMEDIATELY CALLED RAND MCNALLY AND THEY SAY WE'VE CAUGHT YOU WE MADE AGLOE NEW YORK UP IT IS A FAKE PLACE IT'S A PAPER TOWN WE'RE GOING TO SUE YOUR PANTS OFF
AND RAND MCNALLY SAYS NO NO NO NO AGLOE IS REAL
OF COURSE ALL FOODS ARE PROCESSED AGRICULTURE IS A KIND OF PROCESS SO IS COOKING FERMENTING DICING PRESERVING
ALL FOODS ARE PROCESSED AND OFTEN THEY ARE BETTER FOR IT
BUT INCREASINGLY THEY ARE NOT
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT IT LESS IMPORTANT WHAT WE'RE EATING THAN HOW WE'RE EATING IT
THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORN ON THE COB VERSUS CORN CHIPS VERSUS HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
SAME SOURCE THREE VERY DIFFERENT FOODS BECAUSE OF THEIR LEVEL OF PROCESSING
I SPENT LOT OF TIME WRANGLING OVER THE PARTICULARS OVER THE MANY THINGS THAT WE FIND ON OUR INGREDIENT LABELS THESE
THROUGH HERE
I LIKE TO SAY THAT IT IS THE ELLIS ISLAND FOR MEXICAN
PRODUCE A WATERMELON HOW DOES A WATERMELON GET FROM THE GROUND IN HERMOSILLO TO A SAFEWAY IN TUCSON
IT STARTS ON A FARM A REALLY BIG FARM 1000 ACRES OF WATERMELON
A MIGRATING FIELD CREW GOES IN THERE AND HARVESTS THEM WITHIN A DAY THEY PACK THEM UP PUT THEM ON SEMI TRUCK 40000 POUNDS OF VEGETABLES AND SEND THEM NORTH TO THE BORDER
THERE'S A FLURRY OF PAPERWORK THE BORDER PATROL FDA USDA AND
LET'S GO TO THE SECOND PROCESS ONCE THAT FOOD HAS GOTTEN TO YOU WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY WHEN YOU ACTUALLY EAT IT
SUGAR IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW THE WHAT OF A PARTICULAR FOOD IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN
THE HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME IS EATING UNPROCESSED HARD
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS SUGAR
SUGAR IS IN EVERYTHING
BEFORE I GO THERE I WILL SAY I LOVE SUGAR
I HAVE SUCH A VORACIOUS SWEET TOOTH THAT WHEN I WAS A KID MY MOM INSTITUTED A RULE CALLED ONE SWEET A DAY ON WHICH I WAS ALLOWED ONE SWEET EVERYDAY INSTEAD OF
ALL THE SWEETS ALL THE DAYS
BUT SUGAR IS IN EVERYTHING APART
THREE PROCESSES
THE FIRST IS THE PROCESS OF HOW A FOOD GETS FROM ITS SOURCE TO YOUR TABLE HOW VEGETABLES GET FROM THE GROUND IN MEXICO FOR EXAMPLE TO A GROCERY STORE IN ARIZONA
THE SECOND PROCESS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN YOU ACTUALLY EAT THAT FOOD HOW YOUR BODY RESPONDS WHEN YOU DRINK A GLASS OF APPLE JUICE VERSUS EATING AN APPLE
THE THIRD PROCESS IS LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED IT IS THE PROCESS OF HOW THE FOODS WE BUY IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES WE LIVE IN
OFTEN THIS PROCESS REVOLVES AROUND MONEY IT IS THE ECONOMY OF FOOD
AND IT IS THIS LAST ONE THAT OF CONSUMER SPENDING THAT I FIND THE MOST POTENTIAL FOR UN PROCESSING
HOME MADE CHOCOLATE MADE WITH RAW HONEY COOKIES MADE WITH WHOLEGRAIN FLOUR AND MOLASSES AND BUTTER
THESE SWEETS SATISFY MY SWEET CRAVING THEY FILLED ME UP AND BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL BOUND UP IN THE FOODS WITH SUBSTANCE THAT SUGAR TRICKLED INTO MY BODY SLOWER
A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHEN I TELL THEM ABOUT MY YEAR OF EATING UNPROCESSED FOOD HOW DO
YOU FEEL DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY
AND THE EASIEST ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS SIMPLY
I FEEL FULL
FOR ME THIS IS NO SMALL THING
I HAVE DIETED ON AND OFF MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE COUNTED CALORIES I'VE DONE WEIGHT WATCHERS REALLY I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE WRINGER
BUT UNPROCESS IS NOT A DIET
WHEN I EAT UNPROCESSED I EAT WHEN I'M HUNGRY AND I STOP EATING WHEN I'M FULL
DURING MY YEAR I DIDN'T GAIN WEIGHT OR LOSE WEIGHT BUT I ATE A LOT OF DELICIOUS FOOD
IF THERE IS ONE TAKE AWAY FROM SUGAR IT IS THAT
IF YOU'RE GOING TO EAT SOMETHING SWEET MAKE IT COUNT SAVOR IT MAKE IT YOUR ONE SWEET A DAY
DON'T WASTE YOUR SUGAR ON MUSTARD
WE ARE WITHHOLDING IT FROM THE BALANCE SHEETS OF THOSE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WHO ARE THEN USING IT OUR MONEY TO INFLUENCE POLITICS TO GROW UNSUSTAINABLE FOOD TO WASTE ENERGY IN SHORT TO PROCESS AND SELL US FOODS THAT AREN'T GOOD FOR
BEFORE I'LL GO THERE I WILL SAY I WAS RAISED BY TWO VEGETARIANS
I'VE BEEN A VEGETARIAN ON AND OFF MY WHOLE LIFE
PROBLEM ALWAYS BEING I ACTUALLY KIND OF LIKED TO EAT MEAT BUT I READ WHAT WE HAVE READ HOW DESTRUCTIVE INDUSTRIAL MEAT IS TO THE ENVIRONMENT WATER OUR SOILS HOW ANIMALS ARE TREATED
HOW CAN I EAT MEAT IN A WAY THAT SEEMED RESPONSIBLE
I SPENT TWO DAYS IN VERY CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THIS SHEEP
AND HERE'S THE SURPRISE IT DIDN'T TURN ME OFF MEAT
INSTEAD IT MADE ME SO GRATEFUL THAT I COULD GO TO THE FARMERS MARKET AND PAY TO A LOCAL RANCHER WHO HAD GONE TO THE SAME PROCESS WITH THE SAME REVERENCE RESPECT AS I HAD AND GIVE ME MEAT IN RETURN
I COULD PAY MONEY FOR MINDFULLY PRODUCED MEAT
INDEED IF THERE IS ONE TAKEAWAY FROM MY YEAR UNPROCESSED IT IS SIMPLY THAT
THE MONEY YOU SPEND MATTERS
I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD ALL BUTCHER OUR OWN
MEAT AND GRIND OUR OWN GRAINS OR GROW OUR OWN FOOD WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WHEN YOU DO IT YOURSELF YOU REALIZE IT IS SO WORTH THE MONEY TO PAY SOMEONE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO'S DOING
LET'S MOVE ON TO THAT LAST PROCESS
HOW DO THE FOODS WE BUY IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES WE LIVE IN
LET'S GO BACK TO TONIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT TO EAT
MOST OF US ASSUME IF WE WANT TO HAVE A HEALTHY SUSTAINABLE MEAL WE NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME
WHEN I STARTED MY YEAR UN PROCESSED I WAS A VERY BUSY GRADUATE STUDENT EARNING A GRADUATE STUDENT SALARY OF ABOUT 18000 DOLLARS A YEAR
I LIVED IN THIS TINY LITTLE APARTMENT WITHOUT ENOUGH SHADE TO GROW A BASIL PLANT
THROUGHOUT MY YEAR I SAVED EVERY GROCERY RECEIPT FOR EVERY RUN IN AND RUN OUT PURCHASE AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR I SAT DOWN AND I TALLIED THEM UP
THE GRAND TOTAL THE AMOUNT I SPENT TO FEED MYSELF IN MY YEAR UNPROCESSED
WAS ABOUT 4900 DOLLARS
THIS
THIS IS WHAT I EAT
THIS IS ONE WEEK SHARE FROM THE TUCSON CSA THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTED AGRICULTURE PROGRAM THAT I'M A MEMBER OF
THIS PRODUCE COMES FROM A FARM OWNED BY A GUY NAMED FRANK
YES WE CALL HIM FARMER FRANK
FARMER FRANK SENDS HIS TWO EMPLOYEES OUT INTO THE FIELD THEY HARVEST ENOUGH PRODUCE FOR ABOUT 150 SHARES WASH IT PUT IT ON A TRUCK AND SEND IT TO TUCSON
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF STORAGE AND THERE ARE NO PESTICIDES
IT ARRIVES HERE
TO A 35 DEGREE WAREHOUSE IN NOGALES
THERE ABOUT 100 OF THEM THERE AND I SPENT A FEW DAYS WANDERING THROUGH THESE WAREHOUSES AND LET ME TELL YOU THE SCALE IS STAGGERING
AT THIS PARTICULAR WAREHOUSE DURING THEIR HIGH SEASON EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY MIGHT MOVE IN AND OUT 150000 MELONS
I REMEMBER STANDING IN THIS WAREHOUSE FULL OF MANGOES AND IT BEING INCONCEIVABLE TO ME HOW THIS MASS OF FRUIT MIGHT EVER JUST BECOME ONE MANGO IN ONE PERSON'S KITCHEN
THE SYSTEM IS VAST
AND ITS SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON PESTICIDES REFRIGERATION AND SEMI TRUCKS
EIGHT O'CLOCK
YOU STOP AT THE STORE ON THE WAY HOME TO SEE IF THEY HAVE KALE
BUT IS IT ORGANIC IS IT LOCAL IS IT IN SEASON DO
YOU EVEN LIKE KALE
I GET IT IT IS OVERWHELMING ALL OF THE CHOICES WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY ALL OF THE THINGS WE'RE ASKED TO CONSIDER ABOUT OUR FOOD
A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AGO I SET MYSELF A CHALLENGE
ONE YEAR WITHOUT PROCESSED FOOD
THE FIRST QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK ARE WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
AND WHAT MAKES A FOOD PROCESSED
AND I'LL GET TO THOSE
BUT TONIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT CHOICE OF A WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT TO EAT
I AM A FOOD WRITER SO ON SOME LEVEL I'M PAID TO THINK ABOUT THAT CHOICE I'M THE EDITOR OF EDIBLE BAJA ARIZONA A LOCAL FOOD MAGAZINE BASED HERE IN TUCSON
BUT I ALSO HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT THESE CHOICES MATTER
THAT THEY IMPACT THE FOOD SYSTEM AND WE HAVE THE POWER TO UNPROCESS THE FOODS WE
EAT
SO WHAT MAKES A FOOD
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE AMOUNT I SPENT TO FEED MYSELF THREE MOSTLY ORGANIC LARGELY LOCAL TOTALLY UNPROCESSED MEALS FOR A YEAR WAS ABOUT 4 DOLLARS 50 CENTS A MEAL
I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR WHOM 4 50C A MEAL IS SIMPLY UNAFFORDABLE IT IS OUT OF THEIR REACH I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT I DEDICATED THE LAST CHAPTER OF MY BOOK TO THE ENDEAVOR OF EATING UNPROCESSED ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT FOOD STAMPS RECIPIENTS RECEIVE WHICH IS ABOUT 20 DOLLARS A WEEK
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS MOST OF US HAVE A FEW DOLLARS THAT WE COULD SPEND DIFFERENTLY
THIS IS THE HIDE OF A SHEEP THAT I SPENT TWO DAYS HELPING TO SLAUGHTER BUTCHER AND PROCESS USING NOTHING BUT AN 8 INCH CRAFTSMAN
SPENT A YEAR THINKING ABOUT PROCESSED FOOD I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT BUT TONIGHT I WANT TO FOCUS
APART FROM ALL THAT THE REASON FOR EATING UNPROCESSED MAKES SENSE TO ME IS THAT IT IS SIMPLER
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE MY FOOD IS COMING FROM BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE IS COMING FROM I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WHAT IS DOING TO MY BODY BECAUSE I FEEL GOOD
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE MY MONEY IS GOING BECAUSE I KNOW WHO'S GETTING MY MONEY
IT'S ONE RULE AND THEN I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
I CAN DO WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WITH FOOD WHICH IS SIMPLY ENJOY IT
AFTER ALL THE POINT OF FOOD IS NOT TO STRESS US OUT IT IS TO BRING US TOGETHER
WE HAVE THE POWER TO UN PROCESS OUR FOOD SYSTEM
OF COURSE WE DON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU DO THINGS AND I DO THINGS
YOU GO HOME TO MAKE DINNER I GO HOME TO MAKE DINNER
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU AND I DECIDE TO MAKE SMALL CHANGES IN OUR OWN LIVES THAT BIG CHANGE BEGINS TO
HAPPEN
JOIN THE CSA
READ INGREDIENTS LABELS GO TO THE FARMERS MARKET
ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE AND COMPANIES THAT SELL YOU YOUR FOOD
WHAT DO YOU EAT
THAT'S UP TO YOU
BUT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE IT A LITTLE UNPROCESSED
THANK YOU
IS THE PROCESS OF HOW THAT FOOD GETS TO YOU
ON AVERAGE 91 CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND ON FOOD GOES TO THE MIDDLEMAN IT DOESN'T GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO GROW OUR FOOD
SO WHEN YOU BUY FOOD THAT'S GONE THROUGH THIS VAST SYSTEM YOU ARE SUPPORTING THAT 91 CENTS
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN YOU BUY FOOD FROM A CSA OR A FARMERS MARKET YOU ARE HELPING TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO GROW YOUR OWN FOOD GET MORE THAN 9 CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR
IS PROCESSED COMES DOWN TO A QUOTE FROM OF ALL PEOPLE MR ROGERS
WHICH SAYS THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THINGS PEOPLE MAKE AND THINGS THAT ARE MADE
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOODS PEOPLE MAKE WITH HANDS OR COULD BAKE AND FOODS THAT ARE MADE BY MACHINES
PEOPLE CAN MAKE CORN INTO CORN TORTILLAS
PEOPLE CAN'T REALLY MAKE HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP WITHOUT ACCESS TO LABORATORY AND AN ADVANCED CHEMISTRY DEGREE
OTHER ANIMALS HAVE MANY OF THE SAME FEELINGS AND MOTIVATIONS THAT PEOPLE DO BUT THIS IS KIND OF AN
IT'S A WHAT WE CALL OUR TRAINING VIDEO AND IT DEMONSTRATES HOW WE DID THIS
BEFORE I START IT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TWO DOGS IN THIS VIDEO
THE FIRST DOG CALLIE IS MY DOG
SHE WAS ACTUALLY THE REPLACEMENT FOR NEWTON SHE WAS ADOPTED HERE IN ATLANTA FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETY WE LOVED NEWTON SO MUCH WE COULD NEVER GET ANOTHER PUG SO CALLIE IS THE ANTI PUG THE
I REALLY LOVE THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE STARTED THIS JUST AS MY SILLY EXAMPLE OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MY DOGS THINK AND WHETHER THEY LOVE ME IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN MUCH BIGGER
IT MEANS THAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAS HAPPENED AND THE ANIMAL NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING IN THIS CASE IT'S QUITE SIMPLE BECAUSE THEY WILL JUST EAT THE HOT DOGS
TO HOT DOGS
IT'S TO THE HAND SIGNAL THAT MEANS HOT DOGS
YOU MAY THINK THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IT'S STILL HOT DOGS IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT DOGS LIKE HOT DOGS
BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE WE TRAIN THIS SIGNAL IT'S A SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF A HOT DOG THAT THE DOG HAS LEARNED AND HAS LEARNED TO RECOGNIZE THIS MEANING
THE
PARTICULAR PARTS OF
TO PREDICT WHICH OF THOSE DOGS WILL ACTUALLY BE GOOD SERVICE
THIS STARTED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND WE'VE SINCE GONE ON AND DONE MANY OTHER EXPERIMENTS MOST OF THE DOGS IN THESE PICTURES ARE STILL WORKING WITH US IN THE PROJECT
WE'VE DONE THINGS LOOKING AT HOW THEIR OLFACTION OR THEIR SENSORY
SYSTEM FOR SMELL
BUT IN FACT WE DID FIND A DIFFERENCE WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING ABOUT IT
THINGS THAT WE DID WAS WE ACTUALLY REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT I SHOWED YOU WHERE WE SHOW THE DIFFERENT HAND SIGNALS
WITH ONE LITTLE TWIST
WE MANIPULATE WHO GIVES THE SIGNALS DOES IT MATTER IF THE DOG'S OWNER GIVES SIGNAL
OR WHETHER A STRANGER COMES IN AND GIVES THE SIGNAL
OR EVEN WHETHER COMPUTER GIVES THE SIGNAL
BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE PAVLOV AND ALL THE BEHAVIORIST WHO FOLLOWED HIM
IT REALLY SHOULDN'T MATTER BECAUSE ANY SIGNAL THAT INDICATES AN UPCOMING FOOD TREAT IS ALL THE SAME IF ANIMALS AND DOGS ARE JUST KIND OF
HOW THEY IDENTIFY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND OTHER DOGS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD BY SMELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND IS THAT THIS REWARD SYSTEM THE SAME PART OF THE BRAIN ACTIVATES WHEN THE DOGS SMELL A FAMILIAR HUMAN
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT PROVIDES US WITH A NEURAL BIOMARKER OF THE DOG'S PERSONALITY PROFILE IN
IS ACTIVITY IN THE REWARD SYSTEM OF THEIR BRAIN TO THIS HAND SIGNAL BUT NOT THIS
WITH THIS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS WAS GOING TO WORK SO WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE
THIS'S JUST STRAIGHT UP PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING WHERE WE TAUGHT THE DOGS TWO HAND SIGNALS THIS MEANS HOT DOG AND THIS MEANS NO HOT
DOG
IF THIS TECHNIQUE WORKS WHAT WE
DOGS
ARE SPECIAL THEY'RE THE FIRST
DOMESTICATED ANIMALS
THEY HAVE BEEN WITH HUMANS SINCE HUMANS HAVE BEEN HUMANS WHEN
WE LOOK AT THEIR BRAINS IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE ARE LOOKING BACK IN TIME AND IT'S GIVING US A PICTURE OF HOW THE DOG HUMAN BOND FORMED
THANK YOU
HE LIVED TO BE ABOUT 15 YEARS OLD
AFTER HE PASSED AWAY
I THOUGHT I HAVE THESE TOOLS
THIS MRI MACHINE THAT I HAVE BEEN USING FOR DECADES TO STUDY HUMAN DECISION MAKING AND WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE
WHY HAVEN'T WE USED THIS ON OTHER ANIMALS
NOT THERE WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME DO DOGS MISS US WHEN WE ARE GONE I HAVE TO SAY YES BECAUSE
WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE REMEMBERING THEIR HUMANS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THEM AND THAT IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THESE REWARD RESPONSES
IS IT STILL JUST HOT DOGS
TO
ANSWER THIS QUESTION ONE
TRY TO
INFER WHAT THEY ARE THINKING
THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF BEHAVIORISM AND IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE PAVLOV
BUT THERE OF COURSE VERY TRICKY ISSUES HERE AND HUMANS BEING HUMANS WE TEND TO ANTHROPOMORPHIZE EVERYTHING
IT'S KIND OF IN THIS AREA THAT I BECAME VERY INTERESTED IN INTRIGUED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DOGS ARE THINKING
BY USING
MRI
THE
TECHNIQUE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES THE IDEA IS IF WE WERE STUDYING A HUMAN
WE WOULD PUT A HUMAN IN AN MRI
HAVE THEM DO SOME TYPE OF TASK AND WE'D MEASURE BLOOD FLOW OR BRAIN ACTIVITY AND THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PARTS OF THE BRAIN DO WHAT
VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF YOU'VE HAD AN MRI IT'S NOT TERRIBLY PLEASANT BUT PEOPLE WILL DO IT
HOW
DO WE DO THIS WITH OTHER ANIMALS HOW DO WE DO IT WITH A DOG
35 OF DOGS THAT ENTER THESE PROGRAMS TO TRAIN TO BE ASSISTANCE DOGS WILL SUCCEED THE OTHER 2 3
END UP BEING RELEASED AND ADOPTED TO THEIR PUPPY RAISERS
SO WE'VE PARTNERED WITH CCI
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRAINING THEIR DOGS TO DO THE MRI PROCEDURE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
DONE IS WE'VE SPUN OFF A NEW PROJECT WHICH WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT WE'VE
ARE THE SIMILARITIES BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO HAVE A COMMONALITY OF EXPERIENCE WITH DOGS AND OTHER ANIMALS FOR THAT MATTER WE HAVE TO SHARE THE SAME OR SIMILAR BRAIN STRUCTURES DARWIN SAID THIS 150
OF SCIENCE THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SO I EMBARKED ON THIS PROJECT ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DOGS THINK AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT DOGS THINK OF US
STUFF AS A WHOLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS WE CURRENTLY SPEND 21 TRILLION DOLLARS A
BLOOD AND THEY FOUND 287 DIFFERENT CHEMICALS IN
AND AGAIN WE USE A MILLION METRIC TONS OF THIS A YEAR WHICH IS PARTICULARLY BAD IF YOU WORK
COLD SO THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORS ARE CLOSED AND I GET THIS MASSIVE HEADACHE I KEEP
ACTUALLY JUST THE OPPOSITE THEY SHARE ALL OF THAT MATERIAL THROUGH THE MYCORRHIZAL LAYER AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE
LIKE I WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE MY HOUSE REALLY BEAUTIFUL WITH DIFFERENT COLOR PAINT I'M PAINTING AND PAINTING ONE
LABELS WHEN YOU PAY FOR SOMETHING PAY ATTENTION WHAT IS IN IT WHAT DO I
IT IS ALSO A RESPIRATORY SENSITIZER WHICH MEANS THE MORE YOU ARE EXPOSED TO IT
AND OUR BUILDINGS AND OUR CITIES THAT NOT ONLY WOULD FEEL MORE NATURAL THEY WOULD PERFORM
FUNCTION THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO
WHAT IF WE HAD COMPANIES DOING THE SAME THING COULD COMPANIES ACTUALLY STOP COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER BUT COOPERATE WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING THAT NOW WITH OUR DESIGN CHALLENGES WE'RE BRINGING TOGETHER
CAN KILL THE EMULATED ORGANISM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MODEL
1 OF THEM WE UNDERSTAND THE HAZARDS OF 1 OF THEM AND THEN WHEN WE LIVE IN DENSE AREAS LIKE CITIES ALL OF SUDDEN THE IMPACTS OF THAT BECOMES LOT
I TAKE THIS DEEP BREATH AND I INSTANTLY FELT BETTER I KNOW YOU'RE
YOUR CARPETS IT'S EVERYWHERE BUT I HAVE TWO GOOD BOOKS FOR YOU HE HANDED ME THESE TWO BOOKS THAT LITERALLY
DAY I'M AT WORK AND I'M TELLING MY PAINT STORY TO A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AND HE SAID OH
OF COURSE YOU FELT BETTER BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE BREATHING FRESH AIR BUT THE FACT
AND WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH OUR STUFF WE PILE
NUMBER WE'LL SEE IN THERE IS ACTUALLY LEAD POISONING AND THAT COMES FROM THE FACT THAT HOUSES BUILT BEFORE 1978 WERE MADE WITH LEAD PAINT RIGHT WE
FORMALDEHYDE IS DOING IS IT'S ACTING LIKE A GLUE AND IT'S KEEPING THOSE BONDS IN PLACE
THEM SO THAT THEY EXUDE THIS MUCUS I WILL HAVE A GREEN
BIRTH DEFECTS AND ULTIMATELY DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS
AND WHERE WERE THESE CHEMICALS COMING FROM
THEY'RE COMING FROM OUR STUFF
THEY'RE COMING FROM OUR CONSUMER GOODS THEY'RE COMING FROM OUR PESTICIDES THEY'RE COMING FROM THE WASTE THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BURN OUR STUFF OUR GARBAGE
SO IT'S NOT REALLY SURPRISING THAT WE'RE SPENDING IN THIS COUNTRY ALONE AGAIN ON ONE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION KIDS
HEALTHY COMPANY AT A TIME AS CONSUMERS I WANT US TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE CHOICES TOO WE HAVE
IS A GROUP AT MIT THAT JUST CREATED THE MOST WATER REPELLENT FINISH TO DAY SUPPOSEDLY 40 MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN CREATED THUS FAR THEY
21 TRILLION DOLLARS AT STAKE THINK THEY WILL PAY ATTENTION SO WHAT CAN YOU DO I
HIS PARTNER DR MEGAN SCHWARZMAN RUN A CLASS CALLED GREENER SOLUTIONS
DRIES INSTANTLY AND THAT ACHIEVES THE SAME SORT OF LIKE ADHESIVE GLUEY SUBSTANCE
US COMFORT AND JOY IN THE MOMENT BUT I'M NOT COMPLETELY SURE ABOUT THE COMFORT AS YOU'LL SEE IN A SECOND AND THE
AND SO TOXIC THAT IF AN ACTUAL BUTTERFLY HAD BEEN GOING IN THE LAB AT THE TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IN AN INSTANT SO THIS IS MY SECOND POINT ABOUT WHAT IS BIOMIMICRY AND WHAT IS NOT IF YOUR
THEY ARE CROSSLINKED TOGETHER BY HYDROGEN BONDS BUT THOSE ARE WEAK BONDS AND WHEN THEY ARE EXPOSED TO
NATURAL WATERPROOFING RESILIENT MATERIAL THAT IS ALSO ANTI MICROBIAL AND IT IS ACTIVATED JUST BY ENZYMES
KNOW THAT IS THE INDICATION THAT WE ALL REALIZE WE LIVE WITH TOXIC CHEMICALS EVERY DAY BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT WE THINK WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THINGS
IN NATURE MAGAZINE AS BEING INSPIRED BY THE BUTTERFLY YOU CAN SEE IN
BROKE THE WATER APART INTO TINY LITTLE PARTS WHICH CREATED A MORE EFFECTIVE WATER REPELLENT SURFACE
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS QUESTION THIS IS THE BIOLOGIZED QUESTION HOW DOES NATURE CROSSLINK
IF YOU'RE NOT A BIOLOGIST YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW HOW TO GO TO THE LITERATURE AND LOOK UP THIS
PROBLEM IS NOT SO MUCH JUST ABOUT THE SHEER VOLUME OF STUFF THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER TALK
AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT USES FORMALDEHYDE FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW FORMALDEHYDE HAS BEEN LINKED TO CANCER SPECIFICALLY LEUKEMIA IT IS AN ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO MESS WITH YOUR HORMONES IT IS A
NATURE HAS SOLVED MOST OF THE DESIGN PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE JUST NEED TO LOOK
THE SLUG IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT FORMALDEHYDE IS DOING THAT'S WHAT YOU DESCRIBED RIGHT GLUE SO IF I GET ALL THOSE
ADHESIVES AND COLOR AND SEE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY CREATE A HEALTHY INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM
THAT FUNCTION AGAIN IS CROSSLINKING SO WHAT WE TRYING TO DO NOW IS FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ACHIEVE CROSSLINKING
WAS THAT THE MATERIAL THAT THEY USED TO CREATE IT WERE THESE CA PERFLUORINATED CHEMICALS WHICH WERE
LET ME FIRST TELL YOU HOW A WRINKLE FORMS THIS YOUR LITTLE TECHNICAL LESSON FOR TODAY SO PRETEND THESE ARE YOUR FIBERS IN
TO KEEP OXYGEN OUT ANOTHER ONE TO DEAL WITH OILS ANOTHER ONE TO COLOR IT GREEN
PAINT BUT THE DUST IS STILL HAPPENING THE DUST IS COMING IN AND IS COATING OUR FLOORS IT'S COATING OUR TOYS AND THEN TOYS
IS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ABOUT 1 8 BILLION NEW PEOPLE ENTERING THE MIDDLE CLASS
HOW DOES NATURE CREATE COLOR HOW DOES IN THIS CASE NATURE CROSSLINK NOT WITH WEAK
MANY OF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY SHARED THEIR TEARS OR THEIR STORIES WITH SOMEONE ELSE
MY DISLIKE OF WORDS MADE ME EXCEL IN THE BETTER SUBJECTS SUCH AS PHYSICS MATHEMATICS AND CHEMISTRY
WELL WHEN I STARTED THIS PROJECT I REALLY HAD NO CLUE WHAT A TEAR WOULD LOOK LIKE UNDERNEATH THE MICROSCOPE
BUT ONE DAY I HAD TO CRY I BUMPED MY TOE AGAINST THE TABLE REALLY HARD
AND MAN I FEEL LUCKY THAT I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE BIRTH
SO WHILE IN PAIN
I CAPTURED A
BUT LET'S GET BACK TO TEARS PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME HOW DO YOU CREATE THESE IMAGES
TO TURN YOUR TEAR INTO ART BECAUSE JUST LIKE IDEAS WORTH SPREADING I BELIEVE IN TEARS WORTH SHEDDING
TEARS ARE UNIQUE THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THEY ARE ART SO HOW IN THE WORLD DID I COME UP WITH PUTTING TEARS UNDERNEATH THE
I REALLY HAD NO CLUE WHAT TECHNIQUE I SHOULD USE UNDERNEATH MY MICROSCOPE SO I STARTED WITH THE BRIGHT FIELD
OR THE TEAR OF COMPLETE FRUSTRATION FROM MY SISTER BECAUSE HER
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF TEARS THAT THE WORLD'S MONO TEAR IS THE EMOTIONAL TEAR IT REACTS BOTH TO POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE SADNESS HAPPINESS PLEASURE OR PAIN
ILLUMINATION LOOK AT HOW THE TEAR SHAPES IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PLANET AND
IS IN REMISSION OR THE TEAR OF HAPPINESS WHEN YOU FINALLY FIGURE OUT YOU'RE PREGNANT AFTER YEARS OF TRYING OR
FOR A LAPTOP AND A CAMERA I JOINED THE ROYAL ART ACADEMY IN THE HAGUE AND BECAME A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER
DATES WHICH I ACTUALLY STILL DO SO IT DIDN'T COME AS A MAJOR SURPRISE THAT I BECAME A MEDICAL LABORATORY ANALYST WHILE WORKING AT THE LAB I SPENT A LOT OF
ACCORDING TO RESEARCH WOMEN CRY AN AVERAGE FIVE
SO NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO MAKE TEAR VISIBLE BUT IT DID NOT EXPLAIN WHY IT LOOKED LIKE THAT
OF TEARS AN ONGOING PHOTOGRAPHY TEAR COLLECTION WITH PERSONAL STORIES AT ITS HEART IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT
YOU TO DONATE YOUR TEAR TODAY YOU CAN FIND ME DOWNSTAIRS AT THE LOBBY AND I WILL VISUALIZE YOUR TEAR UNDERNEATH THE MICROSCOPE
WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN STORY TO SHARE AND THERE ARE SO MANY MORE
EACH TEARS TURNS OUT SO DIFFERENTLY WELL LET'S HAVE A LOOK UNDERNEATH THE
STORY STARTERS SINCE EVERYTHING I VISUALIZE HAS A HIDDEN STORY
AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW ME AS THE TEAR CATCHER
THE BOOKS BUT ALSO
IT'S RECORDED IN THE THINGS THAT WE CREATE AND WE USE THE TOOLS THAT WE USE
THE BUILDINGS THAT WE LIVE IN AND LEARN IN AND
ENJOY
THESE ARE PART OF OUR MATERIAL CULTURE IT'S PART OF WHAT
THE PRESENT COMES IN CONFLICT WITH THE PAST I THINK OF AN EXAMPLE DOWN ON ROCHESTER ROAD JUST SOUTH OF AVON ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE ROAD THERE
IT UNATTENDED FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS AND LEFT THE
ACTUALLY TAKING THE HOUSE ITSELF AND
NOT JUST RANDOM WORDS THEY'RE STRUNG TOGETHER IN A CERTAIN WAY JUST AS OUR HISTORY IS STRUNG TOGETHER IN CERTAIN WAYS
COULDN'T STAND TO LIVE THERE HE WAS RIPPING THE PAGES OUT OF THE
WAIT THREE HUNDRED YEARS AND IT WILL GROW BACK BUT WHEN YOU DESTROY NON RENEWABLE
YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE PIECES WILL SURVIVE
IN MUSEUMS OR COLLECTIONS OR ANTIQUE SHOPS
BUT THEY LOSE THEIR CONTEXT THEIR LITTLE WORDS THEY'RE NO LONGER SENTENCES
AND PARAGRAPHS AND THOUGHTS THAT REALLY
AND HE WENT
IN TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND SAID I'D LIKE TO DEVELOP THIS AREA HERE'S AN IDEA
HE
GOT PERMISSION FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT
AND THE FIRST
DAY AFTER THE EVENING MEETING SAID YOU'VE GOT IT
HE WENT IN HE TORE DOWN THE HAY BARN
HE TORE DOWN THE CORN CRIB
HE TORE DOWN THE CHICKEN COOP HE TORE DOWN THE MACHINE SHOP HE TORE DOWN THE PIGPENS
BUT HE DID LEAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL BIG
TWO STORY WHITE MANSION IN THE BACK SHE'S NODDING HER HEAD YES I REMEMBER THAT BEAUTIFUL BUILDING
BUT HE SAVED THAT BIG BUILDING BECAUSE HE NAMED
THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BEHIND IT
HE GAVE IT A NAME
HEDGINGTON ESTATES
HMM NICE NAME
NICE NAME
BUT WHAT HE DID
IS HE HAD
19TH CENTURY FARMSTEAD AND
A FARMSTEAD IS THE WHOLE COMPLEX THAT
PRODUCES THE FOOD THAT WE EAT
BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE
BUT A DEVELOPER CAME ALONG
ROCHESTER ROAD LOT OF PEOPLE LOT OF TRAFFIC HMM
I COULD MAKE ANOTHER STRIP MALL THERE
JUST WHAT WE NEED
SO HE BOUGHT THE
LIKE ABOUT THE BOOKS IS
I LOVE THE INK
ON THE PAPER
I LOVE THE
LETTERS THAT FORM WORDS
AND THE WORDS THAT FORM SENTENCES AND THE SENTENCES THAT
FORM PARAGRAPHS THE PARAGRAPHS MAKE CHAPTERS
AND THEN THESE ARE STRUNG TOGETHER IN A SEQUENCE
WE AT LEAST SAVE A SAMPLE I LOVE NATURE TOO AND WHEN I EXPERIENCE OR SEE A FOREST FIRE I AM TRULY SADDENED
GAVE US NATURAL RESOURCES BUT HUMANS GAVE US CULTURAL RESOURCES AND THESE CULTURAL RESOURCES ARE THE THINGS THAT WE SURROUND OURSELVES WITH AND THAT WE USE
THE HISTORY BOOK OF OUR LOCAL HISTORY AND THEN WHEN HE WENT IN HE SAID WELL I DON'T NEED THAT CHICKEN COOP
US IT'S WHAT WE ANTHROPOLOGISTS REFER TO AS MATERIAL CULTURE OR CULTURAL RESOURCES CULTURAL RESOURCES NOW
WHAT'S ONE THING ONE THING THAT YOU WOULD ATTRIBUTE TO YOUR SUCCESS DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT RICHARD SAID HE
MOST EMPLOYEES DREAD IT IN MINDVALLEY A WEEKLY MEETING IS CALLED THE AWESOMENESS REPORT
ANYONE ELSE AND THANK THEM FOR SOMETHING GREAT THEY'VE DONE THE 8000
AND TALK ABOUT WHY THEY WON THE AWARD IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO SEE PEOPLE LITERALLY
A NEW MODEL THAT MAKES THE EXISTING MODEL OBSOLETE WE
PRAISES OR LOVE LETTERS JUST WENT OUT LAST WEEK IMAGINE COMING TO WORK WHERE THREE TO FOUR TIMES A WEEK THERE'S A LITTLE LOVE LETTER WAITING FOR YOU ON YOUR COMPUTER WITH A BADGE AUSTIN POWER FOR KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE MOJO OR BORA FOR KNOWING THAT YOU DO THINGS VERY
THE SECRET SOCIETY FOR PLATONIC LOVE APPRECIATION SMILES AND HAPPINESS
IT'S LIKE THE CIA WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION NOBODY IN MINDVALLEY KNOWS WHO'S MEMBER OF SPLASH BUT THESE MEMBERS HAVE A SECRET BUDGET TO DO FUNKY COOL THINGS FOR THE COMPANY YOU MIGHT SHOW UP TO WORK ONE DAY AND SPLASH HAS ORGANIZED
GOES THROUGH IT BECOMES PUBLIC EVERYBODY KNOWS THE QUESTION HAS BEEN ASKED THEY JUST DON'T KNOW BY WHOM THE FOUNDER OR THE MANAGER HAS TO ANSWER IT SO EVERYONE IS
STAND UP COMEDY ACT PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING PEOPLE JOYFUL IT'S TON OF FUN OUR AWESOMENESS REPORTS ARE RATHER LIKE WATCHING THE DAILY SHOW AND ANOTHER THING THAT WE DO
{NS} I FLEW HERE ACTUALLY FROM NECKER ISLAND NECKER ISLAND IS THE PRIVATE ISLAND OF SIR RICHARD BRANSON MY WIFE MY SON AND
COFFEE FOR EVERYONE OR BOUGHT A LATEST NEW TECH TOY FOR OUR COMPUTER TEAM ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT SPLASH DOES IS IT ORGANIZES SPONTANEOUS FESTIVALS THEY MIGHT BE
STARTED IT WAS A SHADY APARTMENT IN TIME SQUARE IN FACT TWO YEARS BEFORE I MOVED THERE IT WAS A THAI MASSAGE
QUESTION I HAD TO ANSWER TO MY TEAM JUST FEW WEEKS AGO
GREAT WORK MAKING IT FUN THEN STEPPING BACK AND LEAVING THEM ALONE SO YOU CAN FOCUS ON YOUR VISION BUT HERE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING MAKE THEIR

I AM NOT READY FOR A DRIVERLESS
PRETTY GOOD IT FEELS PRETTY COMFORTABLE WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU SAW THE CHINA TRIP LAST WEEK AND THE
TERRORISM REFUGEES AND THE REST DOES THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST FALL APART NO THE KURDS WILL DO BETTER AND IRAQ ISRAEL IRAN OVER TIME BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT A GOOD LOOK
SO GLOBALIZATION IS CONTINUING GOODS AND SERVICES AND PEOPLE AND CAPITAL MOVING ACROSS BORDERS FASTER AND FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE
IS THAT WE DO NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS AND IN FOUR YEARS TIME YOU INVITE ME BACK AND I WILL GIVE THIS SPEECH YET AGAIN
THERE YOU SEE AND THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT A
I CAN TELL YOU IN A G ZERO WORLD ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS ARE INCREASINGLY NOT TRUE AND SO FAILED
IS A PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES GOD KNOWS WE KNOW IT HERE IN NEW YORK BUT IT'S A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM IN EUROPE THAN THE US IT'S A MUCH BIGGER
ABSENT CRISIS
WE NEED
TO SEE THAT THE
HOLLOWING OUT THE INEQUALITY THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE GROWING AND GROWING IN THE UNITED STATES ARE THEMSELVES URGENT ENOUGH
TO FORCE OUR LEADERS TO CHANGE AND THAT WE HAVE THOSE VOICES
THROUGH OUR CELL PHONES INDIVIDUALLY WE HAVE THOSE VOICES TO COMPEL THEM TO CHANGE
THERE IS OF COURSE THIRD CHOICE
PERHAPS THE MOST LIKELY ONE
AMERICANIZATION AND GLOBALIZATION FOR THE LAST SEVERAL GENERATIONS HAVE BASICALLY BEEN THE SAME
IS NOT SO IF I'VE
DON'T WANT TO SEE IT PARTICULARLY
AND WE HAVE AN ENERGY REVOLUTION
WHERE WE DON'T NEED OPEC OR THE MIDDLE EAST THE WAY WE USED TO WE PRODUCE ALL THAT RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SO THE AMERICANS DON'T WANT
TO BE THE GLOBAL SHERIFF FOR SECURITY OR THE ARCHITECT OF GLOBAL TRADE THE AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO EVEN BE THE CHEERLEADER OF GLOBAL VALUES WELL THEN
JUST WAIT UNTIL THE CHINESE PUT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EVERY COUNTRY AROUND RUSSIA THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD INFLUENCE IN THE
OF MIDDLE AND WORKING CLASSES THAT FEEL LIKE THEY'VE NOT BENEFITED FROM PROMISES OF GLOBALIZATION
ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD I'LL GO AROUND IT AND THEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN NEW YORK SO WHY WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS
BUT ONLY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE AND THEY WANT THEIR OWN VALUES STANDARDS CURRENCY IN COMPETITION WITH THAT OF THE US
IT WAS 90 MINUTES LONG AND THEY TALKED ABOUT SYRIA THAT'S WHAT PUTIN WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HE'S INCREASINGLY CALLING THE SHOTS HE'S THE ONE WILLING TO DO STUFF THERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MUTUAL LIKE OR TRUST BUT IT'S NOT AS IF THE AMERICANS ARE TELLING HIM WHAT TO
IMPORTANT ECONOMIES IN ASIA NOW LOOK THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN ASIA WE SEE THE SPARRING OVER THE SOUTH CHINA SEA WE SEE THAT KIM JONG UN JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS TESTED YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR WEAPON BUT
THE LEADERS IN ASIA DO NOT FEEL THE NEED TO WAVE THE FLAG TO GO XENOPHOBIC TO ACTUALLY ALLOW ESCALATION OF THE GEOPOLITICAL AND CROSS BORDER TENSIONS THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON LONG TERM ECONOMIC STABILITY AND GROWTH
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING
NEED TO ONLY OUTRUN YOUR FELLOW CAMPERS
NOW I JUST TOLD YOU
ABOUT OUR FELLOW CAMPERS
RIGHT AND FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE
WE LOOK OK A
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THAT CONTEXT SAY LET'S GO DOLLAR
LET'S GO NEW YORK REAL ESTATE LET'S SEND OUR KIDS TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES YOU KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS ARE AWESOME CANADA MEXICO AND TWO BIG BODIES OF WATER YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TURKEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE NEIGHBORS LIKE THAT
THOSE ARE AWESOME NEIGHBORS
ON THE TARMAC NO RED CARPET KIND OF LEFT OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE PLANE ALONG WITH ALL THE MEDIA AND EVERYBODY ELSE LATER
RIGHT I MEAN THE TURKS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONLY 10000 SYRIAN REFUGEES THE JORDANIANS THE GERMANS THE
THESE ARE FACTORS OF LARGE MAGNITUDE WE JUST ACCEPTED 10000 SYRIAN REFUGEES AND WE'RE COMPLAINING BITTERLY ABOUT IT YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SWIM
LONG TERM I DIDN'T MEAN THAT BUT LONG TERM
ZERO WORLD IT IS ABSOLUTELY AN AMAZING TIME FOR A FEW AFRICAN COUNTRIES THOSE GOVERNED WELL WITH A LOT OF URBANIZATION A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE WOMEN REALLY GETTING INTO THE WORKFORCE ENTREPRENEURSHIP TAKING OFF BUT FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRIES IN AFRICA IT'S GOING TO BE LOT MORE DICEY EXTREME CLIMATE CONDITIONS RADICALISM BOTH FROM ISLAM AND ALSO CHRISTIANITY VERY POOR GOVERNANCE BORDERS YOU CAN'T DEFEND LOTS OF FORCED MIGRATION THOSE COUNTRIES CAN FALL OFF THE MAP SO YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO SEE AN EXTREME SEGREGATION GOING ON BETWEEN THE WINNERS AND THE LOSERS ACROSS AFRICA
TEDX YOU ALWAYS THINK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THE WORLD CHANGING BECOMING MORE INNOVATIVE YOU THINK ABOUT THE DRIVERLESS
ARE WE PREPARED TO TRULY LEAD BY EXAMPLE WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TO DO TO FIX THIS AFTER NOVEMBER
WE FINALLY SEE A NEW LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT ELECTED THERE
THE ONLY PLACE YOU SEE THAT IS MOVING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION IS THE UNPOPULARITY OF MEXICAN PRESIDENT PE A NIETO THERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE SLIP AWAY FROM THE UNITED STATES OVER THE COMING YEARS THE US ELECTION MATTERS A LOT ON THAT ONE TOO
STATES WE SPENT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS ON WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN THAT WERE FAILED WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE WE HAVE
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE
IN A G ZERO WORLD THE WAY YOU LEAD
IS BY EXAMPLE
IF WE KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE GLOBAL COP ANYMORE IF WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE ARCHITECT OF GLOBAL TRADE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE CHEERLEADER OF GLOBAL VALUES WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT THE WAY WE USED TO THE 21ST CENTURY IS CHANGING WE NEED TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE BE SO COMPELLING THAT ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STILL SAY IT'S NOT JUST THEY'RE FASTER CAMPERS EVEN WHEN THE BEAR IS NOT CHASING US THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE WE WANT TO EMULATE THEM
THE ELECTION PROCESS THIS YEAR IS NOT PROVING A GOOD OPTION
FOR LEADING BY EXAMPLE
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THE 90S WE CAN STILL BE THAT CHEERLEADER ON VALUES WE CAN STILL BE THE ARCHITECT OF GLOBAL TRADE WE CAN STILL BE THE GLOBAL
WANTS TO BRING US BACK TO THE 30S HE'S SAYING OUR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY YOU DON'T LIKE IT LUMP IT RIGHT
HAVE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CAPABILITIES DIFFERENT SOCIAL STABILITY AND DIFFERENT POLITICAL PREFERENCES AND SYSTEMS THAN CORE EUROPE SO EUROPE WAS ABLE TO TRULY EXPAND UNDER THE G7
BUT UNDER THE G ZERO EUROPE WILL GET SMALLER CORE EUROPE AROUND GERMANY AND
AND OTHERS WILL STILL WORK BE FUNCTIONAL STABLE WEALTHY INTEGRATED BUT THE PERIPHERY COUNTRIES LIKE GREECE AND TURKEY AND OTHERS WILL NOT LOOK THAT GOOD AT ALL
ONE IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY WE'RE NUMBER ONE THE UNITED STATES IS LARGE AND IN CHARGE
RIGHT ONE IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF MILITARY SECURITY BY THE US AND ALLIES NUMBER TWO IT WAS EASY TO TAKE A LOT OF CHEAP MONEY OUT OF THE GROUND BECAUSE OIL WAS EXPENSIVE AND NUMBER THREE WAS NO MATTER HOW BAD THE LEADERS WERE THE POPULATIONS WERE RELATIVELY QUIESCENT
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY AND MANY DIDN'T HAVE THE WILL TO REALLY RISE UP AGAINST
YOU LOOK TO EUROPE
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ALLIANCE IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP BUT IT IS NOW WEAKER THAN IT HAS BEEN AT ANY POINT SINCE WORLD WAR II ALL OF THE CRISES THE BREXIT CONVERSATIONS THE HEDGING GOING ON BETWEEN THE FRENCH AND THE RUSSIANS OR THE GERMANS AND THE TURKS OR THE BRITS AND THE CHINESE
THAT
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET BECAUSE THEY SAY WASHINGTON'S BROKEN WE DON'T TRUST THE ESTABLISHMENT WE HATE THE MEDIA HECK EVEN GLOBALISTS LIKE ME
ARE TAKING IT ON THE CHIN LOOK
I DO THINK
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE MY FELLOW CAMPERS THAT WHEN YOU ARE BEING CHASED BY THE BEAR
IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT YOU NEED NOT OUTRUN THE BEAR
EUROPEAN SHORES
YOU SEE BREXIT AND YOU SEE THE CONCERNS OF POPULISM ACROSS
ALL OF THE EUROPEAN STATES
LET ME TELL YOU THAT OVER THE LONG TERM IN A G ZERO WORLD EUROPEAN EXPANSION WILL BE SEEN TO HAVE GONE TOO FAR
EUROPE WENT RIGHT UP TO RUSSIA WENT RIGHT DOWN TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND IF THE WORLD WERE TRULY BECOMING MORE FLAT AND MORE AMERICANIZED THAT WOULD BE LESS OF PROBLEM BUT IN A G ZERO WORLD THOSE COUNTRIES NEAREST RUSSIA AND NEAREST THE MIDDLE EAST
GETTING OBJECTIVELY HARDER FOR THE AMERICANS TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL EVEN HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE ON THE GLOBAL ORDER
TO DOMINATE IT THE RUSSIANS ARE PICKING UP THE CRUMBS IN A G ZERO WORLD THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY TENSE 10 YEARS
WANT TO DO MORE LEADERSHIP YOU SEE THAT IN UKRAINE
IN THE BALTIC STATES IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT NOT WITH THE AMERICANS THEY WANT THEIR OWN PREFERENCES AND ORDER THAT'S WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE SO WHAT HAPPENS GOING FORWARD LET'S START EASY
WITH THE MIDDLE
THE WHOLE 20 ARE GETTING TOGETHER SURELY WHEN THE LEADERS ARE ALL ONSTAGE THEN THE
HOW ABOUT A DRIVERLESS WORLD AND I ASK YOU THAT BECAUSE WE ARE INCREASINGLY
LATIN AMERICA
A LOT OF POPULISM MADE THE ECONOMIES NOT GO SO WELL THEY HAD BEEN MORE OPPOSED TO THE UNITED STATES FOR DECADES INCREASINGLY THEY'RE COMING BACK
WE SEE THAT IN ARGENTINA
WE SEE IT WITH THE OPENNESS IN CUBA WE WILL SEE IT IN VENEZUELA WHEN MADURO FALLS WE WILL SEE IT IN BRAZIL AFTER THE IMPEACHMENT
OF THIS TRAINING ONLY 26 OF THE PARTICIPATING HEALTH PROVIDERS FELT CONFIDENT TO PROVIDE CARE FOR SURVIVORS BUT BY THE END OF THIS TRAINING
THE LACK OF GUIDELINES IN 2014 A
FEW MORE COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN ARE NOW REQUESTING SUPPORT TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES AND CARRY OUT TRAININGS
BUT THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH THERE IS STILL RESISTANCE WORLDWIDE AND TOO MANY GIRLS LIKE LILY IN THE WORLD
SO HERE IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO
HEALTH POLICY MAKERS WE NEED YOU TO PRIORITIZE VAWG IN YOUR BUDGETS WE NEED YOU TO IMPLEMENT TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT GUIDELINES IN YOUR COUNTRIES
MY FORMER MEDICAL SCHOOL HAS INTRODUCED VAWG INTO THEIR CURRICULUM SINCE WE
I FEEL DEEPLY SORRY THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO DO MORE
THIS WAS A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR ME
IT BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THE GAPS IN MEDICAL RESPONSE AROUND THE WORLD
LILY'S STORY IS NOT UNIQUE
THIS IS HAPPENING IN ALL COUNTRIES INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN THE USA
COMMUNITY LEADERS WORKED WITH BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
TO LEARN TO EQUALIZE POWER DYNAMICS OVER THREE YEARS
CUT A WOMAN'S RISK OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE FROM HER PARTNER BY HALF
THIS IS THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF EDUCATION
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ARE VACCINATED AND ARE INVOLVED IN THE CURE THIS WORKS IN UGANDA A
I HAVE THE SAME GOAL AS I HAD
WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD
WHICH TAKES ME TO THE NEXT TOPIC
WHAT IS LIFE
WE KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEFINE WHAT IT IS
WE KNOW WHAT IS MEANT WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING IS ALIVE
BUT REMEMBER THAT
SO THESE ARE THE TWO THINGS AMONG SOME OTHER FACTORS THAT DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN HAVE LIFE ON A PLANET
SO
I AM REALLY INTERESTED IN ONE BODY PARTICULARLY THIS ONE AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE PHOTO HERE
AND THIS ONE IS VERY SPECIAL
TARDIGRADE THAT I CAN'T PRONOUNCE BUT I CAN SHOW IT TO
16 KILOMETERS ABOVE OUR SURFACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE ACTUALLY
AND WHY IS THAT
WELL WE CAN TAKE JUPITER
AS AN EXAMPLE
JUPITER WORKS AS A
VACUUM CLEANER BASICALLY IT ATTRACTS ALL
BIG ASTEROIDS AND OTHER DANGEROUS BODIES THAT MIGHT COLLIDE WITH US AND DESTROY EVERYTHING HERE
WHY NOT I MEAN IT WILL BE POSSIBLE
FOR IT
SINCE IT IS ALIEN IT CAN SURVIVE IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS IT CAN BE EXPOSED TO RADIATION ABOUT 100 TIMES NECESSARY TO KILL US
AND ONE SIXTH OF ITS DNA
IS ALIEN BASICALLY
SO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY WHO KNOWS
SO NOW LET US STEP FURTHER TO ADVANCED LIFE
WHAT STANDS IN OUR WAY WHEN IT COMES TO
FINDING SOMETHING IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM OR SOMEWHERE ELSE
THE TWO MAIN REASONS TO WHY WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING IS THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN THE BODIES
AND THE TECHNOLOGY WE ARE HAVING TODAY
LET US LOOK AT THE DISTANCE
THE CLOSEST STAR SYSTEM TO US
ALPHA CENTAURI
IS 4 3 LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM US OKAY
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE BUT IT
AND EACH OF THEM HAS SOME MILLIONS OR
IS ALWAYS THERE OF COURSE
MAYBE OUR MEASUREMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN SENSITIVE ENOUGH
MAYBE WE HAVE MISSED
THE SIGNAL FROM AN ALIEN LIFE
OR MAYBE SOMETHING DIFFERENT WE'RE CONTACTING A PLANET
THAT HAS LIFE BUT IT IS NOT EVOLVED ENOUGH AND IT CANNOT
CONTACT US BACK
OF COURSE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE WE SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE SEARCH
IF WE REALLY WANT TO FIND
OUT IF WE ARE ALONE OR NOT IN THE UNIVERSE
SO FOR NOW
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND SOMETHING A ROBOT TO A DISTANT PLANET
SO WHAT WE ARE DONG RIGHT NOW IS TO USE INSTRUMENTS INSTEAD
ONE EXAMPLE IS THE RADIO TELESCOPE
A RADIO TELESCOPE CAN SEND
RADIO SIGNALS TO A DISTANT PLANET AND HOPEFULLY GET
AN ANSWER BACK
AND THESE SIGNALS CAN TRAVEL IN GREAT DISTANCES AND CARRY A LOT OF INFORMATION
ANOTHER THING THAT WE ARE USING RIGHT NOW THAT IS REALLY GREAT IS THE TELESCOPE
FOR NOW WE HAVE FOUND MORE THAN A THOUSAND EXOPLANETS THAT IS PLANETS
OUTSIDE OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN DUE TO SIZE
SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT IT IS ONLY DUE TO SIZE PLANETS OUTSIDE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
NO IT IS JUST MUCH EASIER TO FIND BIGGER PLANETS
THAN SMALLER
BUT WE HAVE FOUND ABOUT 20 SO CALLED SUPER EARTHS THAT IS PLANETS
THAT ARE
SYSTEM IT WOULD TAKE US MORE THAN 150 THOUSAND YEARS TO REACH THAT SYSTEM SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US UNFORTUNATELY BUT WHAT WE WILL DO IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE WANT
AND LET THE SATELLITES COLLECT THE SAMPLES INSTEAD
WELL
OF COURSE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN THESE COMFORT ZONES ASTRONOMERS I UNDERSTAND THEM BUT
YOU HAVE TO
TRY A LITTLE HARDER
OR ELSE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUCCEED
SO AFTER THAT
DAY I REALIZED HOW MUCH WORK AND HOW MUCH
ENERGY THERE IS BEHIND A SPACE MISSION YOU DON'T KNOW A PERCENTAGE OF IT ACTUALLY WE DON'T READ PERCENTAGE OF IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS
AND I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SOMEDAY FIND SOMETHING VERY SOON ACTUALLY 10 20 50 YEARS I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT IS MANY YEARS BUT IN ASTRONOMICAL TERMS IT IS NOTHING BASICALLY
I WAS SO SCARED BECAUSE
ALL OF THE ATTENDANTS WERE ACTUALLY ASTRONOMERS THEY WERE BASICALLY EXPERTS IN THIS I
WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD CRITICIZE ME FOR EVERYTHING IN DETAIL
AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY KIND OF COURSE AND WE BRAINSTORMED A LITTLE AND I GOT SOME NEW
BODIES
AND THE WATER IN OUR BODIES AS WELL
CAME FROM THE STARS
THEREFORE EVERY MATTER WE KNOW
OF COURSE COMES FROM THE STARS
SO I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 13
BODY OR OBSERVE A BODY
WILL BE TO SEND A ROBOT
TO THAT PLANET OR
MOON OR WHATEVER WE ARE INTERESTED IN
BECAUSE A ROBOT HAS THE ABILITY TO TRAVEL IN GREAT DISTANCES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AND IF IT IS INTELLIGENT IT CAN FIX ITSELF
AND SO
ON SO WHAT
HAPPENS IF WE DON'T RECEIVE ANYTHING
NOT A SINGLE SIGNAL FROM SOMEWHERE
DOES IT MEAN THAT WE ARE ALONE
NO ACTUALLY NOT
WELL THIS IS
WILL
PERMIT A PLANET OR BODY TO SUSTAIN AN ATMOSPHERE AND LIQUID WATER SO EARTH IS IN THAT ZONE MERCURY IS NOT AND PLUTO IS NOT
AND THIS DISTANCE
DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE STAR SO
IF THE STARS ARE REALLY BIG OF COURSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM HAS TO INCREASE AS
LEAVE THE STAGE I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND I SAW THE CRATERS OF THE MOON FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH MY OWN TELESCOPE
AND THE THINGS THAT I FELT THAT DAY WAS JUST INCREDIBLE I WAS ACTUALLY SCARED
TO LOOK AT THE CRATERS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO STRANGE I HAD NEVER SEEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE
AND I WANT YOU ALL TO GO TO AN OBSERVATORY OR EVEN BUY YOUR OWN TELESCOPE
AND JUST OBSERVE THE NIGHT SKY BECAUSE I WILL PROMISE YOU THAT
YOU WILL FEEL THE SAME THING THAT I FELT THE FIRST TIME
WHEN YOU SEE THE RINGS OF SATURN OR THE MOONS OF JUPITER OR EVEN A GALAXY I'LL PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THAT FEELING BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN THESE MORE THAN HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND THEY STILL AMAZE ME AND THAT IS MAYBE WHY I CONTINUE WITH
DO WE KNOW THAT THAT LIFE IS FROM THE PLANET IT IS OBSERVING AND NOT FROM
WELL IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM ACTUALLY AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ALWAYS IS A PASSENGER THAT SURVIVES THIS
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BUILDING THE SPACECRAFTS
IN
SO WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR LIFE TO EXIST SOMEWHERE
THERE ARE ACTUALLY MANY FACTORS THAT DECIDE WHETHER A PLANET CAN HAVE LIFE OR NOT FOR INSTANCE
WHY ISN'T MERCURY OR PLUTO FULL OF CREATURES LIKE HERE ON EARTH
AND NOW WHOEVER WAS OUTSIDE WOULD NEITHER IDENTIFY HIMSELF NOR GO AWAY SO MY FATHER TRIED TO GET THE POLICE ON THE PHONE
BUT PERHAPS TERRIFIED BY THE RISING TIDE OF ARMED EXTREMISM THAT HAD ALREADY CLAIMED THE LIVES OF SO MANY ALGERIAN OFFICERS
THEY DIDN'T EVEN ANSWER
WHAT HE CALLED THE TERRORISTS' RADICAL BREAK WITH THE TRUE ISLAM AS IT WAS LIVED BY OUR ANCESTORS THESE WERE WORDS THAT COULD GET YOU KILLED
MEET HER IN HER OFFICE IN HERAT SHE ENTERS SURROUNDED BY FOUR LARGE MEN WITH FOUR HUGE GUNS
A MONOLITH OUT THERE CALLED MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISM THAT IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THESE MOVEMENTS ALSO HAVE THEIR DIVERSITIES SOME USE AND ADVOCATE VIOLENCE SOME DO NOT THOUGH THEY'RE OFTEN INTERRELATED THEY TAKE DIFFERENT
MINUTES ABOUT FUNDAMENTALISM AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN I CITE THE DEFINITION GIVEN BY THE ALGERIAN SOCIOLOGIST MARIEME HELIE LUCAS AND SHE SAYS THAT
AND I REMEMBER THINKING IN THAT MOMENT THAT THE BOMBERS MADE HEADLINES HERE TWO YEARS
ANY CASE SOMEONE WOULD RETURN A FEW MONTHS LATER AND LEAVE A NOTE ON DAD'S KITCHEN TABLE WHICH SIMPLY SAID CONSIDER YOURSELF DEAD SUBSEQUENTLY ALGERIA'S FUNDAMENTALIST ARMED GROUPS WOULD MURDER AS MANY AS 200000
BUT IN ANY CASE THESE ARE ALL RADICAL PROJECTS THEY'RE NOT CONSERVATIVE OR TRADITIONAL APPROACHES THEY'RE MOST OFTEN ABOUT CHANGING PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ISLAM RATHER THAN PRESERVING IT WHAT
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT TELLING THESE COUNTER STEREOTYPICAL STORIES OF PEOPLE OF MUSLIM HERITAGE WHO HAVE CONFRONTED THE FUNDAMENTALISTS AND BEEN THEIR PRIMARY VICTIMS IS ALSO A GREAT WAY OF COUNTERING THAT DISCRIMINATION
SO NOW LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO FOUR PEOPLE WHOSE STORIES I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF
A FEW WEEKS AFTER I LEAVE AFGHANISTAN I SEE A HEADLINE ON THE INTERNET
AN AFGHAN PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED
I GOOGLE DESPERATELY AND THANKFULLY THAT DAY I FIND OUT THAT MARIA WAS NOT THE VICTIM THOUGH SADLY ANOTHER AFGHAN PROSECUTOR WAS GUNNED DOWN ON HIS WAY TO WORK
AND WHEN I HEAR HEADLINES LIKE THAT NOW
I THINK THAT AS INTERNATIONAL TROOPS LEAVE AFGHANISTAN THIS YEAR AND BEYOND WE MUST CONTINUE TO CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE THERE TO ALL OF THE MARIA
ABOUT ISLAM IS INHERENTLY FUNDAMENTALIST AND THIS IS JUST OFFENSIVE AND WRONG BUT UNFORTUNATELY ON THE LEFT ONE SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERS A DISCOURSE THAT IS TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM OF MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISM AT
RIGHTS LOVING OR FEMINIST WE MUST OPPOSE THESE MOVEMENTS AND SUPPORT THEIR GRASSROOTS
AS FAIZAN SAID AT THE TIME IF WE BOW DOWN TO THE ISLAMISTS WE'LL JUST BE SITTING IN A DARK CORNER
IN FACT MANY PEOPLE OF MUSLIM HERITAGE AROUND THE WORLD ARE STAUNCH OPPONENTS BOTH OF FUNDAMENTALISM AND OF TERRORISM AND OFTEN FOR VERY GOOD REASON
HE ORGANIZED A RAMADAN BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT IN MINNEAPOLIS IN RESPONSE
SCORES OF SOMALI AMERICAN KIDS CAME OUT TO EMBRACE SPORT DESPITE THE FATWA AGAINST IT
THEY PLAYED BASKETBALL AS BURHAN HASSAN NEVER WOULD AGAIN
PEOPLE NEED OUR SUPPORT TO SUCCEED IN THE WEST IT'S OFTEN ASSUMED THAT MUSLIMS GENERALLY CONDONE TERRORISM SOME ON THE RIGHT THINK THIS BECAUSE THEY VIEW MUSLIM CULTURE AS INHERENTLY
WHY DOES SHE CONTINUE
SHE SAYS WITH A SMILE THAT THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT EVERYONE ASKS
AS SHE PUTS IT WHY YOU RISK NOT LIVING
AND IT IS SIMPLY THAT FOR HER A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL THE MARIA BASHIRS TO COME IS WORTH THE RISK
AND SHE KNOWS THAT IF PEOPLE LIKE HER DO NOT TAKE THE RISK THERE WILL BE NO BETTER FUTURE
CHANGE THAT AND SO I ASK YOU TO PLEASE HELP SHARE THESE STORIES THROUGH YOUR NETWORKS LOOK AGAIN AT AMEL ZENOUNE'S
I WOKE UP EARLY THAT MORNING IN DAD'S APARTMENT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ALGIERS
KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO COME HOME
SINCE THAT TIME MR BIHI WHO DIRECTS THE NO BUDGET SOMALI EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY CENTER HAS BEEN VOCALLY DENOUNCING THE RECRUITMENT
AND THE FAILURES OF GOVERNMENT AND SOMALI AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE ABUBAKAR AS SADDIQUE ISLAMIC CENTER WHERE HE BELIEVES HIS NEPHEW WAS RADICALIZED DURING YOUTH
VICTIMS RIGHTS ADVOCATE CHERIFA KHEDDAR TOLD ME IN ALGIERS IT IS NOT ENOUGH JUST TO BATTLE TERRORISM WE MUST ALSO CHALLENGE FUNDAMENTALISM BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALISM IS THE IDEOLOGY THAT MAKES THE BED OF THIS TERRORISM
SHOULD ANYTHING I SAY BE TAKEN AS A JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS LIKE THE MASS DEATH SENTENCES HANDED OUT IN EGYPT EARLIER THIS WEEK
BUT WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT WE MUST CHALLENGE THESE MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENTS BECAUSE THEY THREATEN HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS MUSLIM MAJORITY
26 1997 AMEL BOARDED THE BUS IN ALGIERS WHERE SHE WAS STUDYING TO GO HOME AND SPEND A RAMADAN EVENING WITH HER FAMILY
AND WOULD NEVER FINISH LAW SCHOOL
WHEN THE BUS REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF HER HOMETOWN IT WAS STOPPED AT CHECKPOINT MANNED BY MEN FROM THE ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP
BEFORE HER DEATH AMEL HAD SAID TO HER MOTHER OF HERSELF AND HER SISTERS
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO US INSHALLAH
GOD WILLING
BUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS YOU MUST KNOW THAT WE ARE DEAD FOR KNOWLEDGE
YOU AND FATHER MUST KEEP YOUR HEADS HELD HIGH
THE LOSS OF SUCH A YOUNG WOMAN IS UNFATHOMABLE
OUT HOW THEY FOUGHT FUNDAMENTALISM PEACEFULLY LIKE MY FATHER DID AND HOW THEY COPED WITH THE ATTENDANT RISKS
WAS A TIME WHEN THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN HAD COMMENCED THEIR SYSTEMATIC TARGETING OF GIRLS' SCHOOLS THAT WOULD CULMINATE IN THE ATTACK ON MALALA YOUSAFZAI
WHAT DID THE PEERZADAS DO IN THAT ENVIRONMENT
THEY STAGED GIRLS' SCHOOL THEATER
SO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING NAANG WAL WHICH WAS A MUSICAL IN THE PUNJABI LANGUAGE AND THE GIRLS OF LAHORE GRAMMAR SCHOOL PLAYED ALL THE PARTS THEY SANG AND DANCED THEY PLAYED THE MICE AND THE WATER BUFFALO AND I HELD MY BREATH WONDERING WOULD WE GET TO THE END OF THIS AMAZING SHOW
RISE OF JIHADIST VIOLENCE THEY BEGAN TO RECEIVE THREATS TO CALL OFF THEIR EVENTS WHICH THEY REFUSED TO HEED
AND SO A BOMBER STRUCK THEIR 2008 EIGHTH WORLD PERFORMING ARTS FESTIVAL IN LAHORE PRODUCING RAIN OF GLASS THAT FELL INTO THE VENUE INJURING NINE PEOPLE
IN PLACES LIKE NORTHERN NIGERIA WHERE JIHADIS STILL KILL STUDENTS THE TIME TO SPEAK UP IN SUPPORT OF ALL OF THOSE WHO PEACEFULLY CHALLENGE FUNDAMENTALISM AND TERRORISM IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES
IS TO SAVE THE RELIGION I LOVE FROM SMALL NUMBER OF EXTREMISTS
FAR AWAY IN THE AMERICAN MIDWEST I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF MEETING SOMALI AMERICANS WHO WERE WORKING TO COUNTER THE EFFORTS OF AL SHABAAB TO RECRUIT SMALL NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THEIR CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS TO TAKE PART IN ATROCITIES LIKE WESTGATE
DO KNOW THERE WAS A BOMB HERE YESTERDAY AND YOU DO KNOW THERE'S A THREAT HERE TODAY
AND SHE SAID I KNOW THAT BUT I CAME TO YOUR FESTIVAL WITH MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE AND I STILL HAVE THOSE IMAGES IN MY MIND
WE HAVE TO BE HERE
WITH STALWART AUDIENCES LIKE THIS THE PEERZADAS WERE ABLE TO CONCLUDE THEIR FESTIVAL ON SCHEDULE
2004 AND 2008 NO MORE THAN 15 PERCENT OF AL QAEDA'S VICTIMS WERE WESTERNERS
WHEN I LOOK BACK NOW I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE MOMENT THAT SET ME ON THE PATH WAS TO WRITING A BOOK CALLED YOUR FATWA DOES NOT APPLY
IN FACT AMEL'S SISTER LAMIA OVERCAME HER GRIEF WENT TO LAW SCHOOL AND PRACTICES AS A LAWYER IN ALGIERS TODAY SOMETHING WHICH IS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE ARMED FUNDAMENTALISTS WERE LARGELY DEFEATED IN THE COUNTRY
SETTINGS HEALTHCARE AND IN HOMELESS SHELTERS WE DO ARTIST TRAINING ACTIVITY SUPPORTING ARTISTRY IN YOUNG ARTISTS ALL THE WAY STARTING AT THE AGE OF 13 AND
AS LULLABY HAS EVOLVED IT'S ALSO BROADENED OUT AND THE FIRST LULLABY THAT YOU'LL HEAR IS CALLED THE EMPEROR OF
WE STARTED TO WONDER ABOUT LULLABIES
WE WONDERED WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THESE YOUNG WOMEN WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH ARTISTS
TO WRITE LULLABIES SPECIFICALLY FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND TO THEN HAVE A RECORDING OF THAT LULLABY
AS A GIFT AND AS SOMETHING THEY COULD USE TO BUILD THAT CONNECTION
WE PILOTED THE PROJECT AT JACOPI HOSPITAL IT WAS HUGELY SUCCESSFUL LULLABY HAS EVOLVED AND NOW TAKES PLACE IN NUMEROUS HEALTHCARE SETTINGS WE DO LULLABIES WITH HOMELESS SHELTERS
FIRST AND THEN YOU WILL HEAR A SONG BY SHAUNA KANTEEN A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS IN THE VERY FIRST PROJECT AT THE JACOBI HOSPITAL
OVER 20 YEARS HE WAS STAFFING A LULLABY PROJECT WORKING WITH SOME YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HE WROTE THESE EXTREMELY EMPOWERING LYRICS TO THIS SONG THE EMPEROR OF POSSIBILITY
{NS} I RAN THE WEILL MUSIC INSTITUTE AT CARNEGIE HALL WHICH IS THE HALL'S EDUCATION AND SOCIAL IMPACT PROGRAM'S ARM WE WORK ANNUALLY WITH ABOUT 600000 PEOPLE
WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT PARTNERSHIP MIGHT EVOLVE
WE WERE IN A ROOM WITH DOCTORS AND NURSES AND STAFF FROM JACOBI SOME OF OUR STAFF AND SOME ARTISTS AND WE WERE HEARING ABOUT DIFFERENT MEDICAL CHALLENGES THE HOSPITAL WAS FACING
A WOMAN STARTED TALKING ABOUT PREGNANT TEENAGERS
AND SHE SAID THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN WERE NOT REALLY READY TO HAVE CHILDREN AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY WERE FACING ALL OF THESE OTHER PROBLEMS THEY WERE OFTEN OSTRACIZED BY FRIENDS WHEN THEY
ALSO TO HELP US FEEL LIKE WE BELONG IN A COMMUNITY AND WE BELONG IN A SOCIETY
HE TALKS HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN HOMELESS SHELTERS AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL IN HOMELESS SHELTERS I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT MUSIC CAN HELP US TO DO
ENJOY THESE LULLABIES
OF ACTIVITY IS TO GROW OUR AUDIENCE AND THAT'S NOT WHY WE DO THIS HUGE HUGE HUGE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY IN THIS SPACE
FOR US
IT'S REALLY ABOUT SERVING PEOPLE THROUGH MUSIC AND AMONG THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK WE ARE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THAT HOW DO WE SERVE PEOPLE THROUGH MUSIC
WE BELIEVE THAT MUSIC IS A BIRTH RIGHT
AND THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO EXTRAORDINARY MUSICAL EXPERIENCES AND MEANINGFUL MUSICAL EXPERIENCES ACROSS ALL MUSIC GENRES SO YES
BUT THERE IS ONE LIMITATION SOMEBODY NEEDS TO HELP ME I WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT
HAPPY ABOUT IT AND LATER I NOTICED THEY WERE NOT THERE WHENEVER I NEEDED
AND INNOVATION I WILL BE ABLE TO WALK UP HERE ALL BY MYSELF
CAN READ TEXTBOOKS BY USING PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES IN BRAILLE OR IN VOICE
THE FRONTIER IS THE REAL WORLD THE BLIND COMMUNITY IS EXPLORING THIS TECHNICAL FRONTIER AND THE PATHFINDER
MY CHALLENGES WAS TEXTBOOKS BACK THEN THERE WERE NO PERSONAL COMPUTERS NO INTERNET NO SMARTPHONES SO I HAD TO ASK ONE OF MY TWO BROTHERS TO READ ME TEXTBOOKS AND I HAD TO CREATE
WAS INVENTED WHILE DEVELOPING A COMMUNICATION TOOL FOR HEARING IMPAIRED PEOPLE SOME KEYBOARDS WERE ALSO
ME TO MOVE AROUND INDOOR AND OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS ALL BY MYSELF
BUT THE COMPUTER VISION PART
THAT SHOWED WHO IS APPROACHING IN WHICH MOOD WE
ARE STILL WORKING ON THAT PART
AND RECOGNIZING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO BE SOCIAL
SO
TODAY I AM MORE INDEPENDENT
BUT IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I APPROACHED THE STAGE JUST NOW
I NEEDED ASSISTANCE
MY GOAL IS TO COME UP HERE INDEPENDENTLY AND NOT JUST HERE
MY GOAL IS TO BE ABLE
I COULD EVEN SEARCH FOR ANY INFORMATION BY MYSELF I DESPERATELY WANTED TO HELP THE BLIND PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND I FOUND WAYS TO RENDER THE WEB INTO SYNTHESIZED
FIND A NICE RESTAURANT WHILE WALKING ALONG A STREET IT WILL BE AMAZING IF
HOW COME THERE IS NO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE BOOKS IN BRAILLE THESE AMAZING TECHNOLOGIES MUST BE ABLE TO ALSO HELP PEOPLE WITH LIMITATIONS LIKE MYSELF
AWAY FROM ME I DON'T BLAME THEM I REALLY WANTED TO BE FREED FROM RELYING ON SOMEONE THAT BECAME MY STRONG DESIRE TO IGNITE INNOVATION
{NS} YOU MIGHT THINK THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT I CAN'T DO BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE THAT'S LARGELY TRUE ACTUALLY I
FOR ME
THE INTERNET IS A SMALL WINDOW TO THE WORLD
IT WAS A REVOLUTIONARY MOMENT FOR THE BLIND
THE CYBER WORLD BECAME ACCESSIBLE AND THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CREATED FOR THE BLIND HAS MANY USES WAY BEYOND WHAT I
BECAME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ALONE FOR EXAMPLE
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE CREATING AN OPEN COMMUNITY TO ACCELERATE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES JUST THIS MORNING WE ANNOUNCED THE OPEN SOURCE FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES YOU JUST SAW IN THE VIDEO
THE REAL WORLD
WE CALL THIS
COGNITIVE ASSISTANCE
IT UNDERSTANDS OUR SURROUNDING WORLD
AND WHISPERS TO ME IN VOICE OR SENDS A VIBRATION TO MY FINGERS
COGNITIVE ASSISTANCE WILL AUGMENT MISSING OR WEAKENED ABILITIES
IN OTHER WORDS OUR FIVE
MY BEST BUDDY AND YOURS
I WAS AN ACTIVE INDEPENDENT TEENAGER AND SUDDENLY I BECAME BLIND THE HARDEST THING FOR ME WAS LOSING
WANT YOU TO STAND UP AND SAY WOOHOO HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM WERE BORN MEN STAND UP AND
IT CAUSES YOU ALL KINDS OF FAILURES IT CAUSES
A LITTLE BIT GOING OUT BUT IT WAS VERY SCARY HALLOWEEN I WOULD GO OUT DRESSED UP IN GIRL'S CLOTHES BUT IT WAS A SCARY PROSPECT HERE I
I SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH BUT IT'S WHAT I BELIEVED I PUSHED IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE FURTHER PUSHED
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE MENTALLY ILL IT'S THAT SOCIETY PRESSURE ON
DRUMMED UP THE COURAGE TO SAY BUT I CAN PRETEND LIKE I'M A GIRL AND THEY SAID NO YOU CAN NOT PLAY WITH US I WALKED AWAY AND SAID I DON'T THINK I SAID DAMN WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD BUT I MIGHT HAVE I
I REALIZED THAT I WASN'T SO I WAS WONDERING WHAT IS THIS WHAT IS THIS INSIDE OF ME WHAT'S
BUT I DIDN'T TRANSITION
THE REASON I DIDN'T TRANSITION
WAS I WAS JUST SCARED
I WAS SCARED TO DEATH I WAS SCARED THAT I WOULD LOSE MY JOB
WHICH I WAS TOLD I WOULD
HAVE
IT'S FUNNY SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY THAT I'M COURAGEOUS BY
BEING MYSELF BUT
I THINK I'M THE BIGGEST CHICKEN THERE EVER WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T
COME OUT I DIDN'T
TRANSITION EARLIER
BECAUSE I WAS JUST FEARFUL I WAS SCARED
THE ONE THAT WAS MURDERED JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THE PERSON THAT MURDERED HER SAID THAT HE MURDERED HER BECAUSE SHE EMBARRASSED HIM
THAT'S EXTREMELY HIGH THE GENERAL POPULATION IS ABOUT 1 5 THE
HE WAS WRONG I AM NOT MALE YOU GO THROUGH THIS WORLD ONCE YOU GET IDENTIFIED WRONG
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAY MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE
VERY SCARED TO SHOW THEM ANY KIND OF FEMININE TRAITS IF YOU DID YOU WOULD CERTAINLY END UP ON THE WRONG
BACK THEN WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF TRANSGENDER YOU HEARD OF A FEW THINGS YOU HEARD OF A FEW PEOPLE ABOUT THIS TIME REN E RICHARDS WAS COMING UP AND A FEW OTHERS BUT IT WAS SO REMOTE THAT IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WOULD FIT YOUR REAL LIFE I
MADE ME HIDE IT EVEN BETTER I GOT BETTER AND BETTER AT HIDING IT MY FRIENDS I WAS
YEARS
OLD
SEEMED LIKE THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF WHEN
MY DAD AND MY BROTHERS WOULD SAY
YOU'RE TOO SENSITIVE YOU CRY TOO MUCH
YOU SHOW YOUR FEELINGS TOO
MUCH IT
IF WE HAD A SOCIETY
THAT WAS OPEN WHERE
YOU COULD CHOOSE YOUR OWN GENDER
I SAID IT CHOOSE I KNOW IT'S A BAD WORD IN OUR COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CHOOSE
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE GAY WE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE TRANSGENDER
BUT I'M SAYING IF YOU COULD CHOOSE
WHAT WOULD IT HURT I'M
GOING TO GO ON AND WE'LL TALK
TIME I WAS FIVE FOR SURE BUT I HAD KNOWN FOR A WHILE AND WHAT THAT SOMETHING WRONG' WAS I KNEW THAT I WAS DIFFERENT ON THE INSIDE THAN I WAS ON THE
AND LIKE I SAID I TRIED TO PUT IT THE BEST I COULD I SAID I LIKE TO EXPRESS MY FEMININE
TOGETHER IF SHE WANTED TO GO SEE A MOVIE WE ALWAYS WENT TOGETHER SHE DIDN'T GO WITH OTHER PEOPLE I DIDN'T GO WITH OTHER PEOPLE SO WE JUST REALLY HUNG AROUND WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS WE
SELF LOATHING THAT DOCTOR THAT LITTLE THING THAT HE DID ASSIGNING ME MALE AT BIRTH SET ME UP FOR THIS WHOLE LIFETIME OF PROBLEMS
EXPRESS OUR GENDER DIFFERENTLY LET'S NOT ASSIGN CHILDREN A GENDER AT BIRTH LET'S LET PEOPLE CHOOSE THEIR OWN MY GENERATION AND YOUR GENERATION ARE SCREWED WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
FELT LIKE I COULDN'T TRANSITION I WENT AHEAD AND I WENT THROUGH THESE NEXT 30 YEARS PRESENTED AS
YOU WORK A LOT OF HOURS AND
SOMETHING INSIDE I LIKE WOMEN'S CLOTHES I LIKE
I GOT UP THE COURAGE TO TELL MY WIFE I SAID I WANT TO BE A WOMAN WE SEPARATED
RIGHT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM AND I WANT YOU
SYSTEM AND MY BEST FRIEND AND NOW I
VERY OPEN MINDED AFTER WE HAVE BEEN DATING FOR A YEAR I TOLD HER THAT I LIKE TO WEAR WOMEN'S CLOTHES AND I TOLD HER THAT INSIDE THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH ME I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT
THIS WAS A DRESS UP DAY AND I WAS DRESSED UP AS COWBOY I WAS NEVER A COWBOY
STILL BEST FRIENDS SAME THING BEST FRIENDS HUNG OUT TOGETHER DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER
OTHER DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER SOON WE HAD A
OF YEARS AFTER IT IT HIT ME I SAID WOW THIS IS REALLY DIFFERENT THIS IS NOT JUST WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHES THIS IS NOT JUST EXPRESSING MY FEMININE SELF THIS IS SOMETHING DEEPER SOMETHING STRONGER SOMETHING REALLY
DOES THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU WHEN I WAS BORN THE DOCTOR LOOKED AT ME HE LOOKED BETWEEN MY LEGS AND HE SAW
HAD GONE THROUGH PUBERTY AND AT THIS TIME YOU'RE SITTING THERE SAYING WOW AM I GAY YOU'RE SITTING THERE THINKING THAT YOU MIGHT BE AND SO I EXPERIMENTED WITH IT AND SOON FOUND OUT I REALLY DIDN'T
SOCIETY THAT PUT PRESSURE ON YOU TO CONFORM TO THE
THOUGH WE WERE BEST
FRIENDS
WE FOUGHT THROUGH
IT SHE CALLED ME UP BOTH TIMES AND SAID I LOVE YOU I WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER
I'M GOING TO DEAL WITH IT SO WE DID GET BACK TOGETHER THE SECOND TIME WE GOT BACK TOGETHER WE STAYED TOGETHER FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS
AND WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER
WE TOOK EVERY VACATION TOGETHER
AND I'M GOING TO LIVE MY LIFE OPENLY LIKE I SAID LET'S THINK ABOUT
AND SHE WAS VERY OPEN MINDED SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH ME AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND
TOGETHER SHE CONTRACTED CANCER AND SHE DIED LAST MONTH AFTER 39 YEARS
I WANTED TO BE A GIRL IT JUST DIDN'T JAB IT DIDN'T
QUITE A BIT I
DOOR AND I WENT OVER TO PLAY WITH THEM AND I SAID CAN I PLAY WITH YOU ALL THEY SAID NO YOU ARE NOT A GIRL
THAT BUT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU MIGHT
THEY SENT ME RICHARD'S BIO I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD NEED TO READ IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANYONE IN THIS ROOM THAT DIDN'T KNOW WHO THIS INCREDIBLE MAN IS
WHY RICHARD BRANSON CARES ABOUT THIS ISSUE
BACK IS FANTASTIC SO I THINK AS MANY COMPANIES AS POSSIBLE NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND TAKE PEOPLE ON AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE
ALSO JUST LEARNED THAT
IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE A SECOND CHANCE IN LIFE AND I HAD A SECOND CHANCE I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN EMPLOYING 60000 PEOPLE I SUSPECT IF I HAD SPENT 2 3 MONTHS IN PRISON
IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE SECOND CHANCE THEY
CAN DO GREAT
HAS A DRINK PROBLEM WE HELP THEM IF SOMEBODY SMOKES TOO MANY CIGARETTES WE DO OUR BEST TO TRY AND HELP THEM STOP SMOKING TOO MANY CIGARETTES
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND OTHER DRUGS THEY
SAID OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOCK ANYBODY UP EVER AGAIN FOR TAKING ANY KIND OF DRUGS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS HELP
THEM
YOU WROTE AND SENT IT OUT WIDE TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU HIRED FORMER OFFENDERS AND WHAT GREAT WORK THEY DID FOR YOUR COMPANY AND HOW HARD THEY WORKED AND YOU ENCOURAGED OTHER CEOS TO
YOUR CORE BUSINESS AND THAT WAS A RISK WE HAVE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED INMATES SITTING IN THE CROWD
A RECIDIVISM RATE OF AROUND 60 74 IF YOU'RE 18 TO 25 IF YOU'RE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND FAILING 7 OUT OF 10 TIMES I'M SURE YOU WOULD SHUT THAT COMPANY DOWN REALLY QUICKLY AS
B HELLO INMATE HELLO MISTER RICHARD THANK YOU FOR COMING MY QUESTION IS WHAT INSPIRED YOU OR GAVE YOU THE HEART TO HIRE AN EX CONVICT
YOU PEOPLE GOT TIME HERE TO THINK ABOUT
WHEN THEY GET
OUT DO THEY HAVE A HOBBY WHAT COULD THEY DO TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER
AND POSSIBLY RATHER THAN WORKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE PEOPLE HERE COULD ACTUALLY START A BUSINESS WHEN THEY LEAVE
AND START IN A SMALL WAY I STARTED
LITERALLY IN A REALLY SMALL WAY HANDING OUR LEAFLETS OUTSIDE
OUTSIDE CONCERT HALLS SELLING MUSIC GETTING THE MONEY IN FROM THE LEAFLETS AND THEN SENDING THE MUSIC OUT
JUST ONE THING LED ON TO ANOTHER
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DREAM BIG STRAIGHT AWAY JUST TRY TO GET THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF YOUR BUSINESS GOING
S
B
I MESSED UP WHEN I WAS 19 YEARS OLD
I THOUGHT
I COULD GET AWAY WITH NOT PAYING SOME TAXES NOT A GOOD IDEA AND ENDED UP A NIGHT IN PRISON
I WAS FORTUNATE MY PARENTS HAD A HOUSE THEY WERE
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM
WHERE THEY LET INMATES TOUCH A COMPUTER ESPECIALLY A COMPUTER THAT'S CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO TAKE COLLEGE CLASSES
I KNOW THERE'S TALKS ABOUT HAVING SKYPE VISITING FOR FAMILIES THAT CAN'T COME HERE
THERE'S ALSO A NEW PROGRAM THAT MILLICENT TIDWELL AND RODGER MEIER STARTED WHERE YOU CAN READ A BOOK TO YOUR CHILD AND SEND IT HOME ON DISK THAT'S BEING ROLLED OUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS SO I THINK THE BALL'S ROLLING SLOWLY BUT ROLLING AS IT RELATES TO TECHNOLOGY
AND I THINK WITH MR BRANSON'S IDEA AND HIS HELP I THINK WE CAN REALLY KIND OF PUSH THE SYSTEM TO MOVE THIS QUICKER
R B THE SKYPE IDEA JUST SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
THE DRACONIAN SENTENCING THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DO YOU THINK OUR BEHAVIOR WHILE INCARCERATED SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN REGARDS TO
WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO YOU GUYS SPECIFICALLY THE INMATES IN THE
IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE MR SCOTT BUDNICK FOUNDER OF THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ALONG WITH SIR RICHARD BRANSON FOUNDER OF THE VIRGIN
TO BE SETTING AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST OF THE PRISON SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR SOCIETY AS WELL AND INSTEAD IN AMERICA WHEN
HERE HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED NOT ONLY THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT LEARNING BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT LIFE I UNDERSTAND NOW THAT WHAT I DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL AFFECTS NOT ONLY ME
SO I THINK THAT IF THOSE BEHAVIORS WERE CONSIDERED YOU KNOW I CAME IN I DIDN'T HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED TYING TOGETHER SOCIAL GOOD WITH AN ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITY TO BRING MODERN DAY COMMUNICATIONS TO PRISONERS TO HELP BETWEEN PRISONERS AND THEIR
HE'S ABOUT TO START COMMERCIAL SPACE TRAVEL THIS YEAR
S B WE'RE GOING UP
HE'S
UNITED KINGDOM'S NUMBER ONE TWITTER USER
AND HE'S
THE WORLD'S MOST FOLLOWED PERSON ON LINKEDIN
BUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS ABSOLUTELY
A BUSINESSMAN WHAT WE DID WAS WE WENT AND LOOKED AT OTHER COUNTRIES WE LOOKED TO SEE WHETHER ANYBODY ELSE
MAKERS ABOUT HOW TO RUN THIS DIFFERENTLY
I'M A PARENT I HAVE 3 CHILDREN I'VE BEEN IN PRISON FOR 19 YEARS NOW AND THE BIGGEST DIFFICULTY THAT WE FACE IS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY
JUNE I'LL BE RECEIVING 4 DEGREES I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD MATTER AND IF I HAVE A PATTERN OF NOT BEING DISCIPLINED NO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
WHILE THEY'RE WAITING ON BAIL WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT GO TO PRISON AND PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD IT NOT GO TO PRISON BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SUBJECT
FIRST THERE'RE NOW MORE THAN 100 VIRGIN COMPANIES WORLDWIDE EMPLOYING APPROXIMATELY 60000 PEOPLE WHICH MEANS HE'S IN CHARGE OF THE LIVELIHOOD OF 60000 FAMILIES AROUND THE
AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN WE'RE ASKED A QUESTION AND WE CAN RESPOND
OUT IN THE PUBLIC ROLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO BECOME AWARE OF FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE AND WE MAKE THAT PRIVATE SELF PUBLIC THROUGH WHAT WE DO
FORMS OF COMMUNITY AND FRIENDSHIP AND ALL OF YOU SHOULD HAVE COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE COMMITMENT TO THE GOOD CAUSES THAT YOU THINK ARE ESSENTIAL TO BRINGING ABOUT A BETTER WORLD BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO LEAVE THIS TALK AND THIS DAY
I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR MIND NOW BECAUSE THEY'VE COMMUNICATED IT TO ME THEY'VE TOLD ME
PUBLIC SELF TO BE IN LINE WITH THE PRIVATE SELF WE WANT THERE TO BE A UNITY BETWEEN WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE
PEOPLE GIVE SOME THOUGHT AND WARNING I AM SURE HERE TO HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DRESS BECAUSE THEY THINK
IT THEN YOU PROBABLY DO OWE THAT PERSON SATISFACTION IF THEY NEED IT IF
AND THAT IS YOUR MIND WE'RE NOT MIND READERS SOMETIMES WE CAN TELL WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT
OR WE CAN RESPOND WITHOUT THE TRUTH WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO JUSTICE AND WE CAN EITHER SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND ACT JUSTLY OR WE CAN FAIL
WANT YOU TO MAKE SOME NOISE AND I WANT YOU TO DO IT IN YOUR OWN WAY
THE GOAL OF PHYSICS IS TO FIND OUT THESE LAWS AND TO USE THEM TO INTERPRET THE PAST LIKE IN A CAR COLLISION OR CONTROL THE PRESENT LIKE IF I THROW SOMETHING TOWARDS YOU OR TO PREDICT THE FUTURE LIKE YOU STICK YOUR HAND UP AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME AND PLACE TO CATCH IT
LASTLY
WE HAVE THE FREEDOM AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFINE MEANING
THE FACTS SHAPE THE CHOICES WE CAN MAKE BUT THEY DON'T DETERMINE THEM
THE RULES GIVE THE UNIVERSE PREDICTABILITY INSTEAD OF CHAOS
AND THE RULES ALSO SHARPEN OUR CREATIVITY JUST LIKE IN A SONNET OR TWEET WHERE THE RULES MAKE YOU DO MORE
HUMAN BEINGS ARE TOTALLY INSIGNIFICANT BUT WE'RE NOT MEANINGLESS
IT'S A BOLD ASSUMPTION THAT THESE LAWS WILL WORK EVERYWHERE ALL TIMES AND ALL PLACES EVEN IF WE'RE NOT THERE
BUT THE CONSISTENCY OF THE ANSWERS THAT WE GET SHOW US THAT THIS ASSUMPTION SEEMS TO BE TRUE
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME NOW YOU SEE ME YES
YOU'RE NOT REALLY SEEING ME NOW YOU THINK YOU ARE BUT YOU ARE REALLY SEEING ME AS I WAS ONE HUNDRED NANOSECONDS AGO OR SO
WHY IS THAT
IT'S BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR LIGHT
TO TRAVEL FROM ME TO YOU
IF THE SUN DISAPPEARED RIGHT NOW
WE WOULDN'T KNOW FOR EIGHT MINUTES
IF THE ALIENS ARE WATCHING US FROM THE NEAREST STARS THEY'RE SEEING US AS WE WERE YEARS AGO
AND THE MOST DISTANT THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE THAT WE SEE WE'RE LOOKING BACK IN TIME AT THEM BY ALMOST TEN BILLION
OF PHYSICS IT WAS DESIGNED USING A DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS WHO HAS A GPS
BETWEEN MANY NATIONS HAVE LED TO THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE TODAY IT IS A GIFT AND A LEGACY TO THE FUTURE THAT WE BUILD ON
AND IF WE DID THAT EXPERIMENT MORE CAREFULLY YOU WOULD SEE THAT IT WAS AN IDENTICAL
COMMON EXPERIENCE
WHY IS THAT
IT'S BECAUSE THE LAW OF GRAVITY DOESN'T CARE WHO'S DOING THE DROPPING
WHEN AND WHERE IT HAPPENS WITH THE MASS AND COMPOSITION OF THE OBJECT
OKAY YES THERE'S AIR RESISTANCE BUT IF WE TOOK ALL THE AIR OUT OF THIS ROOM FEATHERS WOULD FALL
GALAXY WE HAVE ABOUT 10 TO THE 11 STARS THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO COMPREHEND SO I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT BEGINNING WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW YOU SIR I'D LIKE TO
THAT DEPRESSION THIS IS NORMALLY WHAT THEY DO ON COSMOS OR WHATEVER {LG} ONE INTERESTING THING IS UNDERSTANDING THE LARGEST SCALES IN THE UNIVERSE IS CLOSELY COUPLED TO UNDERSTANDING THE SMALLEST SCALES OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLES YOU CAN'T HAVE
OCCASIONALLY WITH GIANT DETECTORS AND WHEN WE DO THEY ENABLE US TO SEE INTO THE DEEPEST DENSEST REGIONS OF THE UNIVERSE LIKE THE FURNACE AT THE CENTER OF THE SUN
A PLACE FROM WHICH PHOTONS CANNOT ESCAPE
WE ALSO NOW KNOW THAT PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS ARE COMMON
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE THAT WASN'T KNOWN AND NOW THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF KNOWN PLANETS
IN FACT REMEMBER I SAID THERE WERE 10 TO THE 11 STARS IN A TYPICAL GALAXY LIKE THIS ONE
10 TO 11 GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE
THAT MEANS THERE ARE 10 TO THE 22 STARS
ABOUT THAT MANY PLANETS
MANY OF THEM SOME OF THEM MAYBE NONE OF THEM HAVE LIFE
WHAT DO YOU FIND MORE DISTURBING
THE IDEA THAT WE ARE TOTALLY ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE OR THAT WE ARE JUST BUT ONE OF MANY MANY KINDS OF
IS MADE OF DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER PLUS PROTONS NEUTRONS ELECTRONS ORDINARY MATTER WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT FIVE PERCENT OF POND SCUM ON THESE OCEANS OF DARKNESS IN THE UNIVERSE
10 TO THE 11 STARTS IN ONE GALAXY 10 TO THE 11 GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE JUST MYSTERY AND IT TURNS OUT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING GALAXIES GROWING FARTHER AND FARTHER APART INCREASING THE DARKNESS AND VOID BETWEEN THEM BECAUSE OF THE BIG
YOU FEEL SLIGHTLY LESS DEPRESSED I'VE JUST TRIED TO DISTRACT YOU I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SOLVED THE PROBLEM
OURS ARE JUST ARRANGED BETTER {LG}
ALL THE HYDROGEN CARBON AND OXYGEN MOLECULES IN MY BRAIN OR YOURS ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER'S OR FROM THOSE THAT WE FIND IN A ROADKILL POSSUM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
COMPONENT OF THE UNIVERSE
DARK ENERGY
WHAT WONDERS AWAIT US IN THE FUTURE
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NATURE OF THIS DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER
WE'RE TRYING TO TRACE DOWN THE ORIGINS OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY PARTICLES
AND WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUPERNOVA EXPLODE
MY OWN SPECIALTY IS NEUTRINOS NEARLY MASSLESS NEARLY INVISIBLE PARTICLES
THAT ARE EVERYWHERE
IN THE TIME IT TOOK ME TO SAY THAT 10 TO THE 12 OF THEM PASSED THROUGH YOUR EYES
DID
WE ARE CONSTRAINED BY THE FACTS LET'S BEGIN WITH A
TO THE 17 IS EVEN BIGGER
THE SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF IS MORE LIKE 10 TO THE 27 METERS WE ARE INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY UNIMAGINABLY SMALL
THE UNIVERSE IS VERY OLD
INCREDIBLY OLD
WE MIGHT LAST A HUNDRED YEARS
HOMO SAPIENS HAS BEEN ON EARTH FOR ABOUT 100000 THE
THE FIRST IS I WANT YOU TO DROP THE THING FROM EXACTLY THE HEIGHT OF THE CHAIR IN FRONT OF YOU THE TOP OF THE BACK
FIRST OF ALL HUMANS HAVE THE POWER THE MENTAL POWER TO REACH OUT WITH OUR MINDS USING
OUR WONDER OUR CURIOSITY OUR TOOLS AND OUR ABSTRACT REASONING TO REACH OUT INTO THE WHOLE UNIVERSE EXPLORE IT AND UNDERSTAND IT AND MAKE SENSE OF IT
ALL OF THE ATOMS IN YOUR BODY WERE MADE SOMEWHERE WHERE ALL THE HYDROGEN WAS MADE IN THE BIG BANG
ALL THE CARBON OXYGEN ALL THAT STUFF WAS MADE IN THE FIERY FURNACES OF STARS THAT SPEWED THEIR GUTS INTO THE GALAXIES SWIRLED AROUND INTO THE GAS AND FORMED NEW STARS LIKE OUR SUN
SO LITERALLY YOU ARE STARDUST
AND WE ARE BATHED IN THE LIGHT FROM THE BIG BANG ITSELF YOU CAN'T SEE IT IT'S MICROWAVES BUT WE CAN EASILY BUILD INSTRUMENTS TO DETECT IT
THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT SKY
HAS DEFINED ART AND MYTHOLOGY AROUND THE WORLD
AND WITH PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY WE SEE MORE DEEPLY WE SEE A RICHER TAPESTRY
WE ALSO SEE THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THAT MAJESTY
AND THOSE MECHANISMS THEMSELVES ARE BEAUTIFUL
BUT IT'S ONLY THROUGH THE COMBINATION
OF SCIENCE AND CULTURE THAT TOGETHER WE FIND UNDERSTANDING
AND THAT WE DEFINE MEANING
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE COMMON EXPERIENCE CONNECTING US TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE UNIVERSE ITSELF
AND EVEN MORE SO IF WE EARTHLINGS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES LOOKING AT THOSE STARS THANK YOU
YOU FEELING DEPRESSED AGAIN GOOD HOW DO WE COPE WITH THIS TERRIFYING KNOWLEDGE I THINK THERE THREE AMAZING THOUGHTS THAT I LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND
MAYBE THE WINDMILLING SNOWBALL ARM IN ELF AND I RUN TOWARDS YOU THEN THE THINGS ARE GOING TO GO FASTER IF I THROW THEM WHILE I'M RUNNING AWAY THEY'LL GO SLOWER
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I DROPPED THAT THING AND HOW I FELT ABOUT IT MAYBE IT'S NOT WORTH A BOOK BUT MAYBE IT'S WORTH A TWEET
TOO MANY PATIENTS AND BY MY 30TH BIRTHDAY IN JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS' TIME THIS DISEASE WILL BE
ONLY SLOW THE PROGRESSION AND THEY'RE NOT FUN AND
CAN DEFEND REGARDLESS OF THAT OUTCOME
TO BOOST HOW MANY ARE SAVED THE OVERALL PLAN IS TO
THE VISUAL FIELD BACK TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE
IS WORTH ITS OWN HYPE
AND
IF MY ANTIOXIDANT HYPOTHESIS IS TRUE
THE FILM WILL FIGHT THE OXIDATIVE STRESS SO THE TRANSPLANTED CELLS CAN LIVE THROUGH
TO START THAT CLEAN UP MISSION
AND WIN THAT TOXIC
TRIGGERING OXIDATIVE STRESS
WHICH CAUSES CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND EVENTUALLY
CELL DEATH
SO BY THE TIME IT'S DIAGNOSED CELLS ARE ALREADY DYING AND DEAD
SO HOW ON EARTH CAN WE FIX THIS
WELL
WE HAVE AN
TO UV LIGHT DAMAGE IS ONE THING TO BLAME THE OTHERS ARE SMOKING GENETICS IMMUNE SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS ALL THESE THINGS
A PHD STUDENT RUNNING EXPERIMENTS IN A LAB TRYING TO BETTER TREAT A TYPE OF BLINDNESS IT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I'VE EVER HAD
OF BLINDNESS WHERE YOU'RE BORN WITHOUT SIGHT
AND I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF PROCLAIMING THAT THOSE PEOPLE DON'T LOVE THEIR LIFE
BUT THE DISEASE THAT I WORK ON STRIKES AT AROUND RETIREMENT AGE
STEALING FACIAL RECOGNITION DRIVER'S LICENSE INDEPENDENCE HOBBIES
AND DEPRESSION IS RIFE
THESE INNER FIBERS INTO FABRIC I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT WE'VE BEEN LETTING THE BEST PART JUST WASH OUT TO SEA MILLIONS OF TONS OF THIS STUFF
MILLION BY THE TIME I'M 50 YEARS OLD NOW I DON'T WANT THAT IN MY FUTURE
THAT THE SCULPTURE IS MADE OF
AND I
HAD A LOT
OF ALWAYS INTERESTED IN THE CONCEPT OF A CRYSTAL BALL AND THE IDEA INSIDE OF A CRYSTAL BALL AND PREDICT THE FUTURE
OR A TELEVISION SET WHERE IT'S SORT OF LIKE A MAGIC BOX WHERE ANYTHING
CAN APPEAR
I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT A LONG TIME AGO IN THE
LATE 60S WHEN WAS JUST STARTING OUT I WAS
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THINKING ABOUT BUCKMINSTER FULLER'S
GRAND PROJECT FOR AN ELECTRIC GLOBE ACROSS FROM THE UNITED NATIONS AND
OTHER THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING THE SPACE PROGRAM AT THAT TIME AND
WHOLE EARTH CATALOG THINGS LIKE THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT MASS PRODUCED SPHERICAL TELEVISION SETS THAT COULD BE LINKED TO ORBITING CAMERA SATELLITES
SO
IF WE COULD ROLL THE
MY WORK
I SORT OF HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF INTERESTS AND SOME OF IT IS JUST THE IDEA OF CREATING MEDIA
MEDIA AS A SCULPTURE SOMETHING THAT WOULD KEEP THE SCULPTURE FRESH AND EVER CHANGING BY JUST CREATING THE
WILL ENABLE MACHINES ALONG WITH THE ABILITY TO LOOK FURTHER AHEAD THAN HUMANS CAN AS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN GO
EXCEPT STOP DOING AI
AND BECAUSE OF ALL THE BENEFITS THAT I MENTIONED AND BECAUSE I'M AN AI RESEARCHER I'M NOT HAVING THAT
I
ACTUALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP DOING AI
SO WE ACTUALLY NEED TO NAIL DOWN THE PROBLEM A BIT MORE WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM WHY IS BETTER AI POSSIBLY A CATASTROPHE
IN FACT IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK THAT WAY JUST BECAUSE YOU BEHAVE BADLY DOESN'T MEAN THE ROBOT IS GOING TO COPY YOUR BEHAVIOR IT'S GOING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTIVATIONS AND MAYBE HELP YOU RESIST THEM IF APPROPRIATE
DAVE OUTWITS HIM AND MANAGES TO SWITCH HIM OFF BUT WE MIGHT NOT BE SO LUCKY
THE PROBLEM THAT WE FACE AND IN FACT THAT'S THE HIGH VALUE TAKEAWAY FROM THIS TALK IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER ONE THING
I BEHAVE BADLY I DON'T WANT MY ROBOT TO BEHAVE LIKE ME I SNEAK DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND TAKE STUFF FROM THE FRIDGE I DO THIS AND THAT THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS YOU DON'T WANT THE ROBOT DOING
IF ANY HUMAN EVER TRIES TO SWITCH ME OFF I COMPLY I COMPLY SR ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA SO IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE A SELF DRIVING CAR AND YOU WANT TO SEND YOUR FIVE YEAR OLD OFF TO PRESCHOOL
SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THE PROBLEM OF CREATING SOMETHING MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOUR OWN SPECIES WE MIGHT CALL THIS THE GORILLA PROBLEM BECAUSE GORILLAS' ANCESTORS DID THIS FEW MILLION YEARS AGO
AWAY FROM THIS CLASSICAL NOTION OF MACHINES THAT INTELLIGENTLY PURSUE OBJECTIVES
AND PROBABLY TASER ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN STARBUCKS WHO MIGHT INTERFERE WITH ME
AND IT'S NOT DESIGNED JUST
TO SATISFY THE DESIRES OF ONE PERSON THE USER BUT IN FACT IT HAS TO RESPECT THE PREFERENCES OF EVERYBODY
SO IT CAN DEAL WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NASTINESS AND IT CAN EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR NASTINESS FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY TAKE BRIBES AS PASSPORT OFFICIAL
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO FEED YOUR FAMILY AND SEND YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL
IT CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO STEAL IN FACT IT'LL JUST HELP YOU SEND YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE PRINCIPLES LET'S SEE HOW THAT APPLIES TO THIS QUESTION OF CAN YOU SWITCH THE MACHINE OFF AS TURING SUGGESTED
MAXIMIZE THE REALIZATION OF HUMAN OBJECTIVES OF HUMAN VALUES AND BY VALUES HERE I DON'T MEAN TOUCHY FEELY GOODY GOODY VALUES I JUST MEAN WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE HUMAN WOULD PREFER THEIR LIFE TO BE LIKE
AND IN FACT YOU CAN CALCULATE THE INCENTIVE THAT THE ROBOT HAS TO ALLOW THE HUMAN TO SWITCH IT OFF AND IT'S DIRECTLY TIED TO THE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE UNDERLYING OBJECTIVE
STATING AN OBJECTIVE WHICH IS NOT IN FACT TRULY ALIGNED WITH WHAT WE WANT IN MODERN TERMS WE CALL THIS THE VALUE ALIGNMENT PROBLEM
SO YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION FOR EXAMPLE WITH YOUR INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE IN A FEW YEARS' TIME THINK OF A SIRI ON STEROIDS
CA AND YOU COULDN'T JUST BOIL IT DOWN TO ONE LAW YOU KNOW HARDWIRED
ASKED FOR THAT WAS THE PURPOSE THAT HE PUT INTO THE MACHINE SO TO SPEAK AND THEN HIS FOOD AND HIS DRINK AND HIS RELATIVES TURNED TO GOLD AND HE DIED IN MISERY AND STARVATION SO WE'LL CALL THIS THE KING MIDAS PROBLEM
STUART CAN I JUST SAY I REALLY REALLY HOPE YOU FIGURE THIS OUT FOR US THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT TALK THAT WAS
DO YOU WANT YOUR FIVE YEAR OLD TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH OFF THE CAR WHILE IT'S DRIVING ALONG PROBABLY NOT SO IT NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
HOW RATIONAL AND SENSIBLE THE PERSON IS THE MORE RATIONAL THE PERSON THE MORE WILLING YOU ARE TO BE SWITCHED OFF IF THE PERSON IS COMPLETELY RANDOM OR EVEN MALICIOUS THEN YOU'RE LESS WILLING TO BE SWITCHED
AND THERE ARE MANY MANY DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN DOING THIS I DON'T EXPECT THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET SOLVED VERY QUICKLY THE REAL DIFFICULTIES IN FACT ARE US
STILL A DECISION PROBLEM
AND IF WE THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE
PIKE NORIKO ARAI MENTIONED THAT READING IS NOT YET HAPPENING IN MACHINES AT LEAST WITH UNDERSTANDING BUT THAT WILL HAPPEN
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS
ARE LOTS OF US AND SO THE MACHINE HAS TO SOMEHOW TRADE OFF WEIGH UP THE PREFERENCES OF MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
THE SECOND LAW IS A LAW OF HUMILITY IF YOU LIKE AND THIS TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE ROBOTS
REASON IS THERE IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA BECAUSE REMEMBER I SAID THEY'RE GOING TO READ EVERYTHING THE HUMAN RACE HAS EVER WRITTEN MOST OF WHAT WE WRITE ABOUT IS HUMAN BEINGS DOING THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE GETTING UPSET ABOUT IT SO THERE'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA TO LEARN
HAS TO FEED THE KIDS AND THE KIDS HUNGRY AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE FRIDGE AND THE ROBOT SEES THE CAT
ACTUALLY NO THIS IDEA HAS BEEN AROUND FOR WHILE HERE'S A QUOTATION
IS A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH HUMAN COMPATIBLE AI
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MACHINE IS UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE WELL IT REASONS IN A DIFFERENT WAY IT
CORRECT
SO THE EVIDENCE IS THERE AND IT'S GOING TO BE DESIGNED TO INTERPRET IT CORRECTLY IT WILL UNDERSTAND FOR EXAMPLE THAT BOOKS ARE VERY BIASED IN THE EVIDENCE THEY CONTAIN THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT KINGS AND PRINCES AND ELITE WHITE MALE PEOPLE DOING
STUFF SO IT'S A COMPLICATED PROBLEM
BUT
AS IT LEARNS MORE ABOUT OUR OBJECTIVES IT WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE
WHICH IS HAPPY WIFE HAPPY LIFE {LG} IT COULD GO THE OTHER WAY YOU COULD COME HOME AFTER HARD DAY'S WORK AND THE
SO TO UNDERSTAND HIS BEHAVIOR WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO INVERT THROUGH A MODEL OF HUMAN COGNITION THAT INCLUDES OUR COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS A VERY COMPLICATED MODEL
BUT IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK ON UNDERSTANDING
PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT PART FROM MY POINT OF VIEW AS AN AI RESEARCHER
IS THE FACT THAT
RIGHT IN FACT WE CAN WITH SUITABLE USE OF GREEK SYMBOLS AS MATHEMATICIANS USUALLY DO WE CAN ACTUALLY PROVE A THEOREM
THE MACHINE SAYS TO ITSELF WELL HOW MIGHT I FAIL TO FETCH THE COFFEE SOMEONE MIGHT SWITCH ME OFF OK I HAVE TO TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT THAT I WILL DISABLE MY OFF' SWITCH
SO IS THAT A GOOD THING WELL I HOPE SO
ACTUALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF AI SO THAT WE HAVE PROVABLY BENEFICIAL MACHINES
TO TALK TO EVERYONE PEOPLE FROM HIS PHARMACY CUSTOMERS FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE OR NEW PEOPLE HE MET ON THE BOARDWALK WHERE HE WAS THE
BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO ASK FROM THERE I WAS ON A QUEST TO
AS TEACHING TOOL THE FIRST TIME I WAS EVER INVITED TO SPEAK ANYWHERE WAS AT MY NEPHEW'S THIRD GRADE CLASSROOM
THAT TOPIC WAS INSPIRED BY ANOTHER MAN ERNEST HEMINGWAY AS THE STORY GOES HEMINGWAY WAS ONCE CHALLENGED
TOPICS LIFE CHANGING MOMENTS PUT THEM HERE DID YOU HAVE A BREAK UP OVER HERE DIFFERENT TOPICS AND PEOPLE LIKED IT BUT THEN ONE TOPIC RESONATED LIKE NONE
AWESOME THEY TOLD ME WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUT IN THE WORLD WITH SIX WORDS IDEAS I'D NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT AND THE MOST AMAZING THING FOR ME WAS THAT TEACHERS WERE USING
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER MY GRANDFATHER STOPPED TALKING WHAT I LEARNED THAT DAY WAS THAT EVERYONE HAS A STORY WE
COMMUNITY HEY LET'S GIVE THIS SIX WORD NOVEL A PERSONAL TWIST THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AT SMITH MAG WRITE THE SIX WORD STORY OF YOUR LIFE CALL IT THE SIX WORD
THE STORIES OF THEIR TIME IN A PERSONAL WAY
WENT AROUND WE SHARED THEIR SIX WORD MEMOIRS OUR FIRST BOOK OF SIX WORD MEMOIRS CALLED NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS PLANNING SIX WORD MEMOIRS BY WRITERS FAMOUS AND
OWN SITE AND I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED THE NIGHT BEFORE THE THING IS IT WAS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN
I FIGURED WE'D GET A FEW IN AND IT WOULD BE FUN ANOTHER PART OF SMITH WENT HOME FOR THANKSGIVING THE NEXT D Y WHEN I CHECKED MY
OTHERS
WERE USING IT IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT MADE SENSE TO THEM
SO PRIESTS AND RABBIS SAW THE SIX WORD FORM AS A WAY TO GET TO THE ESSENCE OF COMPLEX QUESTIONS OF FAITH
SUICIDE PREVENTION CENTERS AND SPEED DATING SESSIONS
USED THE SIX WORD TOOL
GRANDFATHER SMITTY THIS GREAT STORYTELLER MASCOT CHICKEN WHY WELL SMITH MAGAZINE WAS GOING TO BE A PLACE WHERE
WHEN YOU KNOW THE BEAR AND YOU KNOW THE BEAR'S STORY MAYBE THE BEAR ISN'T
SHIRT HAS SIX WORDS I WROTE WHICH ARE PARENTING IDIOT EXPERT IDIOT EXPERT IDIOT
WAS JUST KICKING IN AND HOW COULD I DO THAT I LEFT WHAT I LIKE TO CALL MY FANCY MAGAZINE CAREER WHICH WAS GREAT I WORKED AT PLACES YOU'VE HEARD OF PLACES NOW OUT OF BUSINESS START MY OWN
I WAS SAYING HE'S 10 MY KID'S 11 MONTHS OLD WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING A DAD HE SAID MAN 10
WORDS SOMEONE ELSE TOLD TO ME BUDDY OF MINE NAMED MICHAEL ONE OF THE FIRST GUYS IN MY KIND OF CLOSE FRIENDED GROUP TO HAVE KID THIS KID WAS NINE BY THE TIME MY KID WAS 10 OR 11
I WAS NERVOUS YOU THINK YOU GUYS SCARY 40 BEADY LITTLE EYES STARING AT ME HANGING ON MY EVERY WORD I
BEING A FATHER WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A SON AND THEY'RE GOING TO TELL YOU LITTLE
HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD HE WAS A SMALL TOWN PHARMACIST AND AS WE WALKED DOWN THE ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK THE PROBLEM WAS WE NEVER GOT VERY FAR BECAUSE MY
WE MAY NOT FIGURE THAT OUT OUR WHOLE LIVES AND SHE'S GOT IT DOWN ALREADY THERE'S BEEN SO
THAT UP COMMUNITY BRING THIS SIX WORD TOOL INTO THE COMMUNITY TO TALK AMONG YOURSELVES CONVEY YOUR MESSAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND GOOD SIX WORD MEMOIR SHOULD WORK IN AND OF ITSELF
STOP CREATIVITY IT FUELED CREATIVITY PEOPLE LOVED
AND THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN THINK ABOUT THE STORIES THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM THESE GUYS TODAY ABOUT HOW THEY MAKE
WORK WITH THEIR FATHERS AND THEIR SONS AND THAT MAKING THAT TIME WORK ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT BEING IN THE SAME ROOM IT'S ABOUT MAKING IT WORK THE WAY YOU CAN
THEY START WITH THE SIX WORDS THEN THEY TELL THE BACK STORY AND CONVERSATIONS BEGIN
THE MILITARY AND PRISON ARE TWO THINGS THAT EVERYONE HAS AN OPINION ABOUT BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP
I SAID LOOK I HAVE A NEW VIDEO CAMERA LET ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THIS THING JUST
I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO A COUPLE OF THESE PLACES WHERE SIX WORDS HAS BECOME A TOOL BEFORE WE BRING IT RIGHT HERE TODAY AT
AND THAT'S THE LEAST INTERESTING PART OF THE PROJECT
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE STORY OF MY OWN THE T SHIRT I WEAR TODAY
VETERAN WHAT HAPPENED AT WAR YOU MAY VERY WELL GET ONE OF TWO ANSWERS I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO END
BEFORE WE HEAR FROM THEM I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR
SIX WORD MEMOIRS BY MRS NIXON'S THIRD GRADE CLASS {LG} I WANT TO SHARE A FEW TODAY
COMMUNICATIONS SPUR SELF EXPRESSION OR SIMPLY BREAK THE ICE
PERSPECTIVE BUT NOT THE PERSPECTIVE THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN WE HAD STORY
HIS SECTION ONE DAY AS WE WALKED DOWN THE BOARDWALK I REALIZED WHAT KIDS
OF PEOPLE DO BUT THOSE WITH THE OPINIONS OFTEN DON'T BUT WHEN YOU
THE METHODS OF ANTHROPOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTIONS IN WHICH I'M INTERESTED
SO ALONG WITH THREE CO CONSPIRATORS I SPENT NEARLY A DECADE OBSERVING UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL EXCEPTIONAL LEADERS OF INNOVATION
WE STUDIED 16 MEN AND WOMEN LOCATED IN SEVEN COUNTRIES ACROSS THE GLOBE WORKING IN 12 DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES
IN TOTAL WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS ON THE GROUND ON SITE WATCHING THESE LEADERS IN ACTION
THAT PROVOCATIVE MOVIE ABOUT A RAT BECOMING MASTER CHEF
COMPUTER GENERATED MOVIES ARE REALLY MAINSTREAM TODAY BUT IT TOOK ED AND HIS COLLEAGUES NEARLY 20 YEARS TO CREATE THE FIRST FULL LENGTH C G MOVIE
IN THE 20 YEARS HENCE THEY'VE PRODUCED 14 MOVIES
I WAS
ABOUT HOW DO WE DESIGN A STUDIO THAT HAS THE SENSIBILITY
OF A PUBLIC SQUARE SO THAT PEOPLE WILL INTERACT
LET'S PUT IN A POLICY THAT ANYONE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR LEVEL OR ROLE IS ALLOWED TO GIVE NOTES TO THE DIRECTOR ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT A PARTICULAR
FILM WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE DISRUPTORS ALL THE MINORITY VOICES IN THIS ORGANIZATION SPEAK UP AND ARE HEARD
AND FINALLY LET'S BESTOW CREDIT IN A VERY GENEROUS WAY
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER LOOKED AT THE CREDITS OF PIXAR MOVIE BUT THE BABIES BORN DURING A PRODUCTION ARE LISTED THERE
OF A MOVIE AT PIXAR THE STORY EVOLVES SO THINK ABOUT IT SOME SHOTS GO THROUGH QUICKLY THEY DON'T ALL GO THROUGH IN ORDER IT DEPENDS ON HOW VEXING THE CHALLENGES ARE THAT THEY COME UP WITH WHEN THEY ARE WORKING
FAILED TO REALLY TELL YOU JUST HOW ITERATIVE INTERRELATED AND FRANKLY MESSY THEIR PROCESS WAS
TO CREATE A VISION
BUT IF I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TRULY NEW I HAVE NO ANSWERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION WE'RE GOING IN AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE I KNOW HOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE
FOR SURE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN VISIONARY LEADERSHIP IS EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED
BUT IF WE WANT TO BUILD ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN INNOVATE TIME AND AGAIN WE MUST RECAST OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT
LEADING INNOVATION
IS ABOUT CREATING THE SPACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO DO THE HARD WORK OF INNOVATIVE PROBLEM
SOLVING AT THIS POINT SOME OF YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHAT DOES THAT LEADERSHIP REALLY LOOK LIKE
AT PIXAR THEY UNDERSTAND THAT INNOVATION TAKES VILLAGE
THE LEADERS FOCUS ON BUILDING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND BUILDING THOSE THREE CAPABILITIES
HOW DO THEY DEFINE LEADERSHIP THEY SAY LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT CREATING A WORLD TO WHICH PEOPLE WANT TO BELONG
WHAT KIND OF WORLD DO PEOPLE WANT TO BELONG IN AT PIXAR A WORLD WHERE YOU'RE LIVING AT THE FRONTIER
WHAT DO THEY FOCUS THEIR TIME ON NOT ON CREATING A VISION INSTEAD THEY SPEND THEIR
HAVE SEEN A PIXAR MOVIE BUT VERY FEW OF YOU RECOGNIZED ED CATMULL THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF PIXAR ONE OF THE COMPANIES I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF STUDYING MY FIRST VISIT TO PIXAR WAS IN 2005 WHEN THEY WERE WORKING
IS THAT NO PART OF THE MOVIE IS CONSIDERED FINISHED UNTIL THE ENTIRE MOVIE WRAPS
PARTWAY THROUGH ONE PRODUCTION AN ANIMATOR DREW A CHARACTER WITH AN ARCHED EYEBROW THAT SUGGESTED A MISCHIEVOUS SIDE
WHEN THE DIRECTOR SAW THAT DRAWING HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO LOSE IT IT DOESN'T FIT THE CHARACTER
TWO WEEKS LATER THE DIRECTOR CAME BACK AND SAID LET'S PUT IN THOSE FEW SECONDS OF FILM
BECAUSE THAT ANIMATOR WAS ALLOWED TO SHARE WHAT WE REFERRED TO AS HIS SLICE OF GENIUS
HE WAS ABLE TO HELP THAT DIRECTOR RECONCEIVE THE CHARACTER IN A SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT WAY THAT REALLY IMPROVED THE STORY
WHAT WE KNOW IS AT THE HEART OF
GROUP OF GOOGLE IS THE GROUP THAT HAS TO KEEP THE WEBSITE UP AND RUNNING 24 7
SO WHEN GOOGLE WAS ABOUT TO INTRODUCE GMAIL AND YOUTUBE THEY KNEW THAT THEIR DATA STORAGE SYSTEM WASN'T ADEQUATE
THE HEAD OF THE ENGINEERING GROUP AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP AT THAT TIME WAS A MAN NAMED BILL COUGHRAN
BILL AND HIS LEADERSHIP TEAM WHO HE REFERRED TO AS HIS BRAIN TRUST HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS SITUATION
THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE
INSTEAD OF CREATING A GROUP TO TACKLE THIS TASK THEY DECIDED TO ALLOW GROUPS TO EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY
AROUND DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES
TWO GROUPS COALESCED ONE BECAME KNOWN AS BIG TABLE
THE OTHER BECAME KNOWN AS BUILD IT FROM SCRATCH
OF MARKETING AT A GERMAN AUTOMAKER WHERE FUNDAMENTALLY THEY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS THE DESIGN ENGINEERS NOT THE MARKETEERS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO BE INNOVATIVE
WE ALSO STUDIED VINEET NAYAR AT HCL TECHNOLOGIES AN INDIAN OUTSOURCING COMPANY
WHEN WE MET VINEET HIS COMPANY WAS ABOUT IN HIS WORDS TO BECOME IRRELEVANT WE WATCHED AS HE TURNED THAT COMPANY INTO A GLOBAL DYNAMO OF I T INNOVATION
AT HCL TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AT MANY COMPANIES THE LEADERS HAD LEARNED TO SEE THEIR ROLE AS SETTING DIRECTION AND MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE DEVIATED FROM IT
WHAT HE DID
IS TELL THEM IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO THINK ABOUT RETHINKING WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING UP AND YOU WEREN'T SEEING THE KIND OF BOTTOM UP INNOVATION WE SAW AT PIXAR GOOGLE
SO THEY BEGAN TO WORK ON THAT THEY STOPPED GIVING ANSWERS THEY STOPPED TRYING TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS
IS A JOURNEY
IT'S A TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING USUALLY AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERTISE AND DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW
INNOVATIONS RARELY GET CREATED FULL BLOWN
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE RESULT USUALLY OF TRIAL AND ERROR
LOTS OF FALSE STARTS MISSTEPS AND MISTAKES
INNOVATIVE WORK CAN BE VERY EXHILARATING
BUT IT ALSO CAN BE REALLY DOWNRIGHT SCARY
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHY IT IS THAT PIXAR IS ABLE TO DO WHAT IT DOES WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
FOR SURE HISTORY AND CERTAINLY HOLLYWOOD IS FULL OF STAR STUDDED TEAMS THAT HAVE FAILED
MOST OF THOSE FAILURES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO TOO MANY STARS OR TOO MANY COOKS IF YOU WILL IN THE KITCHEN
SO WHY IS IT THAT PIXAR WITH ALL OF ITS COOKS
IS ABLE TO BE SO SUCCESSFUL TIME AND TIME AGAIN
WHEN WE STUDIED AN ISLAMIC BANK IN DUBAI
OR A LUXURY BRAND IN KOREA
OR A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE IN AFRICA
WE FOUND THAT INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THREE CAPABILITIES
WERE ENCOURAGED TO BUILD PROTOTYPES SO THAT THEY COULD BUMP THEM UP AGAINST REALITY AND DISCOVER FOR THEMSELVES THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THEIR PARTICULAR APPROACH
WHEN BUILD IT FROM SCRATCH SHARED THEIR PROTOTYPE WITH THE GROUP WHOSE BEEPERS WOULD HAVE TO GO OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH THE WEBSITE THEY HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF THEIR PARTICULAR DESIGN
AS THE NEED FOR A SOLUTION BECAME MORE URGENT AND AS THE DATA OR THE EVIDENCE BEGAN TO COME IN IT BECAME PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE BIG TABLE SOLUTION WAS THE RIGHT ONE FOR THE MOMENT
SO THEY SELECTED THAT ONE
BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DID NOT LOSE THE LEARNING OF THE BUILD IT FROM SCRATCH TEAM BILL ASKED TWO MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM TO JOIN A NEW TEAM THAT WAS EMERGING TO WORK ON THE NEXT GENERATION SYSTEM
THIS WHOLE PROCESS TOOK NEARLY TWO YEARS BUT I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE ALL WORKING AT BREAKNECK SPEED
EARLY IN THAT PROCESS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS HAD GONE TO BILL AND SAID WE'RE ALL TOO BUSY FOR THIS INEFFICIENT SYSTEM OF RUNNING PARALLEL EXPERIMENTS
BUT AS THE PROCESS UNFOLDED HE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING TALENTED PEOPLE TO PLAY OUT THEIR PASSIONS HE ADMITTED IF YOU HAD FORCED US TO ALL BE ON ONE TEAM WE MIGHT HAVE FOCUSED ON PROVING WHO WAS RIGHT AND WINNING AND NOT ON LEARNING AND DISCOVERING WHAT WAS THE BEST ANSWER FOR GOOGLE
WHY IS IT THAT PIXAR
WHEN MANY OF US THINK ABOUT INNOVATION THOUGH WE THINK ABOUT AN EINSTEIN HAVING AN AHA MOMENT
BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT'S A MYTH
INNOVATION IS NOT ABOUT SOLO GENIUS
IT'S ABOUT COLLECTIVE GENIUS
LET'S THINK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A PIXAR MOVIE
NO SOLO GENIUS NO FLASH OF INSPIRATION PRODUCES ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
ON THE CONTRARY IT TAKES ABOUT 250 PEOPLE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS TO MAKE ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
OF THE MANY BY LOOSENING THE STRANGLEHOLD OF THE FEW AND INCREASE THE QUALITY AND THE SPEED OF INNOVATION THAT WAS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
PIXAR AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT NUMBER 15 IS SURE TO BE A WINNER
ABOUT WHAT HIS ROLE WAS BILL SAID I LEAD A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION TALENTED PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW ME ANYWHERE
THEY WANT TO COCREATE WITH ME THE FUTURE
MY JOB IS TO NURTURE THE BOTTOM UP AND NOT LET IT DEGENERATE INTO CHAOS
HOW DID HE SEE HIS ROLE I'M ROLE MODEL I'M A HUMAN GLUE I'M A CONNECTOR I'M AN AGGREGATOR OF VIEWPOINTS I'M NEVER A DICTATOR OF VIEWPOINTS ADVICE ABOUT HOW YOU EXERCISE THE ROLE HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARGUE WITH YOU
AND GUESS WHAT SOMETIMES IT'S BEST TO BE DELIBERATELY FUZZY AND VAGUE
SOME OF YOU MAY BE WONDERING NOW WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE THINKING THEY'RE THINKING I'M NOT THE VISIONARY I'M THE SOCIAL ARCHITECT I'M CREATING THE SPACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO SHARE AND COMBINE THEIR TALENTS AND PASSIONS
IF SOME OF YOU ARE WORRYING NOW THAT YOU DON'T WORK AT A PIXAR OR YOU DON'T WORK AT A GOOGLE I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S STILL HOPE
WE'VE STUDIED MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE REALLY NOT ORGANIZATIONS YOU'D THINK OF AS ONES WHERE A LOT OF INNOVATION HAPPENS
WE STUDIED GENERAL COUNSEL IN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY WHO HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE OUTSIDE LAWYERS 19 COMPETITORS TO COLLABORATE AND INNOVATE
WE
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT WHAT MANY OF US THINK OF AS GREAT LEADERSHIP DOES NOT WORK WHEN IT COMES TO LEADING INNOVATION I'M AN ETHNOGRAPHER
IN VINEET'S LANGUAGE THIS WAS ABOUT INVERTING THE PYRAMID SO THAT YOU COULD
ORGANIZATIONS THEY AMPLIFY DIFFERENCES THEY DON'T MINIMIZE THEM
CREATIVE ABRASION IS NOT ABOUT BRAINSTORMING WHERE PEOPLE SUSPEND THEIR JUDGMENT NO THEY KNOW HOW TO HAVE VERY HEATED BUT CONSTRUCTIVE ARGUMENTS TO CREATE A PORTFOLIO OF ALTERNATIVES
INDIVIDUALS IN INNOVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS LEARN HOW TO INQUIRE THEY LEARN HOW TO ACTIVELY LISTEN BUT GUESS WHAT THEY ALSO LEARN HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR POINT OF VIEW
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT INNOVATION RARELY HAPPENS UNLESS YOU HAVE BOTH DIVERSITY AND CONFLICT
CREATIVE AGILITY IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO
UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR ROLE AS LEADERS IS TO SET THE STAGE NOT PERFORM ON
IT IF WE WANT TO INVENT A BETTER FUTURE AND I SUSPECT THAT'S WHY MANY OF US ARE HERE
THEN WE NEED TO REIMAGINE OUR TASK
OUR TASK IS TO CREATE THE SPACE WHERE EVERYBODY'S SLICES OF
OF COLLECTIVE GENIUS THANK YOU
IT CAN BE A PROCESS OR A WAY OF ORGANIZING IT CAN BE INCREMENTAL OR IT CAN BE BREAKTHROUGH WE HAVE A PRETTY INCLUSIVE DEFINITION
OPINION
THAT BILL WAS ONE OF THE FINEST LEADERS IN SILICON VALLEY
WE COMPLETELY AGREED THE MAN IS A GENIUS
LEADERSHIP IS THE SECRET SAUCE
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF LEADERSHIP NOT THE KIND MANY OF US THINK ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GREAT LEADERSHIP
ONE OF THE LEADERS I MET WITH EARLY ON SAID TO ME LINDA
I DON'T READ BOOKS ON LEADERSHIP
IN THE
PROPOSED THAT THEY BUILD ON THE CURRENT SYSTEM BUILD IT FROM SCRATCH PROPOSED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM
SEPARATELY THESE TWO TEAMS WERE ALLOWED TO WORK FULL TIME ON THEIR PARTICULAR APPROACH
IN ENGINEERING REVIEWS BILL DESCRIBED HIS ROLE AS INJECTING HONESTY INTO THE PROCESS
BY DRIVING DEBATE
EARLY
VINEET AND ALL THE OTHER LEADERS THAT WE STUDIED WERE IN FACT VISIONARIES FOR SURE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS NOT THEIR ROLE SO I DON'T THINK IT IS ACCIDENTAL THAT MANY OF YOU DID
{NS} THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSEST TO THE CUSTOMERS AS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
ARE ABLE TO INNOVATE TIME AND AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE MASTERED THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO DO COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING THEY KNOW HOW TO DO DISCOVERY DRIVEN LEARNING AND THEY KNOW HOW TO DO INTEGRATED DECISION MAKING
SOME OF YOU MAY BE SITTING THERE AND SAYING TO YOURSELVES RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS IN MY ORGANIZATION SO WHY DO THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS AT PIXAR AND WHY DO THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS AT
HE DID SO RELUCTANTLY BECAUSE IT SUGGESTED THAT THE PROCESS WAS A NEAT SERIES OF
WE ENDED UP WITH PAGES AND PAGES AND PAGES OF FIELD NOTES THAT WE ANALYZED AND LOOKED FOR PATTERNS IN WHAT OUR LEADERS DID
THE BOTTOM LINE IF WE WANT TO BUILD ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN INNOVATE TIME AND AGAIN WE MUST UNLEARN OUR CONVENTIONAL NOTIONS OF LEADERSHIP
LEADING INNOVATION IS NOT ABOUT CREATING A VISION AND INSPIRING OTHERS TO EXECUTE IT
COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS HERE AND THERE ONE EXCEPTION IS IN MASSACHUSETTS THAT WAS JOHN KERRY'S HOME STATE NO BIG SURPRISE OBAMA COULDN'T DO BETTER THAN KERRY THERE OR IN
THAT RACE WAS A FACTOR AND THE REASON WHY WE KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE WE ASKED THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T ASK THEM BUT WHEN THEY CONDUCTED EXIT POLLS IN
DESIGN WHICH BECAME MORE PREVALENT IN THE 1970S AND 1980S I THINK THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT AND THE COUNTRY BECOMING MORE CONSERVATIVE UNDER RONALD REAGAN
VARIABLE THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE TYPE OF NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU LIVE IN
THESE SEEM TO DRIVE THIS MANIFESTATION OF RACISM IN THIS BIG NATIONAL EXPERIMENT WE HAD ON NOVEMBER
MORE OF THE KIND OF NETWORKING THE KIND OF CASUAL INTERACTION THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE ON A DAILY BASIS BUT ALSO NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO LIVE IN CITY CERTAINLY NOT A CITY
IS THIS FAIR ARE WE KIND OF STIGMATIZING PEOPLE FROM ARKANSAS AND THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ANSWER IS IT IS AT LEAST PARTIALLY
IT'S EDUCATION AND THE TYPE OF NEIGHBORS THAT YOU HAVE WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT MORE IN A MOMENT
ABOUT 30 PERCENT PROBABLY BECAUSE IF YOU LIVE ON A FARM YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A LOT OF NEIGHBORS
EXPERIENCE YOU GET WHEN YOU GO TO COLLEGE WHERE YOU DO GET A MIX OF PEOPLE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT INTERACT WITH
SIMPLE QUESTION THEY ASKED IS DOES ANYONE OF THE OPPOSITE RACE LIVE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE CAN SEE IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNITIES THAT THE RESULTS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT IN
ARKANSAS AND TENNESSEE IS THAT THEY'RE BOTH VERY RURAL AND THEY ARE EDUCATIONALLY
PROBE A BIT DEEPER AND GET A BIT MORE PERSONAL IF YOU WILL DO YOU FAVOR A LAW BANNING INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE THERE IS A BIG
WAS A FACTOR MOREOVER IT WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MY DECISION AND PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR
STATES OUT OF THE 50 THEY ASKED QUESTION THAT WAS PRETTY DIRECT ABOUT
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE IN SCHOOL IN ARKANSAS OR TENNESSEE AND MIGHT NEVER INTERACT IN A POSITIVE AFFIRMATIVE WAY WITH SOMEONE FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY OR OF ANOTHER RACIAL GROUP I
HOW OBAMA DID AGAINST HOW JOHN KERRY HAD DONE FOUR YEARS EARLIER
YEAR AND THEY ASK A SERIES OF REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS IN 2000 THEY HAD
WELL IN KANSAS HE LOST BADLY BUT EVERY DEMOCRAT DOES HE LOST NO WORSE THAN MOST PEOPLE DO BUT YEAH WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ARKANSAS {LG}
INTERACTION WITH PEOPLE OF OTHER RACES HAVE COUPLE OF VERY OBVIOUS I SUPPOSE IDEAS FOR MAYBE HOW TO DO
NOT A BIG DIFFERENCE BASED ON WHO YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE AND EVEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT RACE FOR EXAMPLE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WHICH IS KIND OF A
THE PROBLEM IS PERNICIOUS AND AS INTRACTABLE AS RACISM IF WE UNDERSTAND THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE BEHAVIOR AND WHERE IT MANIFESTS ITSELF AND WHERE IT DOESN'T WE CAN START
REALLY NOT EVEN ABOUT URBAN VERSUS RURAL IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU LIVE WITH RACISM IS PREDICTABLE AND IT'S PREDICTED
IS IT JUST ABOUT SOME WEIRD STUFF THAT GOES ON IN ARKANSAS THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND AND KENTUCKY OR ARE THERE MORE SYSTEMATIC FACTORS AT WORK AND SO WE CAN
YES BILL CLINTON WAS FROM ARKANSAS BUT THESE ARE VERY VERY PROFOUND
TAKE YOU UP ON THIS THEY'LL DANCE AROUND A LITTLE WHILE AND TRY TO GRAB THEM BUT THEY CAN'T THE FACT
ME LIEUTENANT COULD YOU COME UP HERE A MINUTE PLEASE SHARPEN YOUR QUILL START COUNTING ONE TWO YOU
OF THE HERBIVORE AND THE REASON THE PLANET IS SO FULL OF HERBIVORES THINK ABOUT AFRICA THINK ABOUT
IF WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANTS TREES BUSHES
GRASS CAN NEVER GET ABOVE WHAT I CALL DIAPER GRASS AND IT
DOES NATURE ACTUALLY WORK HOW NATURE WORKS IS SUNBEAMS COME DOWN IT'S CAPTURED BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CONVERTED INTO
WHAT IF MCDONALD'S SERVED THIS WHAT IF BURGER KING SERVED THIS
EVENTUALLY IT GOES TO WHAT I CALL NURSING HOME GRASS
NATURE BY RESPECTING THE COW NESS OF THE COW
MILK NUTRIENT DENSE FOOD SHE'S DOING EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO
HER AS AN HERBIVORE IN HER HISTORIC ROLE AND PARTICIPATING IN THE NURTURING OF THE PLANET
LOT OF ANALOGIES WE CAN MAKE HERE BUT THE POINT IS
ON GET WITH THE PROGRAM SALATIN WHAT'S THIS GRASS STUFF
WE RODE IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY WE COULD TAKE THE GRASS AND TIE IT IN A KNOT ABOVE THE HORSE'S SADDLE
BUT IN ACTUALITY TREES ARE THE LEAST EFFICIENT
AT ONE TIME NOW THE GRASS GOES THROUGH A
HERBIVORES GROUNDHOGS PRAIRIE DOGS YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
OF STORED CARBON ALL STANDING VISIBLE YOU'RE NOT SEEING 80
IS MORE EFFICIENT YOU KNOW BUSHES AND BRUSH AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND
THEN IT ACCELERATES AND THEN IT GOES INTO SENESCENCE
ALREADY MINED IN VIRGINIA
UP TO THREE FEET OF TOPSOIL WASHED OFF OF VIRGINIA DURING THE EUROPEAN COLONIALIZATION OF THE STATE AND UP UNTIL TODAY AND IT'S STILL WASHING OFF TODAY
BECAUSE WE HAVE TURNED THIS BEAUTIFUL PERENNIAL BASED SYSTEM
THEY PRUNED THIS BACK TO RESTART THIS RAPID BIOMASS PRODUCTION WITHOUT THEM
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE HERBIVORE THE HERBIVORE IS DOING WHAT SHE'S ALWAYS
MIGRATORY PATTERNS WHERE THEY MOVE THOUSANDS OF MILES CREATED THE SOILS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY MINING TODAY IN THE MIDWEST
A CONTINUOUS MOSAIC OF POLLINATION OF
TIMES IN A SEASON AND YOU ADD UP ALL THOSE COUPLE HUNDRED POUNDS OF TIME
ON MOST PASTURES THE GRASS NEVER EVEN CAN GROW TO THIS POINT SO IT'S PRUNED
GOT ALL SORTS OF GROWTH GOING ON BELOW THE GROUND BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE THIS BIOLOGY THE SOIL COOLS DOWN BECAUSE IT'S GOT ALL
SOUTH AMERICA THE ALPACAS THINK ABOUT INDOCHINA
GET MORE AND MORE CHLOROPHYLL THE GROWTH ACCELERATES AND
YET AS ESOTERIC AND MYSTICAL AS SUNBEAMS ARE THEY ARE THE ENERGY DRIVER OF THE PLANET IN A VERY VISCERAL
IT APPROACHES SENESCENCE PRUNE IT BACK JUST LIKE A VITICULTURIST WOULD PRUNE A VINEYARD
AND THEN IT BEGINS TO GROW AND AS THE LEAF AREA BEGINS
THE FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A FOREST YOU'RE SEEING
WAY UP HERE TO FULL PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPRESSION BY DENYING ACCESS WE MOVE THE COWS EVERY DAY TO
NOW THAT COW IS DROPPING 50 POUNDS OF GOODIES OUT HER BACK END EVERY DAY {LG}
TODAY HOW DO WE DUPLICATE THAT IF WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF PRIVATE LAND OWNERSHIP AND ALL THAT
WELL WE DO IT WITH HIGH TECH ELECTRIC FENCING SPACE AGE MICROCHIP ELECTRIC FENCING IT'S
TO DISCOVER WHAT WAS THERE AND WHAT THEY FOUND THEY WROTE BACK AND THEY SPENT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THEY
THIS IS JUVENILE GRASS AND THEN WE COME INTO MORE JUVENILE BUT YOU SEE IT'S STARTING TO BROWN
CYCLE JUST LIKE US JUST LIKE ALL LIVING THINGS IT GOES THROUGH A GROWTH CYCLE IT STARTS SLOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS USING THE HERBIVORE IN THIS CASE A COW IT COULD BE SHEEP A GOAT WHATEVER IN THIS CASE A COW WE'RE USING THE
BUT IF WE CONTROL IT SO THAT THE ANIMALS ONLY
WAY MORE BUT WE'RE SEQUESTERING WAY MORE CARBON
{LG} BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM THIS BIOMASS WOULD
I HAVE TEENAGE GRASS OKAY JUVENILE FAST GROWTH GRASS REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD EAT A HALF GALLON OF
AN ANNUALLY BASED TILLAGE SYSTEM WHICH IS HIGHLY EROSIVE
BY NATURE'S PHOTOVOLTAIC ARRAY CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN PLANTS THROUGH THE CHLOROPHYLL OF PLANTS
THEY CAN SEE WAY BETTER THAN US IN FACT THEY CAN SEE ALL THE WAY AROUND THEIR HEADS EXCEPT FOR 30 DEGREES ON THEIR BACK END SO THEY CAN SEE THIS THEY KNOW IT'S THERE
AND THEY EXPECT THESE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THEM TO DO GREAT WORK I WOULD HOPE AT LEAST AT LEAST GOOD WORK
{LG} WHY IS THAT WHY IS THAT HAPPENING AND WHAT YOU
OFTENTIMES THEY'LL CITE DISTRACTIONS I CAN'T LET SOMEONE WORK AT HOME THEY'LL WATCH TV OR DO THIS OTHER
ENGINEERS THINKERS
THAT PEOPLE REALLY NEED LONG STRETCHES OF UNINTERRUPTED TIME TO GET SOMETHING DONE
YOU CANNOT ASK SOMEBODY TO BE CREATIVE IN 15 MINUTES AND REALLY THINK ABOUT A PROBLEM YOU MIGHT HAVE A QUICK IDEA BUT TO BE
IN DEEP THOUGHT ABOUT A PROBLEM AND REALLY CONSIDER PROBLEM
QUIT I M YOU CAN'T HIDE YOUR MANAGER YOU CAN PUT THESE THINGS AWAY AND THEN YOU CAN BE INTERRUPTED ON YOUR OWN SCHEDULE AT YOUR OWN TIME WHEN YOU'RE AVAILABLE WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GO AGAIN BECAUSE WORK LIKE SLEEP HAPPENS IN PHASES
ACTUALLY GET MEANINGFUL WORK DONE AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT ESPECIALLY WITH CREATIVE PEOPLE DESIGNERS PROGRAMMERS
CAN'T SEE THE PERSON HOW DO KNOW THEY'RE WORKING WHICH IS RIDICULOUS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE EXCUSES THAT MANAGERS GIVE AND I'M ONE OF THESE MANAGERS I UNDERSTAND I KNOW
COMPANIES OFTEN THINK OF A ONE HOUR MEETING AS A ONE HOUR MEETING BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE UNLESS THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON IF THERE ARE 10 PEOPLE IT'S A 10 HOUR MEETING NOT A ONE HOUR MEETING IT'S 10 HOURS OF PRODUCTIVITY TAKEN FROM THE REST OF THE ORGANIZATION TO HAVE THIS ONE HOUR MEETING WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED
SOME WORK AND THEN YOU'LL COME DOWN FROM THAT WORK AND THEN MAYBE IT'S TIME TO CHECK THAT EMAIL OR I M
THERE ARE VERY VERY FEW THINGS THAT ARE THAT URGENT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED RIGHT THIS SECOND
SO IF YOU'RE A MANAGER START ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE MORE THINGS LIKE I M AND EMAIL AND OTHER THINGS THAT SOMEONE CAN PUT AWAY AND THEN GET BACK TO YOU ON THEIR OWN SCHEDULE
AND THE LAST SUGGESTION
FROM ACTIVE COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION WHICH IS LIKE FACE TO FACE STUFF TAPPING PEOPLE ON THE SHOULDER SAYING HI TO THEM HAVING MEETINGS AND REPLACE THAT WITH MORE PASSIVE MODELS OF
ONE IS KIND OF A PLACE OR LOCATION OR A ROOM
ANOTHER ONE IS A MOVING OBJECT AND THIRD IS A TIME SO HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES
I'VE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE THIS QUESTION FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN YOU REALLY NEED TO GET SOMETHING DONE I'LL HEAR THINGS LIKE THE PORCH
THE DECK
THE KITCHEN
I'LL HEAR THINGS LIKE AN EXTRA ROOM IN THE HOUSE THE BASEMENT
THREE HOURS TO YOURSELF AT THE OFFICE TWO HOURS ONE MAYBE VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE LONG STRETCHES OF UNINTERRUPTED TIME AT AN OFFICE AND THIS IS WHY PEOPLE CHOOSE TO DO WORK
DISTRACTIONS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE AND THIS WHOLE PHENOMENON OF HAVING SHORT BURSTS OF TIME TO GET THINGS DONE REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER THING THAT DOESN'T WORK WHEN YOU'RE INTERRUPTED AND THAT IS SLEEP I THINK THAT SLEEP AND WORK
OF THE INTERRUPTIONS AND DISTRACTIONS THAT REALLY CAUSE PEOPLE NOT TO GET WORK DONE ARE INVOLUNTARY SO LET'S GO THROUGH A
CAR OR IN THE TRAIN BECAUSE THERE ARE NO DISTRACTIONS NOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISTRACTIONS BUT NOT THE REALLY
HOME OR THEY MIGHT GO TO THE OFFICE BUT THEY MIGHT GO TO THE OFFICE REALLY EARLY IN THE DAY OR LATE AT NIGHT WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND OR THEY STICK AROUND AFTER
UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF IF YOU'RE INTERRUPTED AND WOKEN UP YOU HAVE TO START AGAIN
SO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK A FEW PHASES AND START AGAIN
AND WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING YOU MIGHT HAVE DAYS LIKE THIS WHERE YOU WAKE UP AT EIGHT OR SEVEN IN THE MORNING OR WHENEVER YOU GET UP AND YOU'RE LIKE
I DIDN'T SLEEP VERY WELL I DID THE SLEEP THING I WENT TO BED I LAID DOWN
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY SLEEP
PEOPLE SAY YOU GO TO
AT THE OFFICE YOU DON'T HAVE A WORK DAY ANYMORE YOU HAVE WORK MOMENTS IT'S LIKE THE FRONT DOOR OF THE OFFICE IS LIKE A CUISINART
PEOPLE ARE READY TO STOP WHAT IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT OR DOING IMPORTANT WORK ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE SO THEY GO INTO A MEETING ROOM THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEY TALK ABOUT STUFF THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS PEOPLE GO TO WORK AND THEY'RE BASICALLY TRADING IN THEIR WORK DAY FOR A SERIES OF WORK MOMENTS THAT'S
I HOPE THAT SOME OF THESE IDEAS WERE AT LEAST PROVOCATIVE ENOUGH FOR MANAGERS AND BOSSES AND BUSINESS OWNERS AND ORGANIZERS AND PEOPLE WHO IN CHARGE OF OTHER PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT LAYING OFF A LITTLE BIT AND GIVING PEOPLE MORE TIME TO GET WORK
TO MAKE THE OFFICE A BETTER PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO WORK SO IT'S NOT THE LAST RESORT BUT IT'S THE FIRST RESORT SO THAT PEOPLE START TO SAY
THE OFFICE SO I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS TO REMEDY THE SITUATION WHAT CAN MANAGERS DO ENLIGHTENED MANAGERS HOPEFULLY WHAT
IT TURNS OUT THOSE AREN'T THE THINGS THAT ARE DISTRACTING BECAUSE THOSE ARE VOLUNTARY DISTRACTIONS YOU DECIDE WHEN YOU WANT TO BE DISTRACTED BY THE TV WHEN YOU WANT TO TURN SOMETHING ON WHEN YOU
THEY TEND TO INTERRUPT YOU THAT'S KIND OF BAD BUT WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS THE THING THAT MANAGERS DO MOST OF ALL WHICH IS CALL MEETINGS AND MEETINGS ARE JUST TOXIC TERRIBLE POISONOUS THINGS DURING THE DAY AT
TO TALK ABOUT WORK SPECIFICALLY WHY PEOPLE CAN'T SEEM TO GET WORK DONE AT WORK
THAN A COMPUTER BETTER THAN A NEW MONITOR BETTER THAN NEW SOFTWARE OR WHATEVER PEOPLE TYPICALLY USE GIVING THEM FOUR HOURS OF QUIET TIME AT THE OFFICE IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY
THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S WHY PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING WORK DONE BECAUSE THEY'RE ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER THAT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS IT'S A
INTERRUPTING YOU AT THE WRONG TIME WHILE YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THEY'RE PAYING YOU TO DO
OR GO IN ON THE WEEKENDS OR THEY GET WORK DONE ON THE PLANE IN
REALLY WANT TO GET STUFF DONE I GO TO THE OFFICE BECAUSE THE OFFICES WELL EQUIPPED EVERYTHING IS THERE FOR THEM TO DO THE WORK BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO THERE RIGHT NOW SO HOW DO WE CHANGE
IT IN HALF JUST THE AFTERNOON I'LL MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU SO JUST THE AFTERNOON ONE THURSDAY FIRST THURSDAY OF THE MONTH JUST THE AFTERNOON NOBODY IN THE OFFICE CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER JUST SILENCE THAT'S
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS IF YOU LISTEN TO ALL THE PLACES THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DOING WORK LIKE AT HOME IN THE
LATE AT NIGHT OR EARLY IN THE MORNING YOU DON'T FIND MANAGERS AND MEETINGS YOU FIND A LOT OF OTHER DISTRACTIONS BUT NOT MANAGERS AND MEETINGS SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T FIND ELSEWHERE BUT YOU DO FIND AT THE OFFICE
AND MANAGERS ARE BASICALLY PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO
MAYBE A FEW OTHER THINGS AND THEY EXPECT THEIR EMPLOYEES OR THEIR VOLUNTEERS TO COME TO THAT LOCATION EVERY DAY TO DO GREAT WORK
PLACES YOU CAN HAVE INTERRUPTIONS LIKE THE TV OR YOU COULD GO FOR A WALK OR THERE'S A FRIDGE
RELATED NOT BECAUSE YOU CAN WORK WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING AND SLEEP WHILE YOU'RE WORKING THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I MEAN I'M TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT SLEEP AND WORK ARE PHASE BASED OR STAGE BASED
{LG} WE ALL KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE AND YOU WOULD NEVER SEE A SPONTANEOUS MEETING CALLED BY EMPLOYEES IT DOESN'T WORK THAT
WILL HAVE MORE OPEN MORNING THEY CAN ACTUALLY THINK YOU'LL FIND OUT ALL THESE THINGS YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD TO DO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO SO THOSE ARE JUST THREE QUICK
NO ONE CARED ABOUT LETTING PEOPLE TAKE A SMOKE BREAK FOR 15 MINUTES 10 YEARS AGO SO WHY DOES ANYONE CARE IF SOMEONE GOES TO FACEBOOK OR TWITTER OR YOUTUBE HERE AND THERE THOSE AREN'T THE REAL PROBLEMS IN THE
THAT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK GETS DONE WHEN NO ONE TALKS TO EACH OTHER THIS IS WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET STUFF DONE IS WHEN NO ONE'S BOTHERING THEM OR INTERRUPTING THEM GIVING SOMEONE FOUR HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED TIME IS THE BEST GIFT YOU CAN GIVE ANYBODY AT WORK IT'S
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME SO WHAT ARE THE INTERRUPTIONS THAT HAPPEN AT THE OFFICE BUT NOT AT OTHER PLACES
YOU LOOK BACK ON THE DAY AND YOU REALIZE THAT YOU DIDN'T GET ANYTHING DONE WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH THIS WE PROBABLY WENT THROUGH IT YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE THE DAY BEFORE THAT YOU LOOK BACK ON YOUR DAY AND YOU'RE LIKE I GOT NOTHING DONE TODAY
THEY RENT BUILDING OR THEY LEASE SOME SPACE AND THEY FILL THIS SPACE WITH STUFF THEY FILL IT WITH TABLES OR DESKS
THEY'RE FOR INTERRUPTING PEOPLE THEY DON'T REALLY DO THE WORK SO THEY MAKE SURE EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING WORK WHICH IS AN INTERRUPTION
COMMODITY IN THE WORLD SECOND ONLY TO CRUDE OIL IT'S THE SECOND MOST POPULAR DRINK IN THE WORLD WATER IS NUMBER ONE AND IT'S BEEN CREDITED WITH USHERING IN THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT YET 95 OF
WE'VE EVOLVED FROM A HANDFUL OF SPIRITUAL SEEKERS CONSUMING THIS BEVERAGE TO TODAY WHERE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES ALL AROUND THE WORLD DRINK COFFEE EVERY MORNING
CHEMICAL REACTIONS THAT TAKE PLACE JUST THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE
WE DON'T HAVE A MINUTE LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT FOR 10 SECONDS 1500 DIFFERENT CHEMICAL REACTIONS
THE SEEDS ARE COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED FROM THEIR DRIED GREEN INERT STATE
TO THEIR ALIVE FRESH ROASTED STATE
WHERE THEY CAN BE ASSIMILATED BY OUR BODIES
COFFEE IS A FRESH FOOD AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY NOW DURING THE ROASTING PROCESS THERE ARE OVER
AND LIKE ALL HOME ROASTERS I STARTED TO LOOK AROUND MY HOUSE WAYS TO ROAST COFFEE
HOME ROASTERS WE ARE AN INNOVATIVE WACKY BUNCH WE TURN ORDINARY HOUSEHOLD
APPLIANCES
INTO COFFEE ROASTERS
HAIRDRYERS HEAT GUNS HOT AIR POPCORN POPPERS
SOME SMOKE OUT THEIR ROOMMATES USING A PAN ON THE STOVE
I LOOKED AROUND MY HOUSE
AND TO ATTAIN HIGHER STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS THEY WERE DRINKING COFFEE
18000 DOLLARS FOLKS TECHNOLOGY FOR ROASTING COFFEE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE YOU JUST NEED
BUT THIS TIME PERIOD IS SEVERAL HOURS
NOT DAYS NOT WEEKS LIKE SOME OF THE MASS COFFEE PRODUCERS CLAIM
MY OWN TESTS HAD DETERMINED A PEAK POTENCY TIME FOR ESPRESSO
OF 11 HOURS AFTER ROASTING
AND A MAXIMUM FRESHNESS CUT OFF DATE
OF 7 DAYS AFTER ROASTING
HOW CAN I CREATE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS HOW CAN I HAVE THE BEST
FRESHEST COFFEE AND
SUPPLY TO THE MASSES
MY ANSWER
IS IN CREATING A COFFEE ROASTER
THAT EVERY CAFE IN THE WORLD CAN AFFORD AND HAVE ACCESS TO
ARE ACTUALLY TWO CRACKS WHEN THE LOUDER SECOND CRACK IS JUST BEGINNING TURN OFF THE HEAT YOU START THE COOLING
AND IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION COMMERCIAL COFFEE CULTURES ROAST THEIR
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS NOT MUCH PROGRESS AND ACQUIRING AN ITALIAN ESPRESSO MACHINE AND A BURR GRINDER
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TRY IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO ME THAT THE ROASTED COFFEE I WAS USING MADE THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE EVERYTHING I TRIED IN ITS VACUUM SEALED SPACE AGE PACKAGING
ALL TASTED THE
AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO THE MASSES ARE YOU READY FOR THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT 2 0
I BELIEVE IT IS A POWERFUL SUPER FOOD WHEN CONSUMED FRESH THAT CAN HELP HUMANKIND DO THE SAME BUT PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT DON'T LISTEN
IT'S MY MISSION TO RECAPTURE THE MYSTICAL POWERFUL EFFECTS OF FRESH ROASTED
SOME VERY LIGHT BUT STILL BECAUSE IT WAS FRESH IT WAS THE BEST COFFEE I HAD EVER HAD SO I WAS REALLY ENCOURAGED {LG}
THIS MORNING YES YOU AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF OTHERS LIKE YOU AROUND THE WORLD WHICH MAKES COFFEE ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANKIND
FRESH ROASTED ORGANIC ARABICA COFFEE ENHANCES MY ABILITY TO FOCUS MY THOUGHTS AND ATTENTION TO CREATE AND MANIFEST MY DREAMS
ONE PRODUCES COFFEE THAT IS ALIVE VITAL POTENT THE OTHER PRODUCES COFFEE THAT SITS ON THE SHELVES FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS AND IS OLD STALE
WE DO KNOW IS THAT COFFEE'S EARLY USES HELD A MYSTICAL AND SPIRITUAL IMPORTANCE AMONG MANY CULTURES INITIALLY COFFEE WAS PREPARED AND CONSUMED AS PART OF RELIGIOUS
STUDIES WHAT ARE THEY STUDYING THEY'RE STUDYING OLD DEAD STALE COFFEE OR PEOPLE WHO DRINK OLD STALE DEAD COFFEE I HAVE NOT SEEN A SINGLE STUDY THAT HAS USED COFFEE WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF ROASTING LET ALONE ITS PEAK TIME OR WITHIN 24 HOURS
I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND HOW IT FEELS IN MY BODY AND TESTS ARE DONE FOR MYSELF THERE ARE SO MANY MORE HEALTH BENEFITS
THAT HAVE NOT
EVEN
BEEN DISCOVERED YET NOT EVEN TOUCHED YET
THESE REPORTS
ARE SHOWING THAT COFFEE HAS A LOT OF HEALTH BENEFITS IT'S THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS IN THE US DIET
A STUDY JUST CAME OUT IN THE LAST WEEK THAT SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO DRANK COFFEE
TENDED TO LIVE LONGER
THERE IS A LOT MORE TO DISCOVER ABOUT COFFEE EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG
NOW IS THE TIME TO WAKE UP {LG}
TIME FOR REVOLUTION AND A REINVENTION OF THE WAY WE GROW PROCESS AND PREPARE OUR
FRESH ROASTED COFFEE THAT THEY ROASTED AT HOME IN THEIR HOT AIR POPCORN POPPER I HAD NOT IDEA WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AT THE TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING I DECIDED I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE I'LL GIVE IT A
90 OF THESE SEEDS THESE CHERRIES HAVE TWO SEEDS THEY ARE THE FEMALES AND ONLY 5 10 HAVE ONE SEED THE MALE ONCE ROASTED THEY TASTE DIFFERENT ONE IS MORE BITTER THAN
COFFEE ONCE ROASTED IS A FRESH LIVING FOOD
AND LOSES ITS VITALITY AND DIES IN ABOUT A WEEK
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S VACUUM SEALED NITROGEN FLUSHED ANY OTHER FANCY PACKAGING PROCESS NOTHING CAN PREVENT ITS DEATH
AND STORING IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR OR
AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE STARTS WITH TELLING THEIR STORIES SO WHEN I MEET REFUGEES I ALWAYS ASK THEM QUESTIONS
TOLD ME EVERY DAY I WOULD SAY TO HIM EVERY MORNING HONEY PLEASE DON'T GO TO SCHOOL AND WHEN HE INSISTED
HANY IS ONE OF 50 MILLION PEOPLE UPROOTED IN THIS WORLD TODAY
THAT DAY THEY JOINED THE BIGGEST POPULATION OF REFUGEES IN THE WORLD
I MISS MYSELF MY FRIENDS
WERE SLIT IT WAS TIME TO FLEE THEY LEFT THAT DAY RIGHT AWAY IN THEIR CAR HANY HIDDEN IN THE BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE FACING CHECKPOINTS OF MENACING SOLDIERS
BIT OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY IS LUXURY BUT LEAVE HIM TO LANGUISH
FORGET WHAT HE TOLD ME WHEN WE ENDED OUR CONVERSATION THAT DAY HE SAID TO ME IF I AM NOT A STUDENT I AM NOTHING
HANY'S STORY IS A TRAGEDY {NS} {NS} BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO END THAT WAY THANK YOU
SCHOOLING DAYS ARE OVER AND I THOUGHT THERE MUST BE SOME
AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS MAKING ME SMILE OH OH I HAD SO MANY DREAMS THAT WERE ABOUT TO BE REALIZED
SO I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO HANY WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS GOING TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO YOU HERE ON THE TED STAGE HE ALLOWED ME TO READ YOU A
WOULD RISK HIS LIFE TO GET THAT DIPLOMA ON HIS WAY TO SCHOOL HE WOULD DODGE SNIPERS HIS CLASSROOM SOMETIMES SHOOK WITH THE SOUND OF BOMBS AND SHELLING
A TOWN A CITY OR A VILLAGE THAT IS NOT HOST TO SYRIAN REFUGEES
I'M REMINDED OF A RECENT VISIT I TOOK TO A SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN NORTHERN IRAQ AND I
DISPLACED SO WHILE WE'RE MAKING SWEEPING PROGRESS IN HUMAN HEALTH
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THEIR LIVES WHY
THIS IS GENEROSITY AND HUMANITY THAT IS REMARKABLE
THIS BE REBUILT BY THE PEOPLE WITH THE LARGEST STAKE THE SOCIETIES IN EXILE THE REFUGEES
ALL AFRAID BUT OUR DETERMINATION TO GRADUATE IS STRONGER THAN OUR
ARE MORE AND MORE VICTIMS {NS} EVERY DAY ON AVERAGE BY THE END OF THIS DAY
IS WHEN HER FACE TURNED BLANK AND SHE SAID TO ME I HAVE NO FUTURE
SHE SAID I WOULD HUG HIM AS IF IT WERE FOR THE LAST TIME BUT HE SAID TO HIS
AND IT'S THE REFUGEES WHO CAN STOP THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE
SHOULD BE AND SHE IS THE FUTURE OF SOMALIA
TO MY COLLEAGUE AND SHE CONFIRMED TO ME THERE IS NO FUNDING FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THIS CAMP
FUNDS ARE PRIORITIZED FOR THE BASICS IN LIFE TENTS AND BLANKETS AND MATTRESSES AND KITCHEN SETS FOOD RATIONS
SINCE WORLD WAR II HAVE SO MANY
TRANSFORMATION IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE BUT I'M REMINDED OF THE TERRIBLE WAR IN SOMALIA THAT HAS BEEN RAGING ON FOR 22
STARTED WORKING WITH REFUGEES BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE A
IN HIS NEW UNIVERSITY IN FLORIDA PURSUING HIS PH D IN PUBLIC HEALTH
TO HELP THE VICTIMS AND WE ARE DOING FAR TOO LITTLE TO STOP AND PREVENT THE WARS THAT ARE DRIVING THEM FROM THEIR HOMES
CAN TRIUMPH OVER THEIR TRAUMA AND TRAIN FOR THE DAY THAT THEY CAN GO HOME AS AGENTS OF POSITIVE CHANGE
AND MOST TROUBLING OF ALL IS THAT ONLY 20 PERCENT OF SYRIAN REFUGEE CHILDREN ARE IN SCHOOL
MOTHER AND HIS FATHER AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY WERE KILLED THAT DAY ONLY HIS COUSIN SURVIVED AND THE TWO OF THEM
BUT HIS LIFE CHANGED WHEN HE GOT THE CHANCE TO BE RESETTLED TO THE UNITED STATES AND HE FOUND LOVE IN A FOSTER FAMILY
THE IMPRESSION THAT PROPORTIONALLY HUGE NUMBERS OF REFUGEES ARE COMING TO THEIR COUNTRY BUT THE REALITY
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD SHOULD RECOGNIZE
THE HUMANITY AND THE GENEROSITY OF THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE HOSTING SO MANY REFUGEES
AND ALL COUNTRIES SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE FLEEING WAR AND PERSECUTION ARRIVES AT A CLOSED BORDER
A SYRIAN REFUGEE BOY I KNOW TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN'T HESITATE WHEN HIS LIFE WAS IN IMMINENT DANGER
WARS GOING ON AND ON THE AVERAGE TIME A REFUGEE WILL SPEND IN EXILE IS 17 YEARS
NEED TO BE REBUILT BY ARCHITECTS BY ENGINEERS BY ELECTRICIANS
TALKING TO THE CHILDREN AND THEN I SAW THIS GIRL ACROSS THE ROOM WHO LOOKED TO ME TO BE THE SAME AGE AS MY OWN DAUGHTER AND I WENT UP AND TALKED TO HER
I BELIEVE HOW WE TREAT THE UPROOTED WILL SHAPE THE FUTURE OF OUR WORLD THE VICTIMS OF WAR CAN HOLD THE KEYS TO LASTING PEACE
ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A QUIET PLACE WHERE NOBODY HURTS YOU
HE WAS ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND HE WANTED ME TO SHARE WITH YOU THIS PROUD
IN EDUCATION AND DESIGN WE ARE DOING DANGEROUSLY LITTLE
REFUGEES HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO PREPARE FOR THEIR RETURN YOU MIGHT
AUNT HIS UNCLE AND HIS COUSIN WERE MURDERED IN THEIR HOMES FOR REFUSING TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE
WHO BOMBED YOUR HOUSE WHO KILLED YOUR SON DID THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY MAKE IT OUT ALIVE HOW ARE YOU COPING IN YOUR LIFE IN EXILE
THEM THRIVE WE SHOULD THINK OF REFUGEE CAMPS AND COMMUNITIES AS MORE THAN JUST TEMPORARY POPULATION
THE GULF OF MEXICO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WATER THAT CAN BE FOUR KILOMETERS DEEP TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE ONE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK
PROVIDES SCIENTISTS WITH ACCESS TO DEEP WATER VESSELS AND ROVS AT LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD
MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR ROV PILOTS TO JUDGE JUST HOW FAR AWAY THEY WERE FROM THE OBJECTS THEY HAD TO INTERACT WITH
THE SOLUTION WAS 3D TV
OCEANEERING ARE NOW EQUIPPING SOME OF THEIR ROVS WITH 3D CAMERAS AND WHEN THEY AIM THOSE CAMERAS AT DEEP SEA ANIMALS THE VIDEO THEY CAPTURE IS SPECTACULAR
IT REALLY SEEMS TO INSPIRE THE CHILDREN WHO SEE IT TO WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DEEP SEA
FINDING DOWN THERE ALMOST EVERY DIVE RESULTS IN SOMETHING UNEXPECTED OR INTERESTING
HAS THE ROVS SCIENTISTS HAVE A NEED TO EXPLORE THE DEPTHS IS THERE WAY WE CAN COLLABORATE
THEN WE COULD TRULY BEGIN TO UNLOCK SOME OF THE MYSTERIES OF THE DEEP
IT ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY
THERE'S SOME BIG CHALLENGES AHEAD
THE PRICE OF OIL IS DROPPING
I KNOW IT FEELS GOOD AT THE PUMP
BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT EACH MONTH THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER RIGS AND ROVS OPERATING IN THE GULF
DEEP SEA EXPLORATION COULD BE ONE OF THE CASUALTIES
DESPITE THIS I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE THIS IS AN AMAZING PARTNERSHIP THAT'S YIELDING INCREDIBLE DATA
WHEN I
HOPE THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO VIEW THESE VIDEOS WILL BE INSPIRED TO CONTINUE THIS VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY THANK YOU
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK FOR IT UNTIL WE PARTNERED WITH INDUSTRY
STILL AMAZES ME MANY ANIMALS IN THE DEEP SEA HAVE
BROUGHT THEM FACE TO FACE WITH UNFAMILIAR ANIMALS AND BIRDS
OVER TIME WE EXPLORED OUR NEW HOME
AND BY NOW WE'VE PROBABLY DISCOVERED AND IDENTIFIED ALL OF THE LARGE ANIMALS AND BIRDS THAT INHABIT THE REGION
THE SAME CAN PROBABLY BE SAID FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
TODAY WE LIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE
INSTITUTION BUT THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO FEW MANNED RESEARCH SUBMARINES IN THE WORLD
HAVE SELDOM BEEN OBSERVED ANYWHERE NEVER IN THE GULF OF MEXICO UNTIL SERPENT
IT'S ALSO TOO COLD TOO DARK AND TOO REMOTE TO EXPLORE IT
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE EQUATED THE RIGHT TO HEALTH WITH FREE MEDICAL CARE
AND EVEN THOUGH THE RIGHT TO HEALTH HAD BEEN GIVEN LIP SERVICE UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW
FEW BELIEVED IT WAS A RIGHT THAT COULD EVER TRULY BE FULFILLED
MUCH LESS LEGALLY ENFORCED
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN A NON DISCRIMINATORY WAY TO EVERYONE
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE
BUT MAKING THE RIGHT TO HEALTH REAL
IS NOT JUST ABOUT DEFINING TERMS AND SIGNING INTERNATIONAL TREATIES
TAKING A BELIEF
AND MAKING IT REAL
IS HARD
IT MEANS ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IS NEEDED
AND HOW FAR ARE WE WILLING TO GO TO MAKE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH A REALITY ON THE GROUND
IN MY COUNTRY
AFTER THE LAW PASSED
I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT HIS COST WOULD TRIPLE
THIS IS WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT IS NEEDED FOR THE RIGHT TO HEALTH
AND HOW FAR WE ARE WILLING TO GO
MY HUSBAND NEEDED HEALTH INSURANCE AND I BELIEVED IN THE RIGHT TO HEALTH
BUT THE QUESTION OF
MEANS ACCESS TO TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CARE
BUT ALSO THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH
LIKE CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION
FOOD
AND HOUSING
THE RIGHT TO HEALTH ALSO MEANS THAT HIGH QUALITY AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE
AND WE NEEDED HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE HAD A SHOT AT HEALTH PROTECTION I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THIS WAS
STATES BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OVER 41 MILLION PEOPLE WERE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE
WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH THEN AND PARTICIPATING IN THAT CONVERSATION CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY CAREER BACK THEN
TWO THIRDS OF THE WORLD'S CONSTITUTIONS INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW THE RIGHT TO
COVERAGE COMES AT A COST ABOUT A QUARTER OF ALL NON ELDERLY AMERICANS DON'T HAVE THE ASSETS IT WOULD TAKE FOR A MID RANGE INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE WHEN I LOOKED INTO
AND AFTER HE BEGAN WRITING ABOUT IT
THINGS BEGAN TO CHANGE
ACADEMICS
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS GOVERNMENTS NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CIVIL SOCIETY ALL BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AS SOMETHING TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY
SINCE THEN
EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
HAS
BUT MY MOTIVE WAS I WANTED TO WRITE BOOK I'D ALREADY WRITTEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL BOOK IN THE UK IN WHICH I WON A 100 BET I HAD TO
BUT IT WORKS REALLY WELL AND THEN LAST YEAR WE MADE A FEATURE FILM PLAYING THE MOLDOVANS AT TENNIS
HOW DO WE HELP THEM WE HELP THEM BY STEERING THEM TOWARDS THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL
MANY PEOPLE
ACTUALLY THINK
THAT IT IS A GOOD THING
THAT ONE PERSON CAN HAVE 74 BILLION DOLLARS
AND THERE CAN BE ALL THOSE PEOPLE WITH SO LITTLE
HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO IN THEIR HEARTS KNOW THAT THIS IS WRONG
BUT WHAT THEY THINK IS THAT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM
TO THE WAY WE MANAGE OURSELVES IN THE WORLD
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THERE ARE OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD APART FROM PEOPLE MAKING MONEY UNICEF WORLD BANK THEY'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE ARE 1 1 BILLION IN DEVELOPING
AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BAD PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THAT AND MANY OF THEM
GREAT SPEED WE'VE SURVIVED BECAUSE WE COOPERATED AND WERE SYMPATHETIC TO ONE ANOTHER
THE TWO DOCTORS I'D STAYED WITH WHEN I FIRST CAME TO MOLDOVA DIANA AND GREGORIE AND I SAID WHAT SHOULD WE DO WE HAVE SOME MONEY THEY SAID LET'S OPEN A CARE CENTER FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY HERE IN CHI IN U AND THAT'S WHAT
SHOULD LIVE TELLING THEM SO CREATIVITY WAS CRUSHED THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT WASN'T THERE GENERALLY SPEAKING AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT THAT DIDN'T WORK
OTHER THAN JUST PROFIT FOR BIG BUSINESS WE CANNOT GO ON LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE MATHS DON'T WORK SO HOW DO WE CREATE A DIFFERENT A BIG GROUND SWIRL A CHANGE
SOCIETY DECIDES IT CAPS HOW MUCH AN INDIVIDUAL CAN EARN IN ONE YEAR NOW THAT MIGHT BE 500000 EUROS IT MIGHT BE 1 MILLION EUROS
CONSUMING THE WAY WE ARE NOW THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE PLANET CONSUMING THAT THEY WILL BE CONSUMING 2 3 WORTH OF PLANETS AND THE TROUBLE IS
ECONOMIES KEEP GROWING AND IN ORDER FOR ECONOMIES TO GROW WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS PEOPLE ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO CONSUME MORE AND MORE
AND WE DO SOMETHING QUITE CLEVER WE DO SOMETHING SMARTER THAN JUST TAXING THE HELL OUT OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN TRIED
SEROTONIN IS INCREASED IN OUR BRAIN SEROTONIN IS WHAT MAKES US FEEL GOOD SO THERE IS A HEALTH BENEFIT TO THIS SO WHEN I WAS ASKED TO COME AND DO THIS TALK TODAY I THOUGHT
VOTES FOR WOMEN WERE INTRODUCED IN MOST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AS A RESULT OF JUST WANTING TO CHANGE THERE'S UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF
THINK OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE THE HIGHEST SOCIETAL VALUE THEY
LIFE WHEN I COME OVER AND I SEE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE I SEE THE SMILES ON THE FACES OF THE
PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN I MEET THE CHILDREN
I ACTUALLY FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF
MY SELF ESTEEM
HAS GONE UP SINCE I DID THIS I
UNDOUBTEDLY I FEEL HAPPIER
IT COMPULSORY FOR US TO PAY TAX YOU'VE MADE IT COMPULSORY FOR US TO HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE YOU'VE MADE IT COMPULSORY FOR US TO INSURE OUR
AND YET LOOK AT THE DISHARMONY THAT WE HAVE IN THE WORLD AND WORK OUT WHY THAT IS
SO TO ME I THINK THE ARGUMENTS FOR NEW EQUALITY
ARE PRETTY STRONG BUT
THEY'RE JUST
MY IDEAS I WANTED TO CREATE A FORUM WHERE PEOPLE COULD VOTE ON
PRETTY GOOD PRETTY LAUDABLE BUT THAT'S JUST 58 OUT OF 1226 SO WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE ENCOURAGEMENT {LG}
JUST THINK OF ALL THE DODGY DEALINGS THAT GO ON AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET AHEAD DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT IS THIS NAVE AM I BEING A NAVE DREAMER
YOU VERY MUCH I'M DELIGHTED TO BE BACK HERE IN CHI IN U I CAME HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1998 TO WIN A CRAZY BET AND THE BET
NOW IT'S A BIG CHANGE COULD IT BE DONE WELL THERE'S EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT ACTUALLY CHANGE CAN HAPPEN IN THE WORLD WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS MOTIVATED BY
BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT SUCCESS IS BEING RICH AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WORKING EVERY HOUR GOD HAS GIVEN THEM SO THAT THEY CAN JUST MAKE MONEY AND THEY'RE NOT SPENDING TIME WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THIS KIND OF STUFF
THAT'S 30 MORE THAN NOW NOW IF
DON'T WE MAKE IT COMPULSORY TO DO GOOD WITH YOUR MONEY
EVERYBODY WINS
SO
I'VE STARTED A LITTLE WEB SITE MAKEBILLIONAIRESHISTORY COM YOU CAN SIMPLY GO THERE YOU CLICK ON WHETHER YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA YES OR NO THERE'S A FORUM LET'S GET A DEBATE
BUT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS TOO
THERE WOULD BE A HUGE NEW SECTOR CREATED IN THE ECONOMY
THE CHARITABLE SECTOR WOULD BECOME HUGE
YOUNG PEOPLE COULD GET JOBS GOING OUT TO WORK FOR THESE CHARITIES AND DOING THINGS IN SOCIETY THAT HELPED THEIR FELLOW PEOPLE
WENT TO WORK IN THE MORNING KNOWING THAT THEY WERE CONTRIBUTING TO THE WELL BEING OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS RATHER THAN CONTRIBUTING TO THE HUGE WEALTH OF A MULTINATIONAL OR BILLIONAIRE DARE I SAY
AND THIS DIDN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A BIG DEAL TO ME BECAUSE THIS JUST SEEMED FAIR I WAS COMING TO MOLDOVA TO GATHER THE MATERIAL I SHOULD SHARE WITH IT AND I ALSO
JUST PLAYING AND WINNING AT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN WHICH IS THE GAME OF CAPITALISM
THERE WAS ANOTHER WORD HE USED IN THE DESCENT OF MAN LOVE HE USED IT 95 TIMES
ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AND THERE'S PLENTY OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT THE MORE EQUALITY THERE IS IN A COUNTRY THE BENEFITS ARE
ANYTHING EARNED ABOVE THIS CAP
THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO DONATE TO CHARITY
OR BETTER STILL
THEY FORM
THEIR OWN CHARITY
BUT TAXATION IS PAID AS NORMAL
TO THE GOVERNMENT SO THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LOSE OUT ON REVENUE AND SERVICES WON'T HAVE TO BE CUT
DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY THAT THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND ON THIS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE LINING THEIR POCKETS I'M NOT INTERESTED I'M OUT OF HERE
ACTUALLY OUT THERE SO I HAD A LOOK I KNOW THAT MILLIONAIRE HOUSEHOLDS IN THE USA THERE'S 5 1 MILLION IN JAPAN 6 MILLION CHINA GROWING ALL THE TIME MORE AND MORE MILLIONAIRE
HERE I WAS IN THE POOREST COUNTRY IN EUROPE AND I WAS TRYING TO GATHER MATERIAL FOR MY BOOK AND I WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO THE UNITED KINGDOM PUBLISH THIS BOOK AND PROFIT FROM IT
FOR MAKING THE FILM PLAYING THE MOLDOVANS AT TENNIS WAS SO THAT WE COULD BUILD A BIGGER CARE CENTER WHICH WE STARTED TO BUILD HERE IN CHI IN U AND THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME AND IT MAKES ME HAPPIER I FEEL BETTER
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE ARE DOING IN OUT TIME IS
EVERYTHING IT CAN TO REVERSE THIS TREND LACK OF SIDEWALKS
FOR THEIR LEISURE TIME IS PUBLIC PEDESTRIAN SPACE
HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO ROAD SPACE AS SOMEBODY
WITH A LUXURY CAR
WE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER
THAT IN NO CONSTITUTION
PARKING IS A RIGHT
PARKING IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
THEREFORE
GOVERNMENT HAS NO MORE OBLIGATION
TO PROVIDE PARKING
TO SOMEBODY WHO BUYS A CAR
THAN IT WOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE A HOUSE TO SOMEBODY
TO PARK CARS THAN TO HUMAN BEINGS AS WE DO IN MOST OF THE CITIES IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHEN DISTRIBUTING ROAD SPACE THAT A LOW INCOME
FOR A SPORTS FIELD
BECAUSE PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS AS VERY IMPORTANT
ACTUALLY
IT IS DURING
LEISURE TIME THAT
INEQUALITY IS FELT
DURING WORK TIME THE HIGH INCOME PERSON OR THE LOW INCOME PERSON GO TO WORK THEY MEET THEIR FRIENDS
THEY ARE MORE OR LESS EQUALLY SATISFIED OR DISSATISFIED
THE DIFFERENCE IS FELT WHEN THEY GO INTO THEIR LEISURE TIME
THE HIGH INCOME PERSON GOES TO A LARGE HOME WITH ACCESS TO GARDENS WITH ACCESS TO VACATIONS TO COUNTRY CLUBS TO
RESTAURANTS TO CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
WE CAN CREATE IT CONSTRUCT IT AND I AM SURE WE YOU YOUNG PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE GOING TO CREATE MUCH BETTER CITIES WHICH WILL FOSTER MORE EQUALITY
GO TO SOLVE THEIR HOUSING NEEDS IN THE WRONG PLACES WITHOUT ADEQUATE PUBLIC SPACES AND SOMETIMES EVEN LEGAL
REPLACE PUBLIC SPACE THEREFORE INEQUALITY CAUSES MUCH OF THE CITY'S PROBLEMS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND A GOOD CITY IS A VERY POWERFUL MEANS TO CONSTRUCT EQUALITY AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW
A PUBLIC PARK
IN A GOOD CITY
WATERFRONTS ARE NEVER PRIVATE
THEY ARE ALL ALWAYS PUBLIC HAVE PUBLIC ACCESS AND HAVE GOOD PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ENJOY THEM
BUT
THAT A CITY IS ILL
CLEARLY
IN A SHOPPING MALL ONE CANNOT SEE OR FEEL THE CHARACTER OF THE CITY ONE CANNOT SEE THE MOUNTAINS OR THE TREES OR THE ARCHITECTURE
INSIDE THE MALL ONE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S DAY OR NIGHT
TEMPERATURE IN MALLS IS ALWAYS KEPT THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE IN WINTER IN MOSCOW OR IN TROPICAL SINGAPORE
AND WITH GLOBALIZATION
THEY SEGREGATE PEOPLE BY INCOME ONE CANNOT GO ACROSS THEM THEY HAVE NO PUBLIC PARKS THEY CLEARLY DAMAGE THE CITY
AS JAN GEHL WOULD SAY THE SPACE BETWEEN BUILDINGS
WE COULD FIND OIL OR DIAMONDS UNDERGROUND
AND IT WOULD NOT BE SO VALUABLE AS ROAD SPACE
HERE WE CAN SEE
HOW THIS ROAD SPACE IS DISTRIBUTED IN LONDON WE GIVE MORE SPACE TO PEDESTRIANS THAN TO MOTORED VEHICLES
A CRUCIAL IDEOLOGICAL QUESTION IS
HOW TO DISTRIBUTE ROAD SPACE
HOW TO DISTRIBUTE ROAD
GREAT PUBLIC TRANSPORT THAT EVEN THE WEALTHY PREFER TO USE IT INSTEAD OF USING PRIVATE CARS AND THEREFORE THEY MEET
IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT MAKES US HUMAN BEINGS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BEINGS IN THE PLANET IT IS
THAT PEOPLE WITH CARS ARE FIRST CLASS CITIZENS WHILE THOSE WHO WALK ARE THIRD CLASS
INTO PUBLIC PARKS FOR EXAMPLE IN KIBERA IN NAIROBI YOU
WHY NOT A CITY WITH HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS OF
THAT THE MAIN CAUSE FOR THE DEFORMATION OF CITIES IS INEQUALITY
BUT
ON THE OTHER HAND
A GOOD CITY IS A VERY POWERFUL MEANS TO CONSTRUCT EQUALITY
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
WILL NOT NECESSARILY BRING ABOUT
GOOD
80 PASSENGERS SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO 80 TIMES MORE ROAD SPACE THAN A CAR WITH ONE AND THEY SHOULD GO ON EXCLUSIVE BUS LANES WHICH IS ALSO THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF USING ROAD SPACE BESIDES
ONE FOR MOTOR VEHICLES THIS IS VERY EASY TO INCORPORATE INTO THE DESIGN OF NEW AREAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED
AND THIS OF COURSE DAMAGES THE CITY SHOPPING MALLS
A VERY POWERFUL SYMBOL OF DEMOCRACY BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT A CITIZEN ON A 30 DOLLAR BICYCLE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS ONE
ABOUT IT TODAY IN A GOOD CITY
MUCH RELATED
TO CITIES
THE FIRST ONE IS QUALITY OF LIFE EQUALITY
THAT EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY CHILDREN
REGARDLESS OF INCOME
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS NOT ONLY TO GOOD EDUCATION OR HEALTH
BUT ALSO TO SPORTS FACILITIES MUSIC LESSONS GREEN SPACES
AND THE SECOND KIND OF EQUALITY
IS WHAT I WOULD CALL DEMOCRATIC EQUALITY THE FIRST ARTICLE
IN EVERY CONSTITUTION STATES
THAT ALL CITIZENS ARE EQUAL
IF THIS IS TRUE THEN
CLEARLY A CITIZEN ON A BICYCLE HAS THE SAME RIGHT TO ROAD SPACE AS ONE
BUT FOR CITY TO GROW IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT IS NECESSARY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE HOW LAND IS USED IF NECESSARY BY ACQUIRING IT AND IF NECESSARY THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN
THEY COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE AND IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF ORGANIZING THIS CITY
UNLESS WE THINK THAT ONLY THOSE WITH ACCESS TO A MOTOR
HAPPIER IF A DEMOCRATIC DECISION WAS MADE TO TURN ALL WATERFRONTS INTO PUBLIC SPACES IN
GOOD PUBLIC SPACES THE POOR SUFFER AND THE WEALTHY LEAVE PUBLIC SPACE THEY MIGRATE TO PRIVATE SPACES SUCH
FAILED
WE COULD FORGET
ABOUT EQUALITY
THAT WE SHOULD ONLY WORRY ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD COME
ALONG
I DO NOT THINK SO
FIRST
BECAUSE FEELING INFERIOR OR EXCLUDED
IS A VERY IMPORTANT OBSTACLE TO HAPPINESS
AND HAPPINESS IS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERS
AND SECOND BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ACHIEVE MORE EQUALITY FOR MORE THAN 2000 YEARS SINCE GREECE ROME THE JUDEO CHRISTIAN REVOLUTION
BUT
THE QUESTION IS
WHAT KIND OF EQUALITY CAN WE HAVE TODAY WITH MARKET
THAT'S MAYBE THE LEAST IMPORTANT PART IN SOME CITIES BUT BECAUSE HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE SMALLER SO WE'LL NEED MORE HOMES FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE AND THERE WILL BE MANY BUILDINGS DIFFERENT THAN
YOU'RE GOING TO FAIL TOO {LG} BECAUSE GOODNESS YOU'RE ALL
YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO DO IT IT'S TOO HARD YOU'RE AFRAID IF YOU LOOK FOR YOUR PASSION AND DON'T FIND IT YOU'LL
END OF YOUR LONG LIFE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WILL BE GATHERED IN
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE PASSION {LG}
HMM HMM OK YOU KNOW A FINE LINE BETWEEN MADNESS AND
THE WORD DESTINY DOES THE WORD DESTINY
LIKE I DID BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
AND DECIDE NOT TO DO IT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY YOU DECIDE NOT TO DO
YOU FOUND SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN I HAVE AN
IN COMPARISON TO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT INTEREST YOU AND THAT'S WHAT PASSION IS I

JANE SUSIE PENELOPE INGRID
AND SAYING TO THE WORLD I AM TOTALLY COMPLETELY COMPETENT IS DAMNING YOURSELF WITH THE FAINTEST OF PRAISE
WHO FORMULATED THE GRAND UNIFIED FIELD THEORY AND DEMONSTRATED THE
HAVE A DREAM YOU COULD HAVE SAID
SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THEN YOUR OTHER EXCUSE IS
YOU'RE AFRAID TO LOOK RIDICULOUS YOU'RE AFRAID TO TRY YOU'RE AFRAID YOU MAY FAIL
YOU KNOW WHY YOU WOULD GET ALL WARM AND FUZZY AND WRAP YOURSELF UP IN HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
LIES A DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER WHO INVENTED VELCRO
WHAT I WANT TO BE I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH MY
GREAT CAREER I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY DECIDED YOU WANT A GOOD
HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF TALENT WAS HERE LIES THE LAST
THAT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S
THEM ALL HAVE YOU NO NOT EXACTLY PASSION IS YOUR GREATEST LOVE
GREAT PARENT GREAT CAREER IS THAT NOT A PACKAGE IS THAT NOT WHO YOU ARE HOW CAN YOU BE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER
I HAD IF YOU EVER HAVE THAT THOUGHT RICOCHETING IN YOUR BRAIN IT WILL HURT A LOT
BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE INVENTED A NEW EXCUSE ANY EXCUSE TO FAIL
I WOULD PURSUE A GREAT CAREER BUT
THE GREATEST FASCINATION IN YOUR LIFE YOU HEAR IT AGAIN AND
NECESSARY TO ENUMERATE ALL OF THE WOMEN HE HAD AUDITIONED
PROPOSED TO HIS SWEETIE HE WAS AN ECONOMICALLY RATIONAL PERSON
YOU SAY THAT'S RISKY KID MIGHT FAIL
ONE WAS A GREAT CAREER ONE WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY
IN AN ALTERNATIVE LIFETIME WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE SAID IF
ESCAPE FROM MARRYING AN IRRATIONAL PERSON
THAT PEOPLE WHO PURSUE THEIR PASSIONS ARE SOMEWHAT OBSESSIVE A LITTLE
THEN THERE ARE THE HIGH WORKLOAD HIGH STRESS BLOODSUCKING SOUL DESTROYING KINDS OF JOBS AND PRACTICALLY NOTHING IN BETWEEN SO PEOPLE LOOKING FOR GOOD JOBS
TIME I SAW HIM HE WAS ON THE STAIRS CRYING {LG} WHAT A WIMP {LG} BUT
YOUR MEMORY BANKS WERE THE EVENTS OF YOUR LIFE A LINEAR PROGRESSION OF EVERYTHING FROM BIRTH UNTIL RIGHT NOW NO OF COURSE NOT WHAT YOU RECALL WERE
{NS} OK EVERYONE LET'S DO AN EXPERIMENT CLOSE YOUR EYES AND THINK OF A HAPPY MEMORY
THIS TELL US
IT'S NOT THE MOMENTS THAT DEFINE US BUT OUR CHOICES AND OUR REACTIONS THAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE
IN THOSE CHOICES RESIDES OUR BIGGEST POTENTIAL
IT'S CALLED RESPONSIBILITY
MY STORY TODAY IS STORY OF RESPONSIBILITY
THAT FEELING OF HAPPINESS DOESN'T COME FROM THE ACTUAL MOMENT BUT INSTEAD HOW WE DECIDE TO REACT TO THE MOMENT THAT'S CALLED OUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE WE DECIDE HOW TO
HERE'S WHY THE ISSUE OF ADDRESSING STUCK WITH ME I WORKED IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS FOR 10 YEARS AND WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THE MUSIC WORLD IS THAT
BUT WE HAVEN'T JUST DONE THIS IN ENGLISH WE THOUGHT IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THIS SYSTEM IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE SO FAR WE'VE BUILT IT INTO 14
FOR ME
POOR ADDRESSING WAS AN ANNOYING FRUSTRATION BUT FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE
IT'S A HUGE BUSINESS INEFFICIENCY
SEVERELY HAMPERS THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE GROWTH
AND CAN COST LIVES
WE'RE ON A MISSION TO CHANGE THAT
THREE WORDS AT A TIME

THE PREGNANT MOTHERS WHEN THEY GO INTO LABOR CAN CALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND TELL THEM EXACTLY WHERE TO PICK THEM UP FROM BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE AMBULANCES HAVE OFTEN TAKEN HOURS TO FIND THEM
BUT THIS IDEA CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN JUST GET MY MUSICIANS TO THEIR GIGS ON TIME IF THE 75 PERCENT OF COUNTRIES THAT STRUGGLE WITH RELIABLE ADDRESSING STARTED USING THREE WORD ADDRESSES THERE'S A STACK OF FAR MORE IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS
MIGHT AS WELL NOT EXIST I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HOW MY TEAM AND I ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT
CHATTED THIS THROUGH WITH FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS A MATHEMATICIAN AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS A PROBLEM WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT WE THOUGHT WELL WE COULD MAKE A NEW SYSTEM BUT IT SHOULDN'T LOOK LIKE THE OLD SYSTEM WE AGREED THAT ADDRESSES WERE BAD

I LOVE CHILDREN AND CHILDREN LOVE TO PLAY WITH ME BUT YOU SHOULD SEE THE PARENTS WHEN THEY SEE

I BELIEVE

THE LATEST ONE TO TOP THE CHART I'VE GOT THIS ONE
IT WAS A VERY BIG BANG
DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY NEAT TO BUILD A GIANT LASER DETECTOR WITH WHICH TO SEARCH FOR THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FROM THINGS LIKE COLLIDING BLACK
LISTENING TO CHANGES IN THE AMPLITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF THOSE WAVES WE CAN HEAR THE STORY THAT THOSE WAVES ARE TELLING AND AT LEAST FOR LIGO THE FREQUENCIES THAT IT CAN HEAR ARE IN THE AUDIO BAND
SO THAT'S MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AND COLLABORATOR SCOTT HUGHES A THEORETICAL PHYSICIST AT MIT WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FROM BLACK HOLES AND THE
WAVES FROM THOSE COLLIDING BLACK HOLES PASSED THROUGH THE EARTH AND THEY PASSED THROUGH YOU AND ME AND THEY PASSED THROUGH THE
ALICE TALKING THAT'S BOB INTERRUPTING SILLY BOB
FISH PLANTS DINOSAURS PEOPLE AND EVEN GOD SAVE US THE INTERNET AND
THAT THEY COULD IMPART ON OBSERVATORIES LIKE LIGO FOR THE PAST 23 YEARS
HAVE TO MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THOSE DETECTORS TO LESS THAN ONE THOUSANDTH OF THE RADIUS OF THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM AND THAT'S
AROUND EACH OTHER 100 TIMES PER SECOND BEFORE THEY COLLIDE JUST IMAGINE THE POWER OF THAT
WAVES HIT THEY STRETCHED THE AVERAGE PERSON BY ONE PART IN 10 TO THE 21 THAT'S A DECIMAL PLACE
STRETCHES SPACE AND EVERYTHING IN IT IN ONE DIRECTION AND COMPRESSES IT IN THE OTHER THIS HAS LED TO COUNTLESS INSTRUCTORS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY DOING A REALLY SILLY DANCE TO DEMONSTRATE IN THEIR CLASSES ON GENERAL
ALL OBSTACLES WILL SURELY BE OVERCOME THORNE PUBLISHED THAT IN
CALLED ADVANCED LIGO AS A RESULT IN EARLY SEPTEMBER OF 2015
THE BIG BANG ITSELF IS OBSCURED BY ITS OWN AFTERGLOW WITH GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE
REALIZED THAT THEY WERE BRILLIANT NUTS THAT THE US NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION DECIDED TO FUND
TO GRAVITY JUST IN THIS WAY CAN TELL US LOT ABOUT THE COLLISION OF TWO BLACK HOLES SOMETHING MY COLLEAGUE SCOTT HAS SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME THINKING
TWO BLACK HOLES LOCKED INTO A SPIRAL FALLING INEXORABLY TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND COLLIDED CONVERTING THREE SUNS' WORTH OF STUFF INTO PURE ENERGY IN A TENTH OF A
USEFUL WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE UNIVERSE FROM THEM THE PROBLEM IS ALL THE INTERESTING PHYSICS HAPPENS IN THE CORE AND THE CORE IS HIDDEN BEHIND THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS OF IRON AND CARBON AND SILICON WE'LL NEVER SEE THROUGH IT IT'S OPAQUE TO LIGHT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
WEAK FOR EXAMPLE THE WAVES THAT HIT US ON SEPTEMBER 14 AND YES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
LIGO WE KNOW HOW TO BUILD EXQUISITE DETECTORS THAT CAN LISTEN TO THE UNIVERSE TO THE RUSTLE AND THE CHIRP OF THE
NOW IS TO DREAM BIG DREAM WITH US THANK YOU
SINCE THEN EARTH HAS MADE AND EVOLVED
OF YOUR CELL PHONE AND THAT'S REALLY USEFUL BECAUSE IT LETS YOU MAKE AN IMAGE OR A MAP OF THE THINGS AROUND YOU BY LOOKING AT THE LIGHT COMING FROM DIFFERENT SPOTS IN THE SCENE
BUT PHYSICISTS ARE INGENIOUS AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF A BROAD LAY
LIGO FOUND THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T EXPECT HERE'S MY COLLEAGUE AND ONE OF THE KEY MEMBERS OF THE LIGO COLLABORATION MATT EVANS MY COLLEAGUE AT MIT ADDRESSING EXACTLY THAT {NS} THAT WE OBSERVED HERE ARE THE
THE LASTING IMPORTANCE OF LIGO IT'S AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY TO OBSERVE THE UNIVERSE THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE
WHAT THAT MEANS VISIBLE LIGHT HAS A WAVELENGTH A SIZE THAT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN THE THINGS AROUND YOU THE FEATURES ON PEOPLE'S
TURNED ON FOR A FINAL TEST RUN WHILE THEY SORTED OUT A FEW
ALL THAT ENERGY WAS PUMPED INTO THE FABRIC OF SPACE AND TIME
RUNNING
A 400 BED LITTLE COUNTY JAIL
THAT'S
A
WHOLE OTHER STORY BUT
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAD THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT
WAS THE ROLE OF LIFERS
IN THE DAY TO DAY LIFE INSIDE PRISONS
AND LITERALLY IN THE SOUL OF THE DEPARTMENT AND SO LET'S JUMP FORWARD FROM 2010 TO 2014 WHEN WE DID OUR FIRST TEDX EVENT
AT GRATEFORD
PROBABLY THE MALE PRISON
THAT HAS THE LARGEST LIFER POPULATION
THAT'S ENGAGED
AND PART OF THE DAY TO DAY OPERATION FROM A PROGRAMMATIC STANDPOINT
WHO LITERALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE INSIDE THE PRISON SO IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE
THAT WE'RE HERE FOR OUR SECOND EVENT
AT
A

OF INMATES
AND STAFF
AND OUR ORGANIZATION
AND SO THERE'S LITERALLY NO OTHER WAY
THAT WE COULD WRAP THIS UP
THAN TO HEAR FROM THE LADY LIFERS
WERE ALSO FRUSTRATED THAT WE COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS INSIDE THE BUILDING WE SOLVED OUR CURIOSITY IN THE OBVIOUS WAY WE WAITED UNTIL TWO IN THE MORNING WE JUMPED OVER THE FENCES WE SNUCK PAST THE SECURITY GUARDS
INTERESTED TO FIND OUT THAT 2007 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST DID NOT SHOW THAT THERE WAS ANY SORT OF DEMONSTRATED LINK BETWEEN THESE HIGHER SECURITY
HOWEVER WE UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT IN TERMS OF

HOWEVER LAST YEAR WITHOUT PUBLIC CONSULTATION THEY SOLD THEIR COMPANY TO A KUWAITI INVESTMENT FIRM FOR 1 6 BILLION POUNDS IN ONE OF THE LARGEST LAND DEALS IN UK HISTORY
FROM ROMAN LAW IT BASICALLY GIVES US THE ABILITY TO
PEOPLE WITH MONEY DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN IMAGINED FUTURE THREAT MAYBE WE CAN
THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR OURSELVES IN THE NAME OF SECURITY WE ARE BEING
PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM WAS ILLEGAL I TOLD HIM WELL NO IT IS NOT ACTUALLY ALSO I DID NOT CONSENT TO BE FILMED ON YOUR LAND EITHER HE SAID YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS HERE THIS IS PRIVATE
ON SOME ADVENTURE I DO NOT KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING BUT THIS IS WHAT WE DO WHEN WE ARE YOUNG THIS IS HOW WE MAKE SENSE OF PLACE THIS IS
IN ENGLAND FOR INSTANCE WAS ILLEGAL UNTIL 1664 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THEN THAT IT WAS TURNED FROM BEING A CRIMINAL OFFENSE INTO A CIVIL OFFENSE
WE MAKE THOSE BOUNDARIES VISIBLE AND WE ALSO GIVE OURSELVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECREATE THE CITY IN OUR IMAGE VERY
WILL MONITOR THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR IF THEY THINK THEY ARE BEING WATCHED THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE DARK SECRET OF INSTALLING CCTV ALL OVER CITIES PEOPLE WILL MONITOR THEIR OWN
CULTURE CITIES ARE MEANT TO BE PLACES OF DIVERSITY CITIES ARE MEANT TO BE PLACES OF ENCOUNTER
BY PRIVATE COMPANY CALLED MORE LONDON IT FEELS LIKE YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT IN THIS SPACE BUT AS SOON AS YOU STEP
TO BE ALONE IN THE CITY TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH MY FRIENDS AS LONG AS NOTHING IS DAMAGED OR
THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT OWNS THE TUBE I CAN PAY
WHERE WE FIND HEAVILY SURVEILLED SPACES WE DO FIND LOWER RATES OF ENGAGEMENT WITH NEIGHBORS FEWER PUBLIC GATHERINGS AND OF COURSE LESS DIVERSITY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY OF COURSE
THIS IS A FAMILIAR STORY RIGHT WE KNOW OTHER HACKERS OF VIRTUAL SPACES RATHER THAN HACKERS OF PHYSICAL SPACES WHO HAVE
WITH TAKING THE PHOTOGRAPHS IT WAS DOING WHAT I AM DOING RIGHT NOW SHARING INFORMATION THAT THEY FOUND THREATENING THESE CORPORATIONS TREATED ME A PHOTOGRAPHER OF HIDDEN SPACES IN THE SAME WAY THEY WOULD TREAT A COMPUTER HACKER
FOR CLIMBING THE HILL SEEMS LIKE AN ABSURD IDEA HOWEVER WHEN I APPLY THIS CONCEPT TO URBAN
INFORMATION ABOUT SPACES THAT WERE NOT OURS THEY EVENTUALLY CHARGED ME AND 11 OTHER PEOPLE WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMINAL DAMAGE WHICH
FROM THE 1930S TO THE 1980S I WAS STANDING THERE IN 2008 WITH MY FRIENDS TAKING PHOTOS OF THE
WOULD WANT TO DO I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT THOSE BOUNDARIES THAT ARE BEING DRAWN AROUND YOUR EXISTENCE AND THE WAY THEY ARE CHANGING YOUR BEHAVIOR I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT TRESPASSING THOSE
ACCESSING CERTAIN SPACES PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WAS UNDEMOCRATIC SO THEY STAGED DIRECT ACTION
PHONES MY CAMERAS MY COMPUTERS MY HARD DRIVES ALL OF MY RESEARCH MATERIALS
THOSE BOUNDARIES THAT ARE BEING RAISED ARE ETHICAL JUSTIFIED OR EVEN LEGAL
SUGGEST THAT IT IS NO LONGER EASIER TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS THAN PERMISSION ANYMORE PERHAPS BOTH ARE EQUALLY DIFFICULT IN TODAY'S CITY
BUILT IN MY CITY BY WHOM WITH WHAT FUNDS AND TO WHAT ENDS I THINK THOSE ARE TOTALLY REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS AS IS THE EXPECTATION THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPLORE THEIR ENVIRONMENTS WHATEVER ENVIRONMENTS THEY HAPPEN TO LIVE IN
SHAKE THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT I LEFT MY HOTEL LAST NIGHT
I WISH WE COULD END ON A GOOD NOTE HERE BUT I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A CAUTIONARY NOTE AS
ALSO FASCINATED BY HOW PLACES BECOME CLOSED TO ACCESS AND HOW AND WHY PEOPLE REAPPROPRIATE THESE PLACES
ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY LIKE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS ALLOWED OR {NS} LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO A TERM
THE WAY WE OPERATE IN THE CITY WE THINK OF THIS AS A BENEFICIAL PROCESS RIGHT WE ARE GROWING UP WE ARE CIVILIZING THOSE CHILDISH INSTINCTS WE ARE LEARNING CIVIC DUTY WHAT WE ARE ALSO DOING
AS IN THAT PRIVATE SPACE OUTSIDE THE CITY HALL THE FRUSTRATION TRANSPORT FOR LONDON WAS FEELING WAS THAT THEY IMAGINED A POTENTIAL FUTURE THREAT THAT THEY COULD NOT ARTICULATE THEY FELT THAT SOMEHOW
INTERESTED IN GOING INTO A SEWER
AND THAT IS FINE BUT WHAT I WOULD ASK OF YOU IS THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER THE DIRECT ACTION
THAT URBAN EXPLORERS AND PLACE HACKERS ARE UNDERTAKING AS THEY ACCESS THESE SECRET AND HIDDEN SPACES
A FORM OF DIRECT ACTION THAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND REASONABLE RESPONSE TO THE CLOSING DOWN OF SPACES IN OUR CITIES
SOME OF YOU ARE MAYBE THINKING NOW
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE BECAUSE IT FORCES OPEN THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE BOUNDARIES THAT ARE BEING CIRCUMSCRIBED AROUND US AND WHETHER INDEED THOSE BOUNDARIES ARE ETHICAL JUSTIFIED OR EVEN LEGAL AM NOT
THE ABILITY TO WALK ON WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY MAPPED LAND LET
AND EXPLORING IS DISCOURAGED WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE BEGIN TO FORM IN THESE
YOU WERE TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THERE FILMING TAKING PHOTOS CONGREGATING IN GROUPS OF MORE THAN THREE PICNICKING LOITERING PROTESTING ALTHOUGH NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE ILLEGAL MORE LONDON HAS A RIGHT TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE THEIR LAND IF YOU DO NOT YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED TRESPASS
I WAS TERRIFIED BY WHAT WE WERE DOING BUT I ALSO FELT THIS INCREDIBLE SENSE OF WONDER
RUNNING AROUND DOING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT DO IN MUSEUM TURNING ALL OF THE WHEELS PLAYING WITH THE LEVERS AND DIALS
IT WAS FANTASTIC WHAT FOLLOWED AFTER BATTERSEA POWER STATION WAS FIVE YEARS
OF
OPENED A HATCH CRAWLED DOWN TOOK A PHOTO IN 2012 I WAS FLYING BACK INTO LONDON AND MY PLANE WAS
A MANAGER OF SMALL THINGS AS WELL NOW IF YOU HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE ORGANIZATIONS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS
GRANDMA HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT TAPING' THE SHOW LIKE THERE IS SOME MACHINE THAT DOES THAT IN FACT YOU HAVE THE MACHINE DOWN THERE DO YOU WANT ME TO TEACH YOU HOW TO USE THE MACHINE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY AWAKE UNTIL 3 IN THE MORNING NOOOO
THERE IS A WHOLE STREAM OF THOUGHT THAT CALLS ABOUT THE META REALITY OF THINGS HOW THE THINGS THAT WE USE IN FACT SHAPE OUR BEHAVIOR AND BY SHAPING IT PREVENT US FROM DOING
SUPERIOR TO THINGS THINGS ARE JUST THINGS I HAVE A MIND I AM HUMAN BEING BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE THE
YOU YOU LOOK TIRED OOOOHH SHE SAID YEAH THIS WOMAN WHO HAD SURVIVED THE WAR AND HAD LIKE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS SHE SAYS REALLY COMPLAINING TO ME OOOHH I'M TIRED BECAUSE I HAD TO STAY AWAKE UNTIL 3
DEVISE POWER IN A CERTAIN WAY AND BY DOING SO PREVENTS ORGANIZATIONS FROM CHANGING THE
THE OLD YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CARS THAT WAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT YOUR CARS THAT YOUR CHANGE EFFORTS ARE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT IN THE ORGANIZATION BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
MOST MANAGERS ARE SO EXCITED SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE NEW
WE LIKE THE NEW SO MUCH
AND SOMETIMES WE DESPISE THE OLD THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE OLD STILL HAS ROOTS
AND THE ROOTS ARE VERY DEEP MUCH DEEPER
THINK I DO YEAH
UM CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS
WELL IT'S MANY COMPUTERS CONNECTED
GRANDMA
OOOOHH AND IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU CAN DO THINGS ON THE INTERNET
YEAH GRANDMA THAT'S THE IDEA OF CLIENT SERVER OOOOHH
FINE GRANDMA NOW A FEW YEARS LATER THE SAME GRANDMA OLDER OF COURSE CALLS ME AND SAYS
WELL IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BIG
IT CAN BE A SMALL ORGANIZATION IT CAN BE A CLUB IT
CAN BE GROUP OF FRIENDS
HAVE YOU SEEN HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS HOW TOUGH
WELL
MY JOB TODAY
IN ABOUT 12 MINUTES OR LESS IS TO TEACH YOU HOW TO CHANGE AN ORGANIZATION
OR RATHER
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT CHANGE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT I THINK IT'S VERY FITTING FOR A BUSINESS SCHOOL TO TEACH PEOPLE WHY ORGANIZATIONS DON'T CHANGE SO TODAY I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT MANAGING
OF COURSE IS A METAPHOR NOW YOU UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL FORGETTING IS DEALING WITH THE METAPHOR ORGANIZATIONS DON'T FORGET BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK BUT MANAGERS DO THINK AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT
DO NOT CHANGE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE WELL I WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT EXPLANATION I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT WE'RE REALLY WILLING TO CHANGE AND IF THE CONTEXT CHANGES WE DON'T
SOMETHING IS NOT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN OUR ORGANIZATION WHAT IS DIFFICULT IS TO KEEP DOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
DOING SOMETHING NEW FINDING NEW IDEA IS NOT REALLY TOUGH WHAT IS TOUGH IS TO GET THE IDEA TO STICK IN THE ORGANIZATION ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS IDEA IS NEW AND RADICAL WELL I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T
YOU CAN FIGHT WITH LEFT AND YOU CAN FIGHT WITH RIGHT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THE PILLOW STAYS THE SAME AND YOU'RE EXHAUSTED THIS IS A HAPPY PILLOW HE'S
I THINK THIS PERSONA THE ONE THAT YOU'RE SEEING ON STAGE RIGHT NOW STARTED TAKING SHAPE WHEN I WAS JUST A LITTLE KID AS LONG AS
TO WORK WHAT I WAS BEING TAUGHT WAS THAT GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE AND REGULAR PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE POWER TO TELL THE GOVERNMENT WHAT TO DO
MUSCLES AND HIGHLIGHT REAL ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITY
BECAUSE WHAT I'VE STARTED LEARNING WITH THE STUFF THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS IF YOU WORK REALLY HARD TO CREATE SOMETHING INTERESTING AND UNIQUE
PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION
AND WHEN ENOUGH PEOPLE BEGIN TO PAY ATTENTION TO AN ISSUE
ELECTED OFFICIALS PAY ATTENTION
AND WHEN THAT BEGINS TO HAPPEN
CHANGE CAN HAPPEN I
WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE
THIS IS MY LITTLE BROTHER
WE ALL HEAR ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY TODAY IS SO ADVANCED AND JUST ABOUT ANYBODY CAN MAKE A FILM AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A CELL PHONE AND A MODEST COMPUTER
IS THAT THE FILM RAISED AWARENESS AND CAUSED CHANGE AND IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT MY SECOND IDENTITY WAS BORN ZACHARY MAXWELL
THE LIGHT AGGHH GO AWAY FROM THE LIGHT AGGH {LG} {NS} BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED THE VIDEO DREW A LOT OF ATTENTION THE CITY COUNCIL GOT INVOLVED AND THE DEP OF TRANSPORTATION RESPONDED THE COMMISSIONER INVITED LUCAS TO A
AND WITH THAT I GUESS I'M GOING TO HEAD BACK HOME NOW AND RESUME MY OTHER LIFE AS A SHY AND AWKWARD NINTH GRADER
NAME NAMES SHINE THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE ISSUE AND THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE AND I PROMISE YOU THEY WILL PAY ATTENTION
BECAUSE THE FACT IS WE'RE NO LONGER LIVING IN THE SIMPLE DAYS OF JUST SITTING BACK AND HOPING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO WORK FOR US YOU NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
SO EVEN IF YOU'RE SHY AND QUIET LIKE ME FIND THAT OTHER SIDE OF YOU
BE BOLD
BE CREATIVE
BE FEARLESS
CHANNEL YOUR INNER BADASS AND MAKE CHANGE
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO THIS TOO
EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST A KID YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN YOUR COMMUNITY THINK ABOUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HOMETOWN RIGHT NOW THAT'S ALWAYS BOTHERED YOU
DO THE CARS DRIVE TOO FAST IS THERE TOO MUCH
WRITING LETTERS SENDING EMAILS AND MAKING SHORT VIDEO MESSAGES TO THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE AND I DID THIS FOR MONTHS BUT NOBODY WOULD RESPOND TO ME THEY ALL THOUGHT I WAS SOME CRAZY SIXTH GRADER AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE RIGHT AND I KEPT
FOR EXAMPLE I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROBLEM THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE SOMETIMES IN NEW YORK CITY WE GET VERY BRUTAL
I'M REALLY NERVOUS RIGHT NOW
BUT LET ME EXPLAIN BY TELLING YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF AND MY STORY
I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF AS HAVING TWO DIFFERENT IDENTITIES THE FIRST AND MORE NATURAL IDENTITY IS A
I MAKE FILMS BUT MAYBE THAT'S NOT YOUR THING YOU CAN WRITE A POEM COMPOSE A SONG TAKE SOME PICTURES PAINT YOUR CANVAS IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF JUST THAT YOU DO IT WITH PASSION AND THAT IT'S IN YOUR OWN UNIQUE VOICE IN A WAY THAT ONLY YOU CAN SAY IT
AND ONCE YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR MASTERPIECE SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD POST IT ONLINE GENERATE BUZZ THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA SEND IT TO YOUR TV STATION OR THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER
I REALLY LIKE OUR PRINCIPAL BUT SHE RUNS A PRETTY TIGHT SHIP AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING TO APPROVE NEEDLESS TO SAY I COULD GET IN
HELPED ME GET MEETINGS WITH OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF BOTH CITY SANITATION AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
SOMETHING THAT WAS BOTHERING ME WAS THE LUNCH BEING SERVED AT MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I ASKED MY PARENTS IF I COULD PACK MY OWN LUNCH BUT THEY WANTED
AND NETWORK YOU TO THE UNIVERSE AND OTHER DEVICES OUT
ME TO WALK UNTIL NOW {NS} THANK YOU
AND WALKING AGAIN WE AT BERKELEY
ROBBED EVERY OUNCE OF HOPE FROM MY BEING ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY HAS SINCE ENABLED
ALL SENSATION AND MOVEMENT BELOW MY
OF RAIN I'VE ADDED THE SOUND OF BACON FRYING SO I WANT YOU THINK CAREFULLY WHICH ONE THE CLIP WITH THE BACON IS
VEGETABLE SECTION
BUT IT'S OFTEN A LOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT SO LET'S REVERSE ENGINEER TOGETHER THE CREATION OF A SOUND EFFECT
ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES COMES FROM FRANK SERAFINE HE'S A CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR LIBRARY AND A GREAT SOUND DESIGNER FOR TRON AND STAR TREK AND OTHERS
HE WAS PART OF THE PARAMOUNT TEAM THAT WON THE OSCAR FOR BEST SOUND FOR THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER IN THIS COLD WAR CLASSIC
IN THE
FROM ITS SOURCE SEPARATING CAUSE AND EFFECT SORT
THAT'S NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE ON SCREEN ACTION
ALSO EMOTIONALLY INTIMATE MOMENTS
IN CINEMA ARE OFTEN HEARD WITH ZERO REVERB BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WOULD SOUND IF SOMEONE WAS SPEAKING INSIDE OUR EAR
ON THE COMPLETELY OTHER SIDE
ADDING A LOT OF REVERB TO A VOICE IS GOING TO MAKE US THINK THAT WE'RE
BETWEEN THE LISTENER AND THE ORIGINAL SOUND SOURCE
THAT DISSONANT SOUNDS FOR EXAMPLE BRASS OR WIND INSTRUMENTS PLAYED VERY LOUD
MAY REMIND US
OF ANIMAL HOWLS IN NATURE AND THEREFORE CREATE A SENSE OF IRRITATION OR FEAR
SO NOW WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT ON SCREEN SOUNDS BUT OCCASIONALLY THE SOURCE OF A SOUND CANNOT BE SEEN THAT'S WHAT WE CALL OFFSCREEN SOUNDS OR ACOUSMATIC
ACOUSMATIC SOUNDS
WELL THE TERM ACOUSMATIC COMES
BREAKING CELERY OR FROZEN LETTUCE
AMBIENCES ARE THE UNIQUE BACKGROUND SOUNDS THAT ARE
IS THAT SOUND IS A LANGUAGE
IT CAN TRICK US BY TRANSPORTING US GEOGRAPHICALLY
IT CAN CHANGE THE MOOD IT
CAN SET THE PACE
IT CAN MAKE US LAUGH OR IT
CAN MAKE US SCARED
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL I FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT LANGUAGE FEW YEARS AGO
AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MAKE IT INTO SOME SORT OF PROFESSION
AND I THINK WITH OUR WORK THROUGH THE SOUND LIBRARY WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF
EXPAND THE VOCABULARY OF THAT LANGUAGE
AND IN THAT WAY WE WANT TO OFFER THE RIGHT TOOLS TO SOUND DESIGNERS FILMMAKERS AND VIDEO GAME AND APP DESIGNERS
TO KEEP TELLING EVEN BETTER STORIES
AND CREATING EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL LIES SO THANKS FOR LISTENING
THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY MOMENT OF SILENCE IF YOU LISTEN AROUND YOU THERE'S ALWAYS SOME SORT OF NOISE
IT'S USED IN EACH FILM SILENCE CAN PLACE US INSIDE THE HEAD OF A CHARACTER OR PROVOKE THOUGHT WE OFTEN RELATE SILENCES WITH CONTEMPLATION
SOUND EFFECTS CAN TAP INTO OUR EMOTIONAL
ONCE YOU'VE CREATED YOUR SOUNDS AND YOU'VE SYNCED THEM TO THE IMAGE
YOU WANT THOSE SOUNDS TO LIVE IN THE WORLD OF THE STORY
AND ONE THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO ADD REVERB
SO THIS IS THE FIRST AUDIO TOOL I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
REVERBERATION OR REVERB IS THE
PERSISTENCE OF THE SOUND AFTER THE ORIGINAL SOUND HAS ENDED SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE
THE ALL THE REFLECTIONS FROM THE MATERIALS THE OBJECTS AND THE WALLS AROUND THE
ASKED TO PRODUCE THE SOUND OF THE PROPELLER OF THE SUBMARINE SO THEY HAD A SMALL PROBLEM THEY COULDN'T REALLY FIND A SUBMARINE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD SO BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID IS
SENSE OF UBIQUITY OR PANOPTICISM
AND THEREFORE AUTHORITY
THERE'S A STRONG TRADITION OF ACOUSMATIC SOUND
NUNS IN MONASTERIES
IN ROME AND VENICE USED TO SING
IN ROOMS UP IN GALLERIES
CLOSE TO THE CEILING CREATING THE ILLUSION THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO ANGELS UP IN THE SKY
START BY DOING AN EXPERIMENT I'M GOING TO PLAY THREE VIDEOS OF A RAINY DAY BUT I'VE REPLACED THE AUDIO OF ONE OF
BEING DEEP IN THOUGHT BUT APART FROM HAVING ONE MEANING SILENCE BECOMES A
WATCHING A MOVIE
AND PHONE RINGS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY RINGING
IT'S BEEN ADDED LATER IN POSTPRODUCTION IN A STUDIO ALL OF THE SOUNDS YOU HEAR ARE FAKE EVERYTHING APART FROM THE DIALOGUE IS
THE SOUND OF THUNDER MAY INDICATE DIVINE INTERVENTION OR ANGER
CHURCH BELLS
CAN REMIND US OF THE PASSING OF TIME OR
BIRDS CHIRPING OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW MAY INDICATE NORMALITY PERHAPS BECAUSE AS A SPECIES WE'VE BEEN USED TO THAT SOUND EVERY MORNING FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS
OCCASIONALLY THEY CAN BE SO SIGNIFICANT
OR LIKE IT WAS RECORDED INSIDE A CHAPEL OR CHURCH
ARE CONDITIONED TO EMBRACE THE LIES WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ACCURACY SO ON THE SUBJECT OF DECEPTION I WANTED TO QUOTE ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS IN THE DECAY
FOR A LIVING I AM NOT GOING TO REVEAL MY AGE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I AM MUCH
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT DAY WAS THAT I WAS SICK WHAT MY CO HOST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS I WAS HAVING A STROKE OR MORE ACCURATELY A SERIES OF STROKES I
JUST BECAUSE IT'S SOMEONE'S BIRTHDAY OR JUST BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS
MY LIFE EVERYBODY KEPT SAYING BRO BRO IT'S BUCKET LIST TIME AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS I'VE
ME AND SLOWLY OVER TIME I GOT BETTER KIND OF LIKE A MORE MELANCHOLY VERSION OF THE
MOLESKINE NOTEBOOKS THAT I BOUGHT LAST YEAR {LG} WHICH I HAVE YET TO REALLY WRITE ANYTHING
THE FIRST THING MAN I HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY I HAD A STROKE FACEBOOK F CK IT
F CK IT {LG} YES IT LOOKS LIKE RAIN TODAY WE LIVE IN VANCOUVER IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M WRITING THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF A BUCKET LIST I'M WRITING A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS I DIDN'T NEED IN MY LIFE ANYMORE THAT'S KIND OF WHEN A LIGHT WENT OFF IN MY HEAD
IN OUR UNDERWEAR LET'S GO SWIM WITH THE SHARKS IN THE BARRIER
WE HAVE SOME HISTORY TOGETHER YOUR NAME IS SO PROMISING BUT THE
A MONTH I HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY I CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO THE BEACH NEXT SUMMER AND START SHOWING
DO ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO NOTHING ZERO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME SO
A PERSISTENT NUMBNESS ON MY LEFT SIDE AS WE LEARNED
BOY I'M KIND OF STARTING TO SOUND LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A DICK
{NS} MY NAME IS SCOTT JONES I AM A TV HOST AND A WRITER I AM ORIGINALLY FROM NEW YORK CITY I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN VANCOUVER BRITISH COLUMBIA FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS
THAT NO ONE EXCEPT MY CATS AND JEANINE YOU TOO HUH EVER
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BUCKET LISTS IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME IT
START DOING THAT EVERY DAY IN FACT YOU KNOW
THAT I AM ALMOST NEVER WRONG {LG}
TO START COURTING A MORE SOPHISTICATED CLASS OF WOMAN WHO DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME IN A CLOSET ON A
YOU ARE READY TO LET GO OF RIGHT NOW THINK OF IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS IT CAN BE A BUTTON IT CAN BE A SNOW GLOBE
I'M GOING TO END THINGS THE MOMENT I KNOW AND JEANINE BABY
I'VE GOT A DEBIT CARD I'VE GOT TO PUNCH ALL THESE NUMBERS IN DO I OR DON'T I I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS
INSTALLED IN MY CHEST A ROBOTIC VALVE AND I
DO SOMETHING THAT I LOVE I WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO I LOVE I'M VERY FORTUNATE FOR THOSE TWO THINGS
OF SHOWS IN A NIGHT LET SOME THINGS GO AND YOUR LIFE I PROMISE YOU WILL BE EXPONENTIALLY BETTER THANK YOU VERY
ONE WOULD BE HURT IF IT FELL
TO TURN IT GO UP AND GO DOWN WE HAVE A SPLIT WING WITH THE SPLIT WING WE GET THE LIFT AT THE UPPER WING AND WE GET THE PROPULSION AT THE LOWER
ONE METER AND SIX AND THE WEIGHT IS ONLY 450 GRAMS
IF YOU CONTROL AND REGULATE IT YOU WILL GET THAT AERODYNAMIC
THEREFORE IT RISES UP FROM PASSIVE TORSION TO ACTIVE TORSION FROM 30 PERCENT UP TO 80
BY FLAPPING THEIR WINGS SO WE LOOKED AT THE
YOUR HATS ON SO MAYBE WE'LL TRY IT ONCE TO FLY A SMARTBIRD THANK YOU
SO I NOW WOULD LIKE YOU TO PUT YOUR SEAT BELTS
I HAD TO MOVE THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS AWAY TO FOLLOW A DREAM A DREAM I HAVE HAD EVER SINCE I WAS A
A MASSIVE BUILDING BOOM AS WELL THIS IS THE REALITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF AFRICA AND HERE'S
MORE EXAMPLES WILL NOT BE ENOUGH WE NEED A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF AFRICAN ARCHITECTS AND DESIGNERS TO LEAD WITH THOUSANDS MORE
AND CONSTRUCTION SIMILAR TO WHAT I WITNESSED IN CHINA OR CAN WE
HOUSING UNITS EACH DAY EVERY DAY
SOLUTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES BUT THESE THREE EXAMPLES ARE NOT ENOUGH
WAS AND STILL IS EXPERIENCING ITS OWN POPULATION AND ECONOMIC
I'M OPTIMISTIC WE CAN I KNOW AFRICANS WHO ARE ALREADY DOING
HAS TO CHANGE IF WE ARE TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS UNIQUE TO US RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING TO TURN KIGALI INTO BEIJING LAGOS INTO SHENZHEN
TOGETHER TO BUILD CHILDREN BRING STONES FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF GREAT INGENUITY AND THE WILL TO SURVIVE
BIRTH AT HOME OR SHE HAS TO WALK A REALLY LONG JOURNEY TO THE NEAREST CLINIC AND ONE OUT OF 36 OF THESE MOTHERS DIES DURING CHILDBIRTH
IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANKIND WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT BY
WHEN WE ASKED THE FELLOWS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AFTER THEIR AFRICAN DESIGN CENTRE
AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH WE HAVE TO BUILD THEIR DESIGN CONFIDENCE AND EMPOWER THEM TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT ARE TRULY AFRICAN BUT GLOBALLY INSPIRING THANK YOU VERY MUCH
POPULATION WILL BE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THE
FUTURE CITIES BUT NOT AS VAST SLUMS BUT THE MOST RESILIENT AND THE MOST SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE PLACES ON EARTH
JOURNEY THAT I HAVE EVER TAKEN THAT WAS IN
R AND HIS TEAM HAVE THEY'RE LEARNING TO UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH IMPACT OF BETTER BUILDINGS AS WE AT MASS DESIGN GROUP HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL
TO BE INSPIRED BY THIS FELLOW'S BELIEF THAT GREAT ARCHITECTURE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON HOW THE FUTURE OF AFRICA IS BUILT
SCHOOLS THAT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY SIMILAR TO EVERY PROJECT IN THE VILLAGES OF THIS
PEOPLE HOW TO BUILD USING LOCAL MATERIALS FROM HIS COUNTRY
INTERRUPTED HIS ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION AT THE TIME HE WAS APPLYING TO JOIN THE AFRICAN DESIGN CENTRE
AND THIS FAST PACED DEVELOPMENT ALSO CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE POLLUTION THAT IS HAUNTING CHINA
WORKED IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN AFRICA FOCUSING ON THIS MORE EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE MODEL OF ARCHITECTURAL
IS ACHIEVABLE AND WE HAVE THE TALENT TO MAKE IT A REALITY BUT THE JOURNEY TO READY THAT TALENT FOR THE TASK AHEAD LIKE MY OWN JOURNEY IS FAR TOO
TO TAKE THIS MOVEMENT ACROSS AFRICA EVENTUALLY THE WHOLE WORLD
A COMMUNITY THAT WILL BUILD THE DESIGN CONFIDENCE OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF AFRICAN ARCHITECTS AND DESIGNERS
THE SAME SOIL OF THIS SITE THIS REDUCES THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THIS BUILDING
TO BUILD SEVEN HEALTH CENTERS 25 SCHOOLS AND
SCHOOLS OF ARCHITECTURE SO WHEN I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY IN CHINA I LEFT MY LIFE AND MY FAMILY BEHIND AND I MOVED TO
HEAR GUNSHOTS GOING OFF IN THE BACKGROUND OF HIS INTERVIEW CALL BUT EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CIVIL
THE MOON WE MAKE PHONES THAT TALK TO US OR CUSTOMIZE RADIO STATIONS
OUR MOST ADVANCED SOFTWARE IS STILL STRUGGLING AT UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING THIS ENORMOUS CONTENT
SO IN OTHER WORDS
COLLECTIVELY AS A SOCIETY
WE'RE VERY MUCH BLIND
PICTURES AS WELL AS NATURAL LANGUAGE SENTENCES GENERATED BY HUMANS
FIRST STEP TOWARDS THIS GOAL IS TO TEACH A COMPUTER TO SEE OBJECTS THE BUILDING BLOCK OF THE VISUAL WORLD
PART OF THE GENERAL FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SO ULTIMATELY
A MINUTE IS THAT IT
HAS THE COMPUTER ALREADY MATCHED OR EVEN SURPASSED HUMAN CAPABILITIES
NOT SO FAST
SO FAR WE HAVE JUST TAUGHT THE COMPUTER TO SEE OBJECTS
THIS IS LIKE A SMALL CHILD LEARNING TO UTTER A FEW NOUNS
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT IT'S ONLY THE FIRST STEP
SOON ANOTHER DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONE WILL BE HIT AND CHILDREN BEGIN TO COMMUNICATE IN SENTENCES
WE HAVE PROTOTYPED CARS THAT CAN DRIVE BY THEMSELVES BUT WITHOUT SMART VISION THEY CANNOT REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRUMPLED PAPER BAG ON THE ROAD WHICH CAN BE RUN OVER AND A ROCK THAT SIZE
SHOWING THE COMPUTERS SOME TRAINING IMAGES OF A PARTICULAR OBJECT LET'S
WAS TO GIVE THE ALGORITHMS THE KIND OF TRAINING DATA THAT A CHILD WAS GIVEN THROUGH EXPERIENCES
IN BOTH QUANTITY AND QUALITY
ONCE WE KNOW THIS WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO COLLECT A DATA SET THAT HAS FAR MORE IMAGES THAN WE HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE
AND TOGETHER WITH PROFESSOR KAI LI AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY WE LAUNCHED THE IMAGENET PROJECT IN 2007
LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOUNT A CAMERA ON OUR HEAD AND WAIT FOR MANY YEARS WE WENT TO THE INTERNET
THE BIGGEST TREASURE TROVE OF PICTURES THAT HUMANS HAVE EVER CREATED
WE DOWNLOADED NEARLY A BILLION IMAGES AND USED CROWDSOURCING TECHNOLOGY LIKE THE AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK PLATFORM TO HELP US TO LABEL THESE IMAGES
IS MY SON LEO ON MY QUEST FOR VISUAL INTELLIGENCE I THINK OF LEO CONSTANTLY AND THE FUTURE WORLD HE WILL LIVE IN
SOLELY ON BETTER AND BETTER ALGORITHMS
AGE THREE A CHILD WOULD HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PICTURES OF THE REAL WORLD
THE TED FASHION WE OPENED UP THE ENTIRE DATA SET TO THE WORLDWIDE RESEARCH COMMUNITY FOR FREE
WE REALLY MEAN UNDERSTANDING IN FACT
PICTURES IS NOT THE SAME AS TO SEE
CHALLENGE IS TO GO FROM THREE TO 13 AND FAR BEYOND LET ME REMIND YOU WITH THIS PICTURE OF THE BOY AND THE CAKE AGAIN
IS MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN EVER WE
CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR LEO AND FOR THE WORLD
OF TRAINING EXAMPLES SO INSTEAD OF
HERE TODAY TO GIVE YOU A PROGRESS REPORT ON THE LATEST ADVANCES IN OUR RESEARCH IN COMPUTER VISION ONE OF THE MOST FRONTIER AND POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
THAT'S AN ENORMOUS MODEL
POWERED BY THE MASSIVE DATA FROM IMAGENET AND THE MODERN CPUS AND GPUS TO TRAIN SUCH A HUMONGOUS MODEL
THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK BLOSSOMED IN A WAY THAT NO ONE EXPECTED
IT BECAME THE
TO THE MACHINES FIRST WE TEACH THEM TO SEE THEN THEY HELP US TO SEE BETTER
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE DATA TO NOURISH OUR COMPUTER BRAIN WE'RE READY TO COME BACK TO THE ALGORITHMS THEMSELVES AS IT TURNED OUT
15 YEARS NOW STARTING FROM MY PH D AT CALTECH AND THEN LEADING STANFORD'S VISION
OUR MOST ADVANCED MACHINES AND COMPUTERS STILL STRUGGLE AT THIS TASK
I NOTICED THAT MY PARENTS WOULD TREAR MY BROTHER VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN HOW THEY WOULD TREAT ME
THEY WOULD NOT BE SO CONCERNED WHEN HE WOULD TAKE THE BUS ALONE AND
THEY WEREN'T AS PROTECTIVE OF HIM AS THEY WERE OF ME NOT NEARLY PROTECTIVE
AND
IT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD IT FELT REALLY UNFAIR ACTUALLY DARING TWO X CHROMOSOMES FROM THE LOTTERY LEFT ME FAR FROM WINNING I FELT LIKE I HAD TO BE AFRAID
I FELT LIKE I HAD TO KEEP MY GUARD UP AT ALL TIMES AND I WASN'T FAIR
AT A YOUNG AGE I WAS EXPOSED TO GENDER INEQUALITY AND I DIDN'T LIKE THE WEIGHT OF ENVIDENCE SO I WOULD TRY TO THEORIZE WAYS FOR
YOU KNOW WHY MAYBE THAT WAS THE CASE AND I DIDN'T IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME YET THAT LIFE IS UNFAIR AND SO I WOULD THINK
MAYBE JUST MAYBE IN A CYNDI LAUPER ESCALADE MAYBE GIRLS JUST HAVE MORE FUN AT THE END OF IT ALL AND SO MAYBE IT'LL JUST END OF ADDING UP AND SO IT'LL END UP BEING PRETTY EQUAL BUT
I
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE THAT GIRLS HAVE MORE FUN AND EVEN IF IT IS
IT DOESN'T QUITE RECONCILE THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR
AND SO I WONDER IS THIS FEAR THAT WE EXPERIENCED IS IT VALID WELL LET'S SEE
I ASKED HIM I SAID I AM WORKING ON THIS PROJECT WILL YOU BE MY STRANGER OF THE DAY
BEFORE EVEN EXPLAINING WHAT IT WAS HE SAID YES THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S THAT UNTIL YOU SURE THAT YOU WANT TO MEET STRANGERS ISN'T IT HE SAID YES I APOLOGIZED AND SAID I KNOW YOU ARE WORKING BUT
ANYWAYS HE AGREED TO IT AND SO IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY ACTUALLY EVERY TIME HE WOULD WALK PASS HER TABLE AND IMMIDIATELY HE WOULD DROP A FIVE SECOND FACT ABOUT HIMSELF AND
THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT HE HOSTS MEDITATION SESSION IN HIS HOUSE
THE SECOND TIME HE CAME AROUND HE SAID THAT HE USED TO WORK IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THAT HE USED TO STUDY BUSSINESS AND AT THE END OF IT ALL I ASKED HIMSELF IF IT COULD GO AND MAYBE JOIN ONE OF HIS MEDITATION SESSION SOMETIME AND HE SAID SURE AND I DID AND IT WAS AMAZING
JUST COMING BACK FROM WORK AND I WAS WORKING PRETTY BRISKLY
I WAS AFRAID THAT IT'D HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND SHAMARI WAS SITTING ON HIS BIKE LOOKING BACK TOWARDS ME
AND
HE LOOKED KIND OF CURIOUS AND AS I WALKED PAST KIND OF SHOUTED OUT AT ME AND I FELT KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE BUT WE WERE IN A PARK AND IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND I THOUGHT WHAT IS THESE REALLY TO LOSE IF I ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION AND SO HE KIND OF FOLLOWED ME ON HIS BIKE AND I WAS
TALKING TO HIM WE WERE JUST HAVING A CONVSERSATION AND
USUALLY I WOULD HAVE BOOKED IT BUT I DECIDED YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE I REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE SO WE GOT TO TALKING AND AT ONE POINT IN OUR CONVERSATION HE ACTUALLY FELL HALFWAY OFF OF HIS BIKE AND I WAS LIKE ARE YOU OKAY AND HE SAID I GOT LOST IN YOUR EYESSORRY AND AT THIS POINT I
WAS JUST FEELING REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT NOW
FAST TRACK TO THE END OF OUR COVERSATION
HE HAD MENTIONED THINGS ABOUT DO YOU THINK THAT WOMEN IN VANCOUVER STUCK UP DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THIS AND AT THE END OF OUR CONVERSATION
WE GOT TO TALKING ABOUT
HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT I TOLD HIM THAT I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THAT HE WAS TALKING TO ME
AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN HE SAID YOU KNOW HOW CAN I APPROACH PEOPLE WITH MORE RESPECT
I DON'T LIKE THAT I MADE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND SO IT TURNED INTO THIS
ME HE USED TO RELATE HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS WIFE USED TO COMPARE IT TO THE RELATIONSHIPS OF HIS FRIENDS AND THEIR PARTNERS
AND HE FOUND THAT IN THIS PROCESS OF COMPARING HIMSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE HE WASN'T REALLY GETTING ANYWHERE IT WASN'T VERY PRODUCTIVE
DIDN'T MAKE HIM HAPPIER AND HIS BIGGEST LEARNING FROM IT WAS THAT HE REALIZED IT WAS ACTUALLY AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY TO COMPARE SOMETHING SO QUALITATIVE TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO QUITE QUALITATIVE IS REALLY NOT
A PRODUCTIVE EXERCISE THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM IT
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHY IT IS THAT MAYBE WE DON'T APPROACH STRANGERS AS MUCH IN OUR EVERYDAY AND
I THINK
PART OF IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH WE COMPARE OURSELVES TO OTHER PEOPLE AND HOW WE KEEP OURSELVES IN THESE BOXES
AND EVEN ON FACEBOOK WHEN YOU SEE A PROFILE PICTURE AND HOW MANY LIKES IT HAS IT IS KIND OF AWAY OF QUANTIFYING
THIS VALUE THAT WE HAVE IS PEOPLE IN IT COMPARES IT IN THAT WAY IN A WAY THAT TRIES TO QUANTIFY IT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING
MUCH MORE THAN JUST A JANITOR SHE ME ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD AND HOW SHE GREW UP IN THE PHILIPPINES AND SHE LIVED IN THE VILLAGE THAT DIDN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY AT THE TIME
AND
THE CLOSEST GROCERY STORE WAS HOURS AWAY SO EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS SHE'D GO WITH HER SIBLING
SHE WOULD CARRY FOOD ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD TO COME HOME
AND THIS WAS SUCH AN INTERESTING STORY THAT SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS REALLY GRATEFUL FOR WHAT SHE DOES HAVE NOW
REFLECTING ON THAT STORY AND I FELT REALLY INSPIRED FROM THIS AND WITHOUT HAVING SPOKEN TO HER I WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN THIS
THAT BEING A WOMAN MADE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY COULD TRUST ME MORE
AND
THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A WEIRD CLAIM BUT THERE
IS SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S WORKING ON A SIMILAR PROJECT HERE IN VANCOUVER ACTUALLY CALLED THEM THE STRANGER PROJECT WHICH I FOUND OUT ABOUT AFTERWARDS AND
WHAT'S NEEDED IS THAT
FOR HIS PROJECT HE APPROACHES PEOPLE AND
HE DOCUMENTS THEM ONLINE AS WELL
AND HE LISTS HOW
MANY TIMES IT TAKES HIM BEFORE HE
GETS TO TALK TO A STRANGER WHO AGREES TO SPEAK WITH THEM AS WELL
AND SOMETIMES IT IS 5 OR 6 OR 7 PEOPLE THAT HE HAS TO TALK TO BEFOREHAND
FOR ME
THERE WAS ONLY LIKE ONE AND A HALF TIMES WHERE I GOT KIND OF REJECTION FROM STRANGER BUT FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS WILLING TO SPEAK WITH ME
AND SO I DREW CONNECTION WITH THIS BACK TO
ON DAY 101
I MET A WOMAN NAMED LYNN SHE WAS WALKING PAST ME IN THE PARK
AND I STOPPED AND I ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE A MOMENT TO TALK AND SHE SAID SHE TOOK A STEP BACK TO TOOK A LOOK AT ME AND SHE SAID I GUESS I HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO TALK
HALF AN HOUR LATER WE WERE STILL TALKING
AND SHE WAS SHARING WITH ME A STORY FROM TIME 30 YEARS AGO WHEN A STRANGER HAD TREATED HER WITH UTMOST KINDNESS A COMPLETE STRANGER AND SHE WAS REFLECTING ON THIS MOMENT IN HER LIFE AND SHE WAS MOVED TO TEARS OF JOY
SHE WAS MOVED TO TEARS THINKING ABOUT THIS KINDNESS FROM A STRANGER
SHE WAS SO VULNERABLE AND OPEN AND COMPLETELY WHOLEHEARTEDLY TRUSTING ME WITH THIS STORY AND SO AT THE END OF IT ALL
THEY PROBABLY ARE SOME KHARAB UNCLE OUT THERE WHEN WE WERE WALKING ON THE STREET BUT I GUARANTEE YOU THAT NOT EVERYONE IS ONE
AND
IF WE CAN FEEL MORE CONNECTED IN OUR SPACES THEN WE WILL FEEL SAFER WE'LL FEEL HAPPIER
WE WILL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND MORE CONNECTED LESS ISOLATED
AND I FEEL LIKE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE
BY EVEN JUST SPREADING A SMILE OR A SIMPLE HELLO
AND I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE
THANK YOU
TALKING ABOUT WITH MY BROTHER
AND HOW
THIS FEAR THAT'S INSTILLED IN OUR CULTURE
IT LEAVES
WOMEN FEELING AFRAID
AND IT LEAVES MEN FEELING AS THOUGH THEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF TRUST
NOW THESE ARE BIG CLAIMS AND THIS IS JUST GENERALLY
HEART SO NOW I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME MORE OF THESE STORIES BUT I AM GOING TO RELATE THEM BACK TO SOME OF THE KEY REFLECTIONS THAT I'VE DRAWN FROM WORKING ON THIS PROJECT
SO KAREN IS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO I EXCHANGE CONTACT INFORMATION WITH AND
AN AMAZING WOMEN SHE IS A PROFESSIONAL CHEF SO LUCKY ME I GOT TO GO TO HER YALETOWN APARTMENT AND SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO BAKE SCONES SO WE BAKED SCONES TOGETHER AND ATE LUNCH AND I LEARNED ABOUT HER STORY IN HER LIFE AND THIS
WHENEVER I WOULD START CRYING READING RATE SHOULDN'T EXCEED 21 CHARACTERS SEC LENGTHEN DURATION REDUCE TEXT SPLIT THE SUBTITLE WHEN I WAS A KID MY PARENTS WOULD SAY STOP CRYING OR ELSE KHARAAB UNCLE IS GONNA COME TO GET YOU
KHARAAB UNCLE IS COMING TO GET YOU
KHARAAB
MEANS BAD IN KACHHI WHICH IS AN INDIAN DIALECT
KHARAAB UNCLE MEANS BAD GUY
LOOKING BACK ON THIS
I ALWAYS LAUGH BECAUSE
I JUST THINK ABOUT HOW FUNNY IT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A BAD GUY MY PARENTS CALLED HIM AN UNCLE BECAUSE DISCLAIMER TO BROWN PARENTS EVERY SINGLE ADULT IS EITHER AN UNCLE OR AN AUNT TO YOU
SO I SHOULD'T REALLY HAVE THEM SUPPRISED
ANYWAYS
I HAVE A VERY DISTINCT MEMORY FROM MY CHILDHOOD OF WHEN I WAS SITTING ON THE OLD CARPET IN OUR
TOWN HOME IN BURNABY AND I WAS SITTING ON TOP OF THE WARM HEATER VENT AND PEERING OUTSIDE LOOKING ONTO THE STREET
AND MY TEARY EYES WERE FUTHER BLURRED BY THE RAINDROP ON THE WINDOW
AND I REMEMBER QUITE VIVIDLY SEEING A CAR PULL UP INTO OUR DRIVEWAY IT WAS A WHITE CAR AND REMEMBER MY HEART STARTED TO RACE AND I THOUGHT OH NO KHARAAB UNCLE IS REALLY COMING
TO GET ME I REALLY DID I REALLY DID THINK THAT IT TURNED OUT THAT CAR JUST TURNED AROUND AND WENT THE OTHER WAY I GUESS IT HAD BEEN GOING ON SOMEWHERE ELSE
BUT IT IS A SMALL THING BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT THIS MARK IS THE BEGINNING OF THE TRAJECTORY OF FEAR IN MY NARRATIVE
AND
IT STARTED TO GET ME TO THINK ABOUT
THE OTHER AS SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF IS SOMETHING THAT I NEEDED TO FEAR
AS I GREW OLDER AND FACED THE PROSPECT OF INDEPENDENCE MY PARENTS
WEREN'T SO COMFORTABLE WITH ME TAKING THE BUS BY MYSELF
MY DAD WOULD INSIST ON DRIVING ME TO MY MEETINGS IN MY EVENTS BECAUSE HE FOUND THAT I WOULD BE SAFER THAT WAY
AND
OF COURSE THIS WOULD GET ME TO THINK WELL I GUESS THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE BUS THAT I NEED TO BE AFRAID OF MAYBE I SHOULD
YOU KNOW STAY AWAY MAYBE I SHOULD KEEP MY DISTANCE
I
BUT THAT IS GENERALLY THE CASE I REALIZED AND I THOUGH OKAY SO
I CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN FEAR IN THIS WAY
OR MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH I CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND MAYBE SLOWLY WE CAN LIFT OURSELVES OUT OF THIS IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY
ANOTHER
HIS ENTIRE SUMMER WORKING A DIFFERENT JOB EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO COOL IMAGE HOW MUCH HE LEARNED ABOUT HIMSELF ABOUT WHAT HE LIKES ABOUT WHAT HE DOESN'T LIKE ABOUT
WHAT THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE
ARE LIKE SO THIS SUMMER I HAD A BIT OF FREE TIME I WAS WORKING A COUPLE OF CONTRACT JOBS BUT I HAD SOME FREE TIME TO KILL AND I WANTED TO START A PROJECT OF MY
OWN SO I REFLECTED ON
WHAT THE KIND OF THINGS WERE THAT ENERGIZE ME IN MY LIFE AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE ONE ON ONE CONVERSATIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE WITH PEOPLE
SO OFTEN WE ASKED EACH OTHER YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU DO WHERE DO YOU WORK AND WE NEVER REALLY ASKED THOSE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU LOVE WHAT DRIVES YOU AND I WANTED TO START ASKING MORE MEANINGFUL QUESTIONS LIKE THIS
AND SO
I GREW UP KIND OF A PERFECTIONIST AND THIS IS MY LAST DISCLAIMER BUT I GREW UP AS KIND OF A PERFECTIONIST WHERE I'D LIKE TO PLAN THESE PROJECT OUT AND I REALIZED OVER TIME THAT
YOU'RE PLANNING OUT PROJECTS METICULOUSLY SOMETIMES IT PREVENTS YOU FROM STARTING THEM AT ALL
SO
I DECIDED ON A DATE I SAID JULY FIRST I'M JUST GONNA START THIS PROJECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE BUT I'M JUST GOING TO DO IT AND SO I DID
SO IT TURNED OUT THAT ON JULY FIRST I HAD
JUST MOVED INTO A NEW BUILDING AND I HAD BOXES EVERYWHERE BUT I STILL WANTED TO STICK TO THE DATE AND SO I WENT AND KNOCKED ON ONE OF MY NEIGHBOR'S
ARE SO WISE WE HEAR QUOTES ALL THE TIME FROM PEOPLE LIKE GANDHI AND NELSON MANDELA AND THESE QUOTES ARE FAMOUS FOR A REASON
BUT I THINK THERE IS SO MUCH WISDOM IN THE EVERYDAY PERSON
SO MUCH RELATABLE WISDOM TOO
AND SO ONE OF THESE PIECES OF WISDOM FROM REBECCA
WAS THAT WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET WHAT IT IS THAT WE LOVED TO DO WHEN WE WERE A CHILD
AND I LOVE THAT I THOUGHT BACK TO MY OWN LIFE AND MY MOM SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HOW APPARENTLY I USED TO LIKE WRITNG LOT AND I WOULD WRITE ALL OF THESE BOOKS BUT I WOULD NEVER FINISH WRITING
THEM SO THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTING ALL OF THE STORIES ON MY BLOG AND IT IS BEEN
A WAY TO KEEP MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO WRITINGING STORIES AND FINISHING THEM AND
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY NEAT PIECE OF ADVICE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERY ONE HERE TO THINK BACK ABOUT WHAT THOSE THINGS WERE THAT YOU LOVED BEFORE BEING EXPOSED TO THE WORLD AND GROWN UP LIFE AND MAYBE EVEN ASKING YOUR PARENTS YOU KNOW LIKE DID I HAVE ANY WEIRD HABITS OR HOBBIES WHEN I WAS A KID AND I WONDER IF I STILL HAVE IT THIS
IT IS ABSOLUTELY VALID AND I CANNOT BLAME MY PARENTS
FOR BEING SO PROTECTIVE OVER ME BUT
I AM NOT SURE THAT LIVING IN FEAR IS THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN RESPOND TO THIS
AND SO I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT A STORY THAT
STORY OF A PROJECT THAT I STARTED CALLED 101 DAYS 101 STRANGERS 101 STORIES WHERE FOR 101 CONSECUTIVE DAYS I SET OUT TO MEET A NEW STRANGER EACH DAY TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR STORY ABOUT WHAT DRIVES THEM AND THE THING IS THAT WHEN I STARTED THIS PROJECT IT WAS NEVER ABOUT MAKING MY COMMUNITY MORE SAFE AND ABOUT MAKING MYSELF FEEL MORE SAFE I ACTUALLY CAME OUT IT FROM KIND OF BACKWARDS WAY
AND SO
ARE OBJECTIVE TOOLS TO DETECT THE DISEASE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE PROGRESSION OBJECTIVELY AND ULTIMATELY THE ONLY
WHAT IF PATIENTS COULD DO THAT TEST THEMSELVES RIGHT NO EXPENSIVE STAFF TIME REQUIRED TAKES ABOUT 300 BY THE WAY IN THE NEUROLOGIST'S CLINIC TO DO IT
LOGISTICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH PATIENTS NO NEED TO GO TO THE CLINIC FOR ROUTINE CHECKUP WE CAN DO HIGH FREQUENCY MONITORING TO GET OBJECTIVE DATA WE CAN PERFORM
BOTH ACCURATE OKAY BUT IN ADDITION VOICE BASED TESTS ARE NON EXPERT
THE CLINICAL TRIALS IT'S JUST NEVER DONE IT'S NEVER DONE BUT
TO RECORD A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VOICES WORLDWIDE TO COLLECT ENOUGH DATA TO START TO TACKLE THESE FOUR GOALS WE HAVE LOCAL NUMBERS ACCESSIBLE TO THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ANYONE HEALTHY OR WITH PARKINSON'S CAN CALL IN CHEAPLY AND LEAVE RECORDINGS A FEW CENTS EACH AND I'M
WORK AND NOW HE HAS PROVED THAT IT WORKS OVER THE MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORK AS WELL WHICH ENABLES THIS PROJECT AND WE'RE GETTING 99 PERCENT ACCURACY TR NINETY NINE WELL THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT SO
PERCENT ACCURATE RIGHT NOW ML IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN THAT ACTUALLY MY STUDENT THANASIS I HAVE TO PLUG HIM BECAUSE HE'S DONE
PEOPLE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL WHO'S HEALTHY AND WHO'S NOT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THOSE SAMPLES MAX LITTLE YEAH YEAH SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT
HAVE TO COORDINATE ALL OF THESE VOCAL ORGANS WHEN WE MAKE SOUNDS AND WE ALL ACTUALLY HAVE THE GENES FOR IT FOXP2 FOR EXAMPLE AND LIKE BALLET IT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF TRAINING I MEAN JUST THINK HOW LONG IT TAKES A CHILD TO LEARN TO SPEAK
WAY IN WHICH WE CAN TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS BECAUSE YOU SEE IN ONE SENSE AT LEAST WE ARE ALL VIRTUOSOS LIKE MY FRIEND JAN
WELL I DO APPLIED MATH AND THIS IS A PECULIAR PROBLEM FOR ANYONE WHO DOES APPLIED MATH IS THAT WE ARE LIKE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE HELL WE DO SO I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ATTEMPT TODAY TO TRY AND EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I DO SO
YOU HAVE TO INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THE DISEASE OR NOT YOU SEE TR RIGHT ML YOU SEE SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT DO IT THEY MAY NOT GET THROUGH IT BUT WE'LL GET A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF DATA THAT IS COLLECTED FROM ALL DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT'S GETTING IT IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MATTER BECAUSE THEN WE LOOKING AT IRONING OUT THE CONFOUNDING FACTORS AND LOOKING FOR THE ACTUAL MARKERS OF THE DISEASE TR SO
BLOOD TEST THAT YOU CAN DO AND THE BEST THAT WE HAVE IS LIKE THIS 20 MINUTE NEUROLOGIST
IS THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO {NS} TR PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CALL IN FROM THEIR MOBILE PHONES AND DO THIS TEST AND PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S COULD CALL IN RECORD THEIR VOICE AND THEN THEIR DOCTOR CAN CHECK UP ON THEIR PROGRESS SEE WHERE THEY'RE DOING IN THIS COURSE OF THE DISEASE
SO THESE VOCAL EFFECTS CAN ACTUALLY BE QUITE SUBTLE IN SOME CASES BUT WITH
WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CURE IS WHEN WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT FOR SURE
A NUMBER OF HABITS THAT WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM I'VE ASSEMBLED FOR YOUR PLEASURE HERE SEVEN DEADLY SINS OF SPEAKING
NATIONAL SPORT WE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WEATHER SPORT ABOUT POLITICS ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT ACTUALLY COMPLAINING IS VIRAL MISERY IT'S NOT SPREADING SUNSHINE AND LIGHTNESS IN THE
THROUGH PROSODY WHICH I THINK IS A SHAME SO LET'S TRY AND BREAK THAT
IN YOUR OWN TRUTH WHICH I THINK IS A LOVELY WAY TO PUT IT THE I IS
THAT THERE ARE FOUR REALLY POWERFUL CORNERSTONES FOUNDATIONS THAT WE CAN STAND ON IF WE WANT OUR SPEECH TO BE POWERFUL AND TO MAKE CHANGE IN THE WORLD
OR MONOTONOUS MONOTONE ALSO WE HAVE REPETITIVE PROSODY NOW COMING IN WHERE EVERY SENTENCE ENDS AS IF IT WERE A QUESTION WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A QUESTION IT'S A STATEMENT
WHEN SOMEBODY'S THAT NEGATIVE {LG} AND ANOTHER FORM OF NEGATIVITY COMPLAINING
FIRST OF ALL I THINK ABSOLUTE HONESTY MAY NOT BE WHAT WE WANT MEAN MY GOODNESS YOU LOOK UGLY THIS MORNING
YOU WANT WEIGHT
YOU NEED TO GO DOWN HERE TO THE CHEST YOU HEAR THE DIFFERENCE
WE VOTE FOR POLITICIANS WITH LOWER VOICES IT'S TRUE
BECAUSE WE ASSOCIATE DEPTH WITH POWER
AND WITH AUTHORITY
THAT'S
OF SILENCE IN A TALK IS THERE WE DON'T HAVE TO FILL IT WITH
REGISTER MAY NOT BE VERY USEFUL MOST OF THE TIME BUT THERE'S A REGISTER IN BETWEEN I'M NOT GOING TO GET VERY TECHNICAL ABOUT THIS FOR ANY OF YOU WHO ARE VOICE COACHES YOU CAN LOCATE YOUR VOICE HOWEVER SO IF I TALK UP HERE IN MY NOSE YOU CAN HEAR THE DIFFERENCE IF I GO DOWN HERE IN MY THROAT WHICH IS
WHAT YOU SAY IT'S ALSO THE WAY THAT YOU SAY IT YOU HAVE AN AMAZING TOOLBOX THIS INSTRUMENT IS INCREDIBLE AND
GO AND GET VOICE COACH AND THERE ARE AMAZING THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH BREATHING WITH POSTURE AND WITH EXERCISES TO IMPROVE THE TIMBRE OF YOUR
OUR LANGUAGE ACTUALLY SOMETIMES FOR EXAMPLE IF I SEE SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS AWESOME WHAT DO I CALL IT
NOT NICE
OF COURSE WHERE THIS ALL COMES INTO PLAY MOST OF ALL IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO IT MIGHT BE STANDING ON A STAGE LIKE THIS AND GIVING A TALK TO PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE PROPOSING MARRIAGE
ASKING FOR A RAISE
A WEDDING SPEECH WHATEVER IT IS IF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF
TO LOOK AT THIS TOOLBOX AND THE ENGINE THAT IT'S GOING TO WORK
PASS IT ON TO EVERYBODY ELSE AND DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND AGAIN HARD TO LISTEN TO SOMEBODY WHO IS BEING LIKE THAT
REALLY QUICKLY OR I CAN SLOW RIGHT DOWN TO EMPHASIZE AND AT THE END OF THAT OF COURSE IS OUR OLD FRIEND SILENCE THERE'S
CONSCIOUSLY FOR SOUND THAT WOULD BE A WORLD THAT DOES SOUND BEAUTIFUL AND ONE WHERE UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE THE NORM AND THAT IS AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING
THE HUMAN VOICE
IT'S THE INSTRUMENT WE ALL PLAY
IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL SOUND IN THE WORLD PROBABLY IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN START A WAR OR SAY I LOVE YOU
AND YET MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN THEY SPEAK PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN TO THEM
AND WHY IS THAT
SORRY ABOUT THAT IF I STARTLED ANYBODY OR I CAN HAVE YOU REALLY PAY ATTENTION BY GETTING VERY QUIET
TALKED ABOUT THAT ON THIS STAGE IN DIFFERENT PHASES WHAT WOULD THE WORLD BE LIKE IF WE WERE SPEAKING
A FEW TOOLS OUT THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO TAKE AWAY AND PLAY WITH WHICH WILL INCREASE THE POWER OF YOUR
COMING ALIVE WE'RE GOING TO DO THE TONGUE NEXT WITH EXAGGERATED LA LA LA
GETTING REALLY GOOD AT THIS AND THEN ROLL AN R RRRRRRR THAT'S LIKE CHAMPAGNE FOR THE
TO LISTEN I REMEMBER ONE DAY I SAID TO HER IT'S OCTOBER 1 TODAY AND SHE SAID I KNOW ISN'T IT
PEOPLE WHO SPEAK ALL ON ONE NOTE ARE REALLY QUITE HARD TO LISTEN TO IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROSODY AT ALL
THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WE PREFER VOICES WHICH ARE RICH SMOOTH WARM LIKE HOT CHOCOLATE WELL IF THAT'S NOT YOU THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD BECAUSE YOU
EVERY TALK I EVER DO ANY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO ANYBODY
THAT WE USE IN ORDER TO IMPART MEANING IT'S ROOT ONE FOR MEANING IN
YOU'RE LISTENING INTO THE WIND YOU KNOW SOMEBODY IS BOMBARDING YOU WITH THEIR OPINIONS AS IF THEY WERE TRUE IT'S DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO THAT
HABIT AND WE KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THE PERSON GOSSIPING FIVE MINUTES LATER WILL BE
TO CLOSE THIS IS A SERIOUS POINT HERE THIS IS WHERE WE ARE
I WANT TO SHARE EXCITING RESEARCH THAT I THINK CAN HELP MAKE PARENTING YOUR SWEET LITTLE BOY EASIER AND HELP YOU DECIDE
ABOUT THREE REALLY SIMPLE WAYS THAT MIGHT SEEM REALLY INTUITIVE TO YOU BIANCA BUT MANY PEOPLE
HE'S HAVING LOTS OF FEELGOOD SENSATIONS AND POSITIVE HORMONES THAT ARE BEING SECRETED HIS
HE MIGHT BE SAYING WHEN HE IS HAVING HIS COOS AND HIS GURGLES SOOTHING HIM WHEN HE IS FUSSY SINGING STORIES SHARING
WE DO IT BY INTERACTING WITH THEM AND RESPONDING TO THEIR NEEDS SO HOW DO YOU CREATE THE
CELLS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE SENSES ARE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE
I SAID EARLIER THE NEURONS THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER SO THAT HAD BECOME THE GO TO CENTER IN HER BRAIN THAT PATH
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THESE POSITIVE CONNECTIONS BECOME THE GO TO CENTER IN THE BABY'S BRAIN TALKING WITH HIM IS THE SECOND KEY POINT
UNFORTUNATELY BRING HIM REMEMBER THE
THINK THAT BABIES CRY JUST TO AGGRAVATE THEM OR BECAUSE THEY ARE SPOILED BUT THE REALITY IS THAT
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THESE SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL STRATEGIES INCLUDE
I WANT TO PROTECT YOU FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE REALLY GOOD
WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IS LOTS OF THE STRESS HORMONE CORTISOL BEING
WHEN THEY ARE BORN BUT MOST OF THE WIRING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN ACTUALLY HAPPENS AFTER BIRTH AND WHEN I SAY
BUT BY RESPONDING CONSISTENTLY AND APPROPRIATELY YOU ARE WIRING HIS BRAIN TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL AND LIFE LATER
SO BIANCA AND ERIC AND THE REST OF YOU
THEIR CALM DOWN SYSTEM IN THEIR BRAIN DOESN'T BEGIN TO COME ON LINE UNTIL AFTER THEY ARE ONE YEAR OLD SO WHEN WE HOLD OUR BABIES WHEN THEY CRY AND GET
HOPE THAT THOSE OF YOU LISTENING TO THIS TALK CAN ALSO USE THIS INFORMATION
WORLD IS ANYTHING BUT SILENT ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDS ARE INAUDIBLE
ON THE SURFACE AND WHAT'S GOING ON UNDERWATER YOU CAN LOOK OUT
WITH DECREASES IN SEASONAL SEA ICE NOT ONLY IS THE ARCTIC NOW OPEN TO THIS WAVE NOISE BUT THE NUMBER OF STORMS AND THE INTENSITY OF STORMS IN THE ARCTIC HAVE BEEN INCREASING ALL OF THIS IS
SO SIGNALS CAN BE HEARD OVER GREAT DISTANCES IN THE ARCTIC THIS IS ESPECIALLY
OUR SENSE OF SIGHT IS HOW WE NAVIGATE OUR WORLD FOR MARINE MAMMALS THAT
THE NOISE FROM WIND DOESN'T MAKE IT INTO THE WATER COLUMN BECAUSE THE ICE ACTS AS A BUFFER BETWEEN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE WATER
THAT THESE WHALES WERE ALIVE IN 1956 WHEN JACQUES COUSTEAU MADE HIS FILM
AS DAYS LENGTHEN AND SPRING COMES
THAT MIGHT INDICATE HEAVY ICE AHEAD OR
THE EXTENT OF ICE CHANGING BUT THE AGE AND THE WIDTH OF ICE IS TOO YOU MAY WELL HAVE HEARD THAT A DECREASE IN SEASONAL SEA ICE IS CAUSING LOSS OF HABITAT FOR ANIMALS THAT RELY ON SEA ICE
AND LATER IN {NS} WE ARE HEARING IN ESSENCE AN INVASION OF THE ARCTIC BY SUB ARCTIC SPECIES AND WE DON'T
TO AS AN INCREASE IN THE OPEN WATER SEASON THAT IS THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE ARCTIC IS
SO THEY HAVE TO SURFACE TO BREATHE THEY MIGHT LISTEN FOR THIN ICE
AND MAMMALS CLIMATE CHANGE AND DECREASES IN SEA ICE ARE ALSO ALTERING THE UNDERWATER
AND BELUGA WHALES WALRUSES AND BEARDED SEALS THE ICE TOO MAKE SOUNDS IT
WE NOW KNOW THAT SHIP NOISE INCREASES LEVELS OF STRESS HORMONES IN WHALES AND CAN DISRUPT FEEDING BEHAVIOR AIR GUNS
THE HARD WORK OF REVERSING OR AT THE VERY LEAST DECELERATING HUMAN CAUSED ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES
THE SOUNDS YOU WOULD HEAR WOULD AT FIRST AMAZE AND THEN DELIGHT YOU WHILE YOUR EYES ARE SEEING
PERHAPS IT REALLY WAS THE SILENT WORLD THANK YOU
STICKING OFF OF YOUR BACK IS NOT VERY CONDUCIVE TO MIGRATING THROUGH ICE AND MAY IN FACT BE EXCLUDING ANIMALS FROM THE ICE
SHIP WE CAN RESTRICT ACCESS IN SEASONS AND REGIONS
A DOCUMENTARY BY JACQUES COUSTEAU
PAST SUMMER A MASSIVE CRUISE SHIP MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE THE ONCE MYTHICAL ROUTE BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE PACIFIC
WE CAN'T DECREASE WIND SPEEDS OR KEEP SUB ARCTIC ANIMALS FROM MIGRATING NORTH BUT WE CAN WORK ON
WHEN THE ICE IS FROZEN SOLID AND THERE'S NO BIG TEMPERATURE SHIFTS OR CURRENT CHANGES THE UNDERWATER ARCTIC HAS SOME OF THE LOWEST AMBIENT NOISE
MARINE MAMMALS ARE USED TO VERY HIGH LEVELS OF NOISE AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR BUT THIS IS PRIMARILY FROM OTHER ANIMALS
THAT ARE VITAL TO THEIR VERY SURVIVAL THESE NEW SOUNDS ARE LOUD AND THEY ARE ALIEN THEY MIGHT IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT IN WAYS THAT WE THINK WE UNDERSTAND
TO STUDY THEIR HABITAT TO KEEP IN COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OTHER TO NAVIGATE TO DETECT
AND THIS NOISE IS LIKE A HISS OR A STATIC IN THE BACKGROUND
OR POLAR BEARS DECREASING SEA ICE IS ALSO CAUSING INCREASED EROSION
WE CAN GET SMARTER ABOUT QUIETING SHIPS AND FIND BETTER WAYS TO EXPLORE
AND VOCAL BEHAVIOR OF WHALES ALL OF THESE SOUND SOURCES ARE DECREASING THE ACOUSTIC SPACE
FOOD BETWEEN ARCTIC AND SUB ARCTIC ANIMALS MIGHT THESE SUB ARCTIC SPECIES INTRODUCE DISEASES OR PARASITES INTO THE ARCTIC WHAT ARE THE NEW
DO I MEAN BY SOUNDSCAPE THOSE OF US WHO EAVESDROP ON THE OCEANS FOR A LIVING USE INSTRUMENTS
AS IT COLLIDES AND RUBS WHEN TEMPERATURE OR CURRENTS OR WINDS CHANGE AND UNDER 100 SEA ICE IN THE DEAD OF WINTER BOWHEAD WHALES ARE SINGING
SOUNDSCAPE CAN BE AS NOISY AS ANY JUNGLE OR RAIN
FOR THESE ANIMALS AND NOT ONLY IS THE PHYSICAL HABITAT OF THE ARCTIC CHANGING RAPIDLY BUT THE ACOUSTIC HABITAT IS TOO IT'S AS IF WE
STRAIGHT FOR ME I HAD TO IT WAS YEAH AS YOU CAN PROBABLY WELL IMAGINE I WAS A STRANGE CHILD
BUT THEY'RE SKETCHES AT BEST WHICH IS WHAT'S ANNOYED ME IF ONLY IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY FOR THESE IDEAS TO COME OUT UNIMPEDED BY THE RESTRICTIONS WHICH MY BODY GIVES
THEY'RE RATHER UNUSUAL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING THINGS WHICH ARE AS UNUSUAL AS THIS IT CAN BE HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
WHICH IS LIKE {NS} BUT THAT'S CHEATING AND IT HURTS YOUR THROAT SO THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN'T DO AND THESE LIMITATIONS ON THE HUMAN VOICE HAVE ALWAYS
NOT OBVIOUS THAT IT IS THE HUMAN VOICE BUT IT IS SO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH IT BIT BY BIT AND START NICE AND
ASSISTANT THIS SYSTEM HAS NO SOUNDS IN IT ITSELF UNTIL I START PUTTING SOUNDS IN IT SO THERE'S NO PRERECORDED
{NS} I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO ASK YOURSELVES A QUESTION WHICH YOU MAY NEVER HAVE ASKED YOURSELVES BEFORE WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITH THE HUMAN VOICE WHAT
ONE'S VOICE CAN DO FOR EXAMPLE NO ONE CAN DO TWO NOTES AT THE SAME TIME YOU CAN DO TWO TONE SINGING WHICH MONKS CAN
IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE IMMEDIATE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE WITH LIVE LOOPING THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO LAYER YOUR VOICE UP THERE'S THINGS LIKE PITCH SHIFTING WHICH ARE AWESOME AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NOW WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE SO I'M GOING TO
THE THING IS I WAS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO EXTEND MY REPERTOIRE OF NOISES TO BE THE VERY MAXIMUM THAT IT COULD BE I WAS
OF 2012
WINTER WAS ENDING OR SO I THOUGHT AND THE WINTER OF MY DISCONTENT WAS BEGINNING
WHEN I PURCHASED A DEVICE THAT WOULD SLOWLY
BEGIN TO RUIN MY LIFE
AND
MY HUSBAND IS RIGHT HERE AND HE IS SMILING BECAUSE HE LIVED THROUGH THIS WITH ME
THE DEVICE THAT I PURCHASED WAS A PEDOMETER YOU
THINK A PEDOMETER
BUT SOME OF YOU ARE THINKING
THE LIVING ROOM THE KITCHEN AND THE DINING ROOM AND THE LIVING ROOM THE KITCHEN AND THE DINING ROOM
DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT CHECK IT IN A DAY OR WEEK MAN EVERY FIVE MINUTES ZO C EVERY FIVE
THOSE DEVELOPERS DEVELOPED A GAME INSIDE STRIIV IT'S CALLED MY LAND
NOTHING HAPPENS EXCEPT THAT PLANTS GROW AND BUILDINGS GET BUILT AND NOTHING HAPPENS
BUT THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTIVE
THAT YOU
JUST
CAN'T STOP I WOULD SAY THE LAST STRAW
WAS
NO TECH REHEARSAL AND NO GUARANTEE OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU GET THERE
YOU'RE MEETING A NEED FOR CONNECTION BECAUSE GROUP ACTIVITIES AND ESPECIALLY SYNCHRONIZED MOVEMENTS THEY CREATE RAPPORT
SO WHEN YOU'RE
COMING TOGETHER IN A FLASH MOB WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT'S AS IF YOU BECOME THIS GROUP ENTITY
AND YOU CAN ALSO BE MEETING YOUR NEED FOR GROWTH IF YOU ARE A PERSON WHO
DEVICE YOU KNOW THE GAME FARMVILLE IT'S THAT REALLY BORING GAME WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS BUT IT'S
I AM JUST CURIOUS DO YOU HAVE PEDOMETER HAVE YOU HAD ONE NO IF YOU HAD ONE
RIGHT AND THIS STRIIV ALSO HAS ADAPTIVE BENCHMARKS SO YOU START OUT GETTING PRIZES AT 10000 STEPS BUT THEN WHEN YOU
BEING SOMEONE WHO DOES THINGS THAT ARE FUN
INTERESTING AND SPONTANEOUS YOU'RE CREATING STORIES THAT YOU CAN SHARE POTENTIALLY EVEN WITH YOUR GRAND CHILDREN
SO FLASH MOBS FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE
NOT SO CRAZY THAT IT BECAME SO POPULAR RIGHT
LET'S THINK ABOUT
JUDGMENT OF YOU AS A PERSON
SO YOU CAN STILL FEEL SAFE AND SECURE
YOU'RE MEETING YOUR NEED FOR UNCERTAINTY
BECAUSE AS WE SAID VARIETY IT'S THE SPICE OF LIFE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT ALSO THIS IS A THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE WITH
ARTICLE ANYTHING THAT I DIDN'T NEED TO BE AT THE COMPUTER TO DO AND I WOULD PACE DOWN THE
IF YOU JUST CLIMB TWENTY STAIRS AND THAT'S NOT A LOT
TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS YOU CAN DO IT PROBABLY IN MINUTE SO NO PROBLEM I GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT CLIMBED TWENTY STAIRS
I DON'T HAVE
TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN MY BASEMENT BUT YOU KNOW UP AND DOWN LIKE A TREADMILL BUT I FINISH IT AND THEN ANOTHER CHALLENGE POPS UP AND IT SAYS GREAT HOW ABOUT 40 STEPS AND WE'LL TRIPLE THE POINTS AGAIN AND THESE ARE THE POINTS YOU CAN USE IN THAT CRAZY VIRTUAL WORLD SO
TWELVE STEP PROGRAM BUT THAT WOULD HAVE SEEMED LIKE ANOTHER CHALLENGE {LG} SO THE ONLY OPTION WAS TO GO COLD TURKEY AND AT THIS POINT I THOUGHT IT WAS MY PROBLEM SO I GAVE THIS STRIIV TO MY SISTER
TIMES A DAY WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS
THAT I WAS SPENDING HOURS A DAY COUNTING MY STEPS
AND I FOUND THAT EVEN WHEN I WASN'T MOVING
I WAS STILL COUNTING
THE BLESSING OF THE STAIRS EPISODE WAS THE NECK INJURY
WHEN THE NECK INJURY HAPPENED I HAD TO TAKE A BREAK FROM EXERCISING WHICH ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A BREAK FROM THE STRIIV AND
I FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT MY HUSBAND HAD BEEN SAYING FOR A WHILE
I WOULD HAVE GONE
DEAL IT'S A GOOD EXCHANGE RATE FOUR MORE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS A BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIST APPARENTLY SO FOUR MORE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AND THERE'RE MORE CHALLENGES AND EVEN WITHOUT THE CHALLENGES I FOUND THAT I
PRESENT
AND I DO NOTICE THAT MANY OF THE TIMES THAT WE TALK TO EACH OTHER SHE'S WALKING AROUND OUTSIDE IT'S
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD THING UNTIL MY MOM CALLS ME AND SHE TELLS THAT MY SISTER MIKA HAS BEEN WALKING AROUND OUTSIDE IN CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS WHICH MANY OF YOU KNOW IS AND URBAN AREA
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND SHE'S WALKING FOR MILES
SHE'S TAKING HER LIFE INTO HER
BECAUSE SHE WAS WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH ME ON MY LAP AND FOOL WITH THE FREAKING PEDOMETER WITH ME {LG} SO THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT I WAS GETTING CLOSER
ALREADY FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE COMPLETING CHALLENGES SO YOU'RE FEELING POWERFUL YOU'RE KICKING ASS AND ALSO YOU HAVE THIS VIRTUAL WORLD WHERE YOU ARE PLAYING GOD IT'S THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND A WHOLE WORLD DEPENDS ON YOU IT'S
IT'S MAYBE LIKE A DRUGGY WHO FEELS CONNECTED TO THEIR DEALER
THE FINAL
HUMAN NEED
IS THE NEED FOR GROWTH
THIS IS THE NEED TO FEEL THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD THAT WE'RE BECOMING SOMETHING
RESEARCH ON MOTIVATION IN ORGANIZATIONS
FINDS THAT
THE MOST
POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT IS A SENSE OF PROGRESS THAT WHATEVER JOB YOU'RE DOING IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS FROM DAY TO DAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT YOUR JOB
AND WHEN YOU HAVE PEDOMETER EVEN IF IT'S NOT A COOL ONE LIKE
WAS DETERIORATING I SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER SHE WAS THREE AT THE TIME AND I ONLY SPENT TIME WITH
IN YOUR PHYSICAL BODY MOST OF THEM BEING GOOD MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM SO
THERE'S A LOT OF GROWTH YOU CAN EXPERIENCE AND YOU'RE ALSO EXPERIENCING GROWTH
IS THAT DESPITE BEING TOTALLY INSANE WE'RE NOT ALONE THE AVERAGE STRIIV USER THE AVERAGE ONE NOT THE CRAZY ONE CHECKS THEIR
LIKE CRAZY
THIS IS ALSO WHY WE BUY LOTTERY TICKETS WE KNOW THAT IT IS STUPID
BUT SOMETIMES WE WIN AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE ARE GOING TO WIN
AND WITH STRIIV AS I WAS SHARING WITH YOU THERE'RE THESE UNPREDICTIBLE LITTLE POP UP CHALLENGES THAT ARE SO TEMPTING YOU CAN'T
I HAVEN'T STARTED ANY MASS MOVEMENT
I DON'T HAVE A MASS MOVEMENT TO START BUT I CAN SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE
I'LL BE TALKING WITH YOU TODAY
ABOUT A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THINGS THAT CREATE ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
AND IT'S NOT MY ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS THAT QUALIFY ME TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU
IT'S MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS AN ADDICT
AND I'M COMING CLEAN TODAY
TELLING THIS STORY FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND ITS RAW UGLY DETAIL
THIS POINT I THINK IT'S KIND OF DISTURBING AND WRONG FOR SOME REASON BUT YOU CAN EVEN HIRE A COMPANY TO PUT ON FLASH MOB FOR YOU
SO
WHAT IS IT ABOUT FLASH MOBS THAT HAS MADE THEM GO VIRAL AND LOOKING AT THE SIX HUMAN NEEDS AGAIN LET'S THINK ABOUT IT SO NEED FOR SIGNIFICANCE YOU'RE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION AND I AM TAKING IN A PERSPECTIVE OF THE FLASH MOBER WHICH IS ANOTHER TERM IN THE DICTIONARY
YOU'RE MEETING YOUR NEED FOR SIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE YOU GET TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT YOU AND YOU'RE CREATING AN EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REMEMBER AND MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RELIVE THIS EXPERIENCE AND EVEN WATCH YOU ONLINE
YOU'RE MEETING A NEED FOR CERTAINTY INTERESTINGLY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING PRETTY WEIRD
YOU'RE DOING IT IN A GROUP
A FLASH MOB PERFORMANCE IS AN ENSEMBLE PIECE AND THERE'S
THE THIRD HUMAN NEED
IS UNCERTAINTY
AND THIS IS OUR NEED FOR SENSE OF VARIETY AND SURPRISE AND SPICE
IN LIFE
IF YOU ARE A RAT
AND YOU GET FOOD PELLETS BY PRESSING A LEVER
WHEN IT'S UNPREDICTIBLE HOW MUCH AND WHEN YOU'LL GET
AND BETWEEN MIDNIGHT
AND TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
TWO HOURS THAT I'D PLANNED ON SLEEPING I AM GOING LIKEA NUTCASE UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS IN MY BASEMENT 2000 STAIRS I CLIMBED
I HURT MY NECK AND
MY NECK IS INJURED BECAUSE MY HEAD MY STUPID HEAD IS BOUNCING UP DOWN LIKE THIS
AND AT THIS TIME I HAD BECOME
SO
I THINK
THIS IS A PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY A DEVICE LIKE STRIIV CAN BE SO ADDICTIVE
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD PREDICT WHICH BEHAVIORS WOULD SPREAD
AND WHICH BEHAVIORS WILL NOT LET'S TAKE A DIFFERENT EXAMPLE
WITHIN STRIIV
LET'S TAKE FLASH MOBS
SO A FLASH MOB IS FROM
ALL APPEARANCES KIND OF LIKE A SPONTANEOUSLY GENERATED MASS MOVEMENT
A
FLASH MOB IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ORGANIZE ON THE INTERNET
CONVENE AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION
DO SOMETHING BIZARRE AND USUALLY POINTLESS AND THEN DISPERSE
TO ME
IN THEORY THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AN IDEA WORTH SPREADING
BUT IN PRACTICE IT
THE FIRST FLASH MOB HAPPENED IN FEBRUARY 2003 AND BY 2004 FLASH MOB WAS IN THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY
AT THIS POINT THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION WHICH IS NOT THE VANGUARD OF COOL THEY HAVE A WHOLE PAGE ON THEIR WEBSITE DEDICATED TO FLASH MOB LAW
AND THE FIRST FLASH MOB WAS COMPLETELY LAME
I THINK
200 PEOPLE CONVENED IN A DEPARTMENT STORE
TO LOOK AT A PARTICULAR RUG AND SAY THEY WERE TRYING TO BUY A LOVE RUG FOR THEIR GROUP APARTMENT
BUT
THEY GOT COOLER
SO YOU'VE SEEN THEM ON THE INTERNET IF YOU HAVEN'T PARTICIPATED IN ONE THERE'S LOT OF SINGING AND DANCING SYNCHRONIZE MOVEMENT
ZOMBIE RACES
WHO DOESN'T LOVE THAT PILLOW FIGHTS WITH FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN GRAND CENTRAL STATION YOU HAVE
UP IN THE NEED FOR SECURITY ALL SPECIES HAVE THE NEED TO FEEL SAFE AND SECURE AND WE WANT TO KNOW THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE WORLD ARE LIKELY TO BE
LEAST MUCH OF THE TIME IN STRIIV DEVICE YOU HAVE CERTAINTY
IT'S HARD
RIGHT THIS IS NOT TRIVIAL 10000 STEPS IS 5 MILES
WHEN I WAS USING THE STRIIV I
WAS GOING 24000 STEPS A DAY YOU DO THE MATH
I'M NOT A DISTANCE RUNNER
AND
I FOUND OUT RECENTLY HOW MANY TIMES THE AVERAGE STRIIV USER CHECKS THEIR
AND WE TALK ON THE PHONE AND WE'RE COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER SHE'S LOVES IT SHE'S SO HAPPY IT'S
FORTH HUMAN NEED
IS OUR NEED FOR CONNECTION
AND THIS IS THE NEED THAT ENSURES OUR SURVIVAL AS SPECIES
IT'S WHAT ALLOWS US AND
ENCOURAGES US AND EVEN FORCES US TO FORM SOCIAL GROUPS
IT'S HOW WE MAKE BABIES
IT'S WHY WE TAKE CARE OF OUR BABIES
AND I TOLD YOU THAT WHEN I WAS USING THIS STRIIV MY FAMILY LIFE WAS FALLING APART
BUT I WAS FEELING CONNECTED TO THESE OTHER CRAZY PEOPLE I WAS FEELING CONNECTED TO MY FRIEND ERNEST
THERE IS ALSO CERTAINTY THIS IS ANOTHER KEY DRIVER OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND THE NEED FOR CERTAINTY
FOR FIVE SECONDS AND THEN GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED {LG} FLASH MOBS ARE SPREADING ALL ACROSS THE WORLD VIDEOS ARE GOING VIRAL
TO SHARE WITH YOU IS A FRAMEWORK THAT IS THE SIX HUMAN NEEDS AND THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT WE SHARED FIRST WITH ME BY TONY ROBBINS WHO'S PULLED THESE NEEDS TOGETHER BUT IT'S BASED ON
HANDS WHEN SHE DOES THIS
YOU GUYS OTHER AREN'T ANY STREETWALKERS IN CAMBRIDGE IT'S MOSTLY COLLEGE KIDS BUT IT IS URBAN AND THE ONLY WOMEN WHO WERE WALKING AROUND AT NIGHT FOR MILES
AND
SHE'S CRAZY SHE'S POSSESSED BY
IN TIME WERE MY COLLEAGUE ERNEST WHO ALSO HAD A STRIIV SO WE COULD SET CHALLENGES AND WE COULD COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER AND WE COULD BOND OVER IT AND WITH THE COMMUNITY OF FREAKS ON THE INTERNET
WHO WERE ADDICTS LIKE ME
I WAS CREATING SPREADSHEETS
TO OPTIMIZE AND TRACK
NOT MY EXERCISING
BUT MY VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS IN A
WALK SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH 10000 STEPS A DAY AS AN IDEAL GOAL FOR LIVING A HEALTHY LIFE AND BEING A HEALTHY PERSON HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE TRIED AND MEASURED TRY TO REACH 10000
YOU'RE RUNNING YOU GET FIVE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WAKE UP THAT WHEN YOU CLIMB 374 STAIRS YOU WILL GET AN AWARD CALLED THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE LITTLE PICTURE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE
AND THEN I WAITED AND THEN I HAD THAT FUNNY FEELING WHERE I WONDER IF I HAD CROSSED THE LINE SO I WROTE ANOTHER TWEET ABOUT MY OWN COUNTRY BOTSWANA
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE WERE USING THE HASHTAG TO CONNECT THEY WERE CONNECTING OVER THEIR
AND THESE WERE THE SAME AFRICANS THAT I BEGAN TO MEET IN MY OWN TRAVELS
ELSE
SO I WAS BEING INTRODUCED TO MY NEW CULTURE TO MY NEW HOME MY NEW CULTURAL IDENTITY AS A COMPLETE OUTSIDER
WHO COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT WAS BEING SAID TO ME BY THE SOCIETY AND THE COUNTRY WHOSE TRADITIONS I WAS MEANT TO MOVE
IS AFRICA'S FUTURE ONLINE YES WE ARE AFRICA'S FUTURE AND YES WE ARE ONLINE THANK YOU
FAMILY IN LINE WITH THAT TRADITION FOR VERY LONG TIME ON PAPER THESE COUNTRIES SEEM VERY DIFFERENT BUT WHEN I WAS A KID I DIDN'T REALLY
WERE USING THIS HASHTAG TO POST PICTURES OF THEMSELVES TRAVELING AROUND THE CONTINENT TAKING OWNERSHIP OF OUR OWN TOURISM SECTOR IT WAS AFRICANS TAKING SELFIES ON THE BEACHES OF NIGERIA IT
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS A HASHTAG THE SOUTH AFRICAN STUDENTS ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY HASHTAG CALLED FEESMUSTFALL WHERE THEY PROTESTING RIDICULOUSLY HIGH TERTIARY
AND I REALIZED THAT EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE IN
PEOPLE WERE USING THE HASHTAG TO DO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE FUN OF THEIR STEREOTYPES
WOULD BEGIN TO LEARN ENGLISH AND SETSWANA BUT WHEN I RETURNED TO SWAZILAND I WOULD BE CONSTANTLY CONFRONTED BY THIS REALIZATION THAT I WAS NOT SO SWAZI
DEAL IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT IF YOU BOUGHT THE DEVICE FOR ROUGHLY 150 DOLLARS YOU COULD GET LIKE UNLIMITED INTERNET ON SOME REALLY REALLY GOOD RATES I THINK I PAID LIKE 15 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR
UNLIMITED ACCESS TO TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND ALL THIS STUFF AND IT WAS QUITE REMARKABLE
DESIGN MANY OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS THRIVE ON THEIR CITIZEN'S IGNORANCE ABOUT NEIGHBORING AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN SOUTH AFRICA DURING APARTHEID THE BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS WERE CONSTANTLY BOMBARDED BY THIS MESSAGE THAT
CULTURE LANGUAGE TRADITION GEOGRAPHY AND WHAT ALL THOSE THINGS MEAN MOST IMPORTANTLY I'VE KEPT WITHIN ME AN INTEREST IN THE IDEA OF AFRICAN PHILOSOPHIES
ENTIRE THING IS ABOUT BEATING THE AFRICANNESS OUT OF YOU AND I HAD A VERY PECULIAR ADOLESCENCE
THAT WE HAD BEFORE US BETWEEN US AT OUR FINGERTIPS A PLATFORM THAT ONLY NEEDED A SMALL SPARK
WHEN TURMOIL HITS WHEN DISASTER HITS WE SHARE THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN BURUNDIANS FLEE POLITICAL
WESTERN PAPER SOMEWHERE MIGHT MAKE SOMEONE CARE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AFRICANS ARE IN THE POSITION TO BACK EACH OTHER UP WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
A REAL AFRICAN BAR AND I WAS LIKE SO PUMPED I WAS EXITED FIRSTLY BECAUSE I GOT ON CNN BBC
WITH THE INTERNET WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESCUE EACH OTHER AND ULTIMATELY TO RESCUE OURSELVES I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ONE MORE STORY I HAVE 2 MINUTES
ILLEGALLY AND WE DISCUSS THESE THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME
HAVE A PLATFORM BEFORE IF YOU WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE YOUTH IN AFRICA
WHICH WASN'T EXACTLY ACCORDING TO THE RULES BECAUSE I'M NOT SOUTH AFRICAN BUT ALLUDING TO THAT CONTINUAL ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THAT RACIST PAST AND CREATE A
YOU'RE GOING TO BE TOLD THAT THESE ARE THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AND I DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO SENT ME THE MONEY PERSONALLY
BUT I COULDN'T NAME THE PRESIDENT OF MY NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AND TO ME THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
ACCESS TO ONLINE NETWORKS THAT MEAN THAT AFRICANS CAN NOW CONNECT IN A WAY THAT THEY NEVER COULD
WAS BORN HERE IN THIS STRANGE INTERSECTION OF KIND OF BELONGING TO TWO PLACES AT ONCE BUT NOT
FOR MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL WHICH I'M TENTATIVELY CALLING AFRICA THIS WEEK WITH SIYANDA I'S BASICALLY ME IN A ROOM WITH A CAMERA TALKING TO MYSELF ABOUT AFRICA AND HOPING THAT IT MAKES ANY KIND OF SENSE TO ANYBODY
63 DOLLARS {LG} BUT THOSE 63 DOLLARS MOVED ME SO DEEPLY AND I'M OVERCOME JUST REMEMBERING THAT FIRST NIGHT
MY IDEA WORTH SHARING TODAY IS THAT THE BEST WAY FOR US TO SHARE OUR SUCCESSES IS TO FOSTER SOMETHING I LIKE TO CALL SOCIAL PAN AFRICANISM
AT THAT TIME WHEN YOU WERE ON TWITTER IF YOU WERE TO GOOGLE THE WORD AFRICA OR LIKE TWITTER SEARCH AFRICA
SO THIS MEANT THAT IF YOU WERE GIRL IN BOTSWANA AND YOU REALLY WANTED TO HAVE
TELL YOU WHAT PLANS HE HAD FOR YOUR GENERATION IN 20 YEARS BEFORE NOW IF YOU WANTED TO BE HEARD BY YOUR POSSIBLY TYRANNICAL
YOU CAN FIND OUT WHERE THE MONEY WAS COMING FROM SO YOU CLICK ON THIS LITTLE ICON AND THEN IT LIGHTS UP A MAP AND SAYS THIS IS WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS CAME FROM WHEN I CLICKED THAT I GOT 5 COUNTRIES
ADD TO THAT THE STRANGE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN AFRICA WHICH HAS BEEN CARRIED OVER FROM COLONIAL TIMES AND AT THE AGE OF
SUDDENLY YOUR WHOLE WORLD OPENED UP AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP I FOLLOWED VIBRANT AFRICANS WHO WERE TRAVELING AROUND THE CONTINENT
MYSELF THAT I AM SO FUNNY AND EVEN IF NOBODY ELSE GETS IT IT DOESN'T MATTER {LG}
EXISTS BUT IT'S USUALLY THE UNITY OF AFRICAN LEADERS THEMSELVES AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
FRANCISCO I HAD NO IDEA WHEN I STEPPED ON THAT STAGE THAT MY
YOU CREATE THE PERSON THAT YOU WANT TO BE AND BE THAT PERSON YOU CANNOT FORCE PEOPLE TO CLAP FOR YOU SO
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY WANT EQUALITY BUT WHAT THEY MEAN IS THAT THEY WANT EQUALITY FOR ME NOT EQUALITY FOR THEM
THE SAME AS MY NUMBER ONE RULE FOR RELATIONSHIPS IN REAL LIFE DO NOT HANG
OFTEN JOKE THAT I'M THE MOST OPPRESSED PERSON IN THE WORLD
BUT THE REALITY IS I AM PRIVILEGED
I CHECK MY PRIVILEGE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND SO SHOULD YOU
THE WORLD IS BROKEN BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN FIX IT BY SAYING NO
SAY NO TO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AN EPIDEMIC THAT NEEDS TO END AND IS GLOBAL SAY NO TO THE MASSACRE OF CHILDREN AND NEVER BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY EXCUSE FOR TARGETING UNARMED CIVILIANS SAY NO TO BULLYING ONLINE AND YES TO POSTING PICTURES OF CATS DOING SILLY THINGS
YOU CAN DO IS MAKE THEM THE BEST PEOPLE THEY CAN BE AND FOR EVERYONE OF YOU OUT THERE WHO HAS A CHILD MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT RAISING AN INTERNET TROLL
I WIN AFTER DOING MY TED
YOU MAY SAY I'M A DREAMER BUT I AM NOT
IF I CAN CAN YOU CAN CAN {NS}
YOURSELF IS THIS WORTH MY PEACE OF MIND AND IF IT'S NOT PUT IT
I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE WHO TORTURE
YOUR LIFE CUT FUN SPONGES OUT I KNOW THAT THIS
I HAVE BEEN CALLED FAT I HAVE BEEN CALLED RETARDED I HAVE BEEN THREATENED WITH
ABILITY WHEN I WAS YOUNG SEXUAL ORIENTATION WAS STILL IN THE
THAT THIS RULE ALSO APPLIES TO THE REAL WORLD THE SAME WAY IT APPLIES ONLINE IF YOU HAVE NOTHING NICE TO SAY
TO HANG OUT WITH MEAN PEOPLE THIS DROVE MY PARENTS CRAZY BECAUSE AS
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY DON'T BE THAT PERSON
AND THIS DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO WALKING IT APPLIES TO LIFE IN GENERAL WITHOUT FAILURE CHILDREN CAN NEVER LEARN HOW TO
TO ADMIT THAT THIS STORY HAS TWO SIDES I DO KNOW THAT
TO THE NATIONS INSTEAD OF WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT STATE HAS HOSTED THREE MASSACRES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE CAN DO BETTER AND THE HOLY
ON ITS BOOTY MULTIPLE TIMES HELL I FELT AT THE ACROPOLIS
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IN THIS AUDIENCE DREAM BIG HAVE NO FEAR AND IF YOUR DREAM TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE LET IT GO AND FIND
I'M A COMEDIAN TAKING A RISK RIGHT NOW AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH GREECE FOR LETTING ME SO APPLAUSE FOR YOU
AND I WAS RAISED IN NEW JERSEY WHERE I GREW UP WE TREATED EVERYONE
IS TO TEAR DOWN THAT WALL AND
IS BROKEN BUT I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE CAN FIX IT MY NAME IS MAYSOON ZAYID
SO NOW ON PAYDAY WHAT I DO I PAY ALL OF MY BILLS I SET ASIDE WHATEVER I CAN IN
REALITY IS THIS PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS ALREADY COEXIST ONE GROUP HAS HUMAN
THEN THAT IS NOT A UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED RIGHT
WHEN I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF PEOPLE I IOATHED I HAD TO AND
MY FINAL PIECE OF ADVICE FOR A HAPPY LIFE IS NEITHER A BORROWER NOR A BORROWER BE GREECE I KNOW YOU FEEL ME
I APPLIED FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED CREDIT CARDS BECAUSE WHEN I
ON THEIR FAITH
WHAT I SAY IS THIS A SECULAR STATE DOES NOT DENY JEWISH PEOPLE A RIGHT TO THEIR IDENTITY OR A RIGHT TO SECURITY A SINGLE STATE WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ENHANCES ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS THE REALITY IS THIS EVERY SINGLE
THE SEPARATION BARRIER TO WORK ILLEGALLY IN ISRAEL IF WE ARE
OH YOU LIKE ME NOW BUT IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE OK {LG} ONE OF THE KEYS TO BEING HAPPY IS REALIZING THAT
THAT IT'S OKAY IF NOT EVERYBODY LIKES YOU IF AN IGNORANT HATEFUL
TO RAISE A SOCIETY THAT REALIZES THAT EVEN
OF FAITH ETHNICITY GENDER ABILITY AND BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST 2015 SEXUAL ORIENTATION TOO
NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN SEPARATE THESE SEMITES WHEN I SUGGEST ONE STATE PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND SAY BUT HAVING ONE STATE WILL DENY THE
WAS PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DRAINING I SQUISHED THAT STRESS BALL INTO A PANCAKE BUT WHEN I WAS FINALLY
SO NOBODY CAN EVER CONVINCE ME THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HAD WHITES AND
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM AND CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IS GREAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SELF CRITICIZE AS WELL AS SHARE
YOU TRY TO PROTECT THEM NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO SHIELD THEM FROM PAIN THEY HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO
THAT TALK ONE QUESTION KEEPS COMING UP HOW CAN YOU BE SO HAPPY WHEN THE WORLD IS SO BROKEN AND YOU HAVE
OTHERS SAY THAT GRANTING EQUALITY TO THE PALESTINIANS AND ALLOWING THE REFUGEES A RIGHT OF RETURN WILL DENY ISRAEL ITS RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION
I'VE LOOKED UP THE TERM SELF DETERMINATION AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL EQUALITY DOES NOT INFRINGE UPON THAT IN ANY WAY AND
YOU WOULDN'T STAND FOR IT YOU'D MAKE STINK YOU'D FOLLOW THAT GUY BACK TO HIS CUBICLE AND YOU'D SAY WHY MY CHAIR
MORE VALUABLE THAN OFFICE FURNITURE I'M TALKING ABOUT TIME YOUR TIME
SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD COMPANIES THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF BUT I WON'T NAME HAVE ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO USE THIS VIDEO IN THEIR NEW HIRE TRAINING TO TEACH THEIR NEW EMPLOYEES HOW NOT TO RUN A MEETING AT THEIR COMPANY
YEAH IT SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO ME TOO A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER I PUT THAT ONLINE 500000 PEOPLE IN DOZENS OF COUNTRIES I MEAN DOZENS OF COUNTRIES WATCHED THIS VIDEO AND THREE YEARS LATER IT'S STILL GETTING THOUSANDS OF VIEWS EVERY MONTH IT'S CLOSE TO ABOUT A MILLION RIGHT NOW AND
DAY WE ALLOW OUR COWORKERS WHO ARE OTHERWISE VERY VERY NICE PEOPLE TO STEAL FROM US AND I'M TALKING ABOUT
THOUSANDS OF COMMENTS POSTED ONLINE AFTER THE VIDEO WENT UP THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WROTE THINGS LIKE OMG THAT WAS MY DAY TODAY THAT WAS MY DAY EVERY DAY THIS IS MY LIFE
WITH THE PERSON WHO ASKED YOU TO THE MEETING TELL THEM YOU'RE VERY EXCITED TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK ASK THEM WHAT THE GOAL OF THE MEETING IS AND TELL THEM YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING HOW YOU CAN HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL AND IF WE DO THIS OFTEN ENOUGH
ALL THE NEXT TIME YOU GET A MEETING INVITATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN IT AT ALL CLICK
ALL OF THESE COMMENTS ONLINE IS THIS FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT WE ARE POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN GO TO MEETINGS AND SUFFER THROUGH THESE POORLY RUN MEETINGS AND LIVE TO MEET ANOTHER DAY
WHEN THEY COULD JUST DO A QUICK EMAIL AND GET IT DONE WITH PEOPLE JUST MIGHT START TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR BECAUSE YOU
YEARS {LG} AND WE'RE MISERABLE NOT BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY CAN'T RUN A GOOD MEETING IT'S BECAUSE OF MAS OUR MINDLESS ACCEPT SYNDROME
RIGHT AND COLLABORATION IS KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY ENTERPRISE AND A WELL RUN MEETING CAN YIELD REALLY POSITIVE ACTIONABLE RESULTS BUT BETWEEN
PICTURE THIS IT'S MONDAY MORNING YOU'RE AT THE OFFICE YOU'RE SETTLING IN FOR THE DAY AT WORK AND THIS GUY THAT YOU SORT OF RECOGNIZE FROM DOWN THE HALL WALKS RIGHT INTO YOUR CUBICLE AND HE STEALS YOUR CHAIR
BUT THE TRUTH IS WE'RE NOT POWERLESS AT ALL IN FACT THE CURE FOR MAS IS RIGHT HERE IN OUR HANDS IT'S RIGHT AT OUR FINGERTIPS LITERALLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT
TO YOUR DESK AND YOU STAND AT YOUR DESK AND YOU SAY BOY I WISH I HAD THOSE TWO HOURS BACK LIKE I WISH HAD MY CHAIR
WE DO IT RESPECTFULLY PEOPLE MIGHT START TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE WAY THEY PUT TOGETHER MEETING INVITATIONS AND YOU CAN MAKE MORE THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS ABOUT ACCEPTING IT PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY START
ACTUALLY I HAVE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT MAS IS A GLOBAL EPIDEMIC LET
ME TELL YOU WHY A
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I PUT A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
AND IN THE VIDEO I ACTED OUT EVERY TERRIBLE CONFERENCE CALL YOU'VE EVER BEEN ON
IT GOES ON FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND IT HAS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HATE ABOUT REALLY BAD MEETINGS THERE'S THE MODERATOR
WHO HAS NO IDEA HOW TO RUN THE MEETING
THERE ARE THE PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY'RE THERE
THE WHOLE THING KIND OF COLLAPSES INTO THIS COLLABORATIVE TRAIN WRECK
AND EVERYBODY LEAVES VERY ANGRY
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY
NO AGENDA THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHY YOU WERE INVITED TO THE MEETING AND YET YOU ACCEPT THE MEETING INVITATION AND YOU GO AND WHEN THIS HIGHLY UNPRODUCTIVE SESSION IS OVER
A PAIR OF JEANS THAT TRANSFORMS YOU MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD MAKES YOU FEEL
MAKES EVERYDAY LIFE MORE CHALLENGING THAN MOST FROM THE TIME HE COULD WALK WHICH WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HE HAD TO WEAR LEG BRACES FOR
THERE ARE ONE BILLION PEOPLE ON OUR PLANET THAT EXPERIENCE SOME TYPE OF DISABILITY ONE BILLION
AND THE OTHER MEN THAT WERE IN THERE BUT THEM I SAID OH PLEASE THERE'S NOTHING I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE {LG}
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS HE WOULD WEAR PROPER PANTS BUT MANY TIMES BECAUSE HE COULDN'T MANAGE THE BUTTON AND ZIPPER I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE HIM TO THE MEN'S ROOM WHICH WAS INCREDIBLY EMBARRASSING FOR
THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY OLIVER FELT SO ISOLATED WHEN HE COULDN'T WEAR WHAT HE WANTED TO WEAR
I BELIEVED THAT I JUST NEEDED TO EDUCATE THE INDUSTRY OF THE ENORMITY OF THIS POPULATION AND THE FACT THAT THESE WERE CONSUMERS
BORN WITH A RARE FORM OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY OR MD MD AFFECTS HIS MUSCLE STRENGTH HIS PULMONARY SYSTEM DISTORTS HIS
TOO CARED ABOUT FASHION HE CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY AND SAID VERY DEFINITIVELY
JEANS TRANSFORMED HIM HE WAS ABLE TO GET DRESSED ON HIS OWN HE WAS ABLE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM ON HIS OWN THOSE JEANS GAVE HIM CONFIDENCE
AND SO I DID IN 2013 I FOUNDED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED RUNWAY OF DREAMS
SO I REMOVED THE ZIPPER SO HE COULD PULL IT UP AND DOWN ON HIS
THAT HE WAS GOING TO WEAR JEANS TO SCHOOL LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE GETS TO WEAR WELL I CERTAINLY COULDN'T GO TO CLASS WITH HIM AND TAKE HIM TO THE BOYS' ROOM BUT THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS TELLING MY EIGHT YEAR OLD THAT HE COULDN'T WEAR WHAT HE WANTED TO WEAR
WHAT YOU WEAR MATTERS CLOTHING CAN AFFECT YOUR MOOD YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR SELF ESTEEM NOW BEING A FASHION LOVER
FORM OF MD DOES NOT AFFECT HIS MIND HIS BRAIN IS AN A PLUS WHICH MEANS HE'S ACUTELY AWARE OF HIS SHORTCOMINGS
CLOTHING CHALLENGES OF AS MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AS I POSSIBLY COULD I MET A YOUNG
AND THEN I WAS READY FOR THE BIG LEAGUES THE FASHION
MATTER WHAT HE WAS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
AND THE REST IS YET TO COME
RUNWAY OF DREAMS COLLABORATED WITH THE MOST AMAZING FORWARD THINKING
NOT BE AS CONFIDENT AS SUCCESSFUL OR EVEN AS HAPPY AS THEY COULD BE
THIS WAY GIANNA COULD WEAR A SHIRT RIGHT OFF THE RACK AND JUST ADJUST THE ONE
I ACTUALLY GO TO BED EVERY NIGHT THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO WEAR THE NEXT DAY CLOTHING TRANSFORMS ME DEFINES
CHASED DOWN PEOPLE ON THE STREET WHO WERE IN WHEELCHAIRS OR IF THEY HAD WALKERS OR EVEN IF THEY HAD A SLIGHT LIMP
REPLACED THEM WITH A MORE MANAGEABLE TECHNOLOGY MAGNETS MAGNETS MADE OUR HARVARD FRESHMAN ABLE TO WEAR JEANS ON CAMPUS BECAUSE HE COULD DRESS HIMSELF
SO THAT NIGHT I MACGYVERED THE HELL OUT OF HIS JEANS I REMEMBERED WHEN I WAS PREGNANT AND UNWILLING TO STOP WEARING MY OWN FAVORITE PANTS EVEN THOUGH I WAS BUSTING OUT OF THEM THAT RUBBER BAND
CLOTHING CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE CLOTHING EQUALS CONFIDENCE SO TOMORROW WHEN YOU ARE STARTING YOUR DAY AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
MY BOY HAS TOTAL SWAGGER
AS I MENTIONED
OLIVER'S DISEASE IS DEGENERATIVE
WHICH MEANS HIS MUSCLES ARE GOING TO BREAK DOWN OVER TIME
THIS BY FAR IS THE MOST DEVASTATING PART FOR ME
I HAVE TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES
AND WATCH MY BOY DETERIORATE
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT
SO
I AM LOOKING UP
FROM THE THINGS THAT I CANNOT CONTROL TO THE THINGS THAT I
I MET A LITTLE GIRL NAMED GIANNA WHO WAS MISSING HER LEFT FOREARM AND HER HAND
SHE HAD EVERY SINGLE LONG SLEEVE SHIRT PROFESSIONALLY TAILORED CAN YOU IMAGINE THE TIME AND MONEY SHE SPENT
CAN BE HEARTBREAKINGLY IRONIC MY MIDDLE CHILD
WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL LIKE A ROCK
CLOTHING IS DEFINED AS CLOTHING DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THE ELDERLY AND ANYONE WHO STRUGGLES WITH DRESSING THEMSELVES ADAPTIVE CLOTHING DID EXIST
ACTUALLY TAKE FIVE STEPS OFF HIS DRESSING PROCESS AND GIVE HIM BACK THE GIFT OF TIME
I GOT MYSELF INTO HARVARD BUT MY DREAM IS TO BE ABLE TO WEAR JEANS ON CAMPUS LIKE THE OTHER FRESHMEN WILL
THE MISSION WAS TO EDUCATE THE FASHION INDUSTRY THAT MODIFICATIONS COULD BE MADE TO MAINSTREAM CLOTHING FOR THIS COMMUNITY THAT HAS NEVER BEEN
THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROFESSOR IN THE UK BY THE NAME OF KAREN J PINE SHE WROTE A BOOK CALLED MIND WHAT YOU WEAR
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF FASHION
SHE STATES IN HER BOOK
THAT WHEN YOU PUT CLOTHES ON
YOU ADAPT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WHAT YOU'RE WEARING
THIS BECAME VERY EVIDENT WHEN HE STARTED SCHOOL AND THAT DAILY ACT OF DRESSING YOURSELF WAS A CONSTANT REMINDER OF WHAT HE COULD AND COULD NOT DO
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WANTED TO BE BETSEY JOHNSON I THOUGHT WE WERE KINDRED CRAZY HAIR SPIRITS TOGETHER
WHAT CAN I SAY I LIKE TO LOOK SHARP
RESEARCH DONE
I KNEW THAT IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY I HAD TO USE MY BACKGROUND
AND REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THESE CLOTHES
WAS PART OF THAT BECAUSE THIS RESEARCH IS NOT JUST SCIENTIFIC THIS RESEARCH IS PERSONAL I THINK FOR ALL OF US
MY MOTHER DIED FIVE YEARS AGO OF LUNG CANCER
SHE STARTED SMOKING IN THE ORPHANAGE
WHEN SHE WAS 14
SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ME WHEN SHE WAS 16
SHE MARRIED WHEN I WAS NINE
AND MY
DAD MY STEP DAD HER HUSBAND DIED FOUR YEARS LATER WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH
HER FOURTH CHILD
DURING ALL THIS TIME THE STRESSES BEING A SINGLE MOTHER
SHE STRUGGLED
WITH SMOKING
SHE TRIED TO QUIT SHE WOULD QUIT AND SHE'D START AGAIN JUST TIME AFTER TIME
AND THE TRAGEDY OF THIS
IS
NOT HER DEATH
THE TRAGEDY OF THIS
IS THAT SHE WANTED TO QUIT
SHE KNEW SHE SHOULD QUIT AND SHE DIDN'T QUIT
AND I SUFFERED DECADES OF
THAT HELPLESS HOPELESS GIVING UP
BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
A STUDY THAT WE'VE DONE THAT I THINK
HELPS GIVE US ALL MORE HOPE
WE DID
GIVE LIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THAT
LET'S SAY THAT I WANTED TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT
LET'S SAY THAT I WON THE LOTTERY
I GET TO GO ON A TV SHOW I
GET TO GO TO THE RANCH OR LET'S SAY I USE SOME OF MY MONEY AND I SIGN UP AT THE FARM OR I MAKE MYSELF SUBJECT TO LARGE PROGRAM
NOW I'M SUBJECT
AND PRETTY MUCH THEY'RE ALL THE SAME RIGHT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY TO EAT BETTER EAT LESS AND EXERCISE MORE
WHAT WILL WE PREDICT IF WE ANALYZE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE RANCH
SO WHEN I GO TO THE RANCH DO
YOU THINK
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH INFLUENCE
TO MAKE SURE I'M SUCCESSFUL
WELL LET'S ASK THAT A LITTLE
RID OF THE ICE CREAM AND THE CHIPS MAKE IT SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE YOU HAVE TO GET INTO YOUR CAR AND DRIVE AND DURING THOSE MOMENTS WE FOUND
THAT THIS WORKS FOR ALL ADDICTIONS IF YOU CAN REFOCUS YOUR BEHAVIORS IF YOU CANNOT SUCCUMB TO THE URGE
FOR THREE OF FOUR MINUTES
YOU CAN GET BACK TO WANTING TO DO YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR
I'M MAKING LIGHT OF THIS A LITTLE BIT
BUT RECIDIVISM AND RELAPSE
AND BEING SUBJECT INSTEAD OF AGENT
THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM
WE CAN GET INTO THE WILLPOWER TRAP WE CAN BECOME OUT NUMBERED
WE NEED TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE THINGS THAT CONTROL
HOME I'M GOING TO MEET SOME FRIENDS AND ACCOMPLICES I'M YOUR FRIEND LET'S GO CELEBRATE LET'S GO TO THE HOME TOWN BUFFET
WANT TO USE LITTLE METAPHOR WITH A ROPE PULLING TO MAKE THIS POINT
IF WE USE ENOUGH HEROIC EFFORT IF WE HAVE ENOUGH WILLPOWER
WE CAN MAKE CHANGE BUT THE FORCES PULLING AGAINST US WILL CAUSE THAT TO BE TEMPORARY
THIS FORCES WE'VE NAMED
SIX SOURCES OF INFLUENCES ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE AND SIX ONE AND TWO ARE PERSONAL MOTIVATIONAL ABILITY
DO I WANT TO CAN I DO
IT THREE AND FOUR ARE THE PEER PRESSURE THE SOCIAL PRESSURE THAT'S ALL AROUND US
AND SOURCES FIVE AND SIX ARE THE STRUCTURAL MOTIVATION LIKE INCENTIVES AND REWARDS OR THE ENVIRONMENT ITSELF
DIFFERENCE WE SAW BETWEEN THOSE WHO SUCCEEDED AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T IS
THE STORIES
OF SHARMAN
AJ AND TIM
THESE ARE CHANGERS WHO ALL MARSHALED OVERWHELMING INFLUENCE
FOR THEIR OVERWHELMING PROBLEMS
ALL OF THEM HAD SIX SOURCES OF INFLUENCES AND I'M ONLY GOING TO SHARE ONE IN EACH OF THESE
A PLAN TO BE RESILIENT
SHARMAN SAID I MADE A PLAN TO CALL MY SISTER AND WHEN I FELL OFF THE WAGON I'D CALL MY SISTER AND SHE'D SAY
WHY DID YOU DO IT WHAT WAS THE NEW CRUCIAL MOMENT WHY WERE YOU TEMPTED WERE YOUR INFLUENCES NOT ENOUGH AND SHE WOULD ANALYZE IT AND ADJUST
AND WHEN SHE DID THAT
SHE COULD BECOME RESILIENT
YOU'VE HEARD THAT STATEMENT I WISH I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW
I WISH I KNEW THEN
WHAT I KNOW NOW SO I COULD HAVE HELPED MY MOTHER
BECAUSE WHEN MY MOTHER TOOK ONE CIGARETTE AFTER 3 YEARS
OF NOT SMOKING
ONE DAY
SHE WOULD TURN INTO A BAD DECADE
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO TURN A BAD DAY INTO A GOOD DATA
VITAL BEHAVIOR IS WHAT WE DO NOT ALL BEHAVIORS ARE THE SAME THE VITAL BEHAVIORS ARE THE ONES CONNECTED TO THE RESULT AND CARRY A LOT OF OTHER BEHAVIORS WITH IT FIRST STEP THAT EVERYBODY DOES THEY SET A GOAL FIND YOUR CRUCIAL MOMENTS PERSONALIZE IT AND FIND THE BEHAVIORS YOU NEED TO DO AT THAT MOMENT
AND THEN THIS IS WHAT REALLY SEPARATES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REALLY
MAKE THIS SO THAT IT APPLIED TO ME AND MY GOALS MY STRENGTHS AND MY WEAKNESSES TO MY ENVIRONMENT WHEN THEY DID THAT THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE FOUR
ISN'T YOUR CARD THIS IS SHARMAN'S CARD WHEN SHE WAS AT LUNCH AND THEY WERE CELEBRATING SOMEONE'S BIRTHDAY AND SHE SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE THAT CHEESECAKE OR NOT SHE WOULD TAKE HER CARD OUT PRIVATELY AND THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY READ IT AND VERY OFTEN IT CAUSED HER TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE
HERE IS AJ
AMAZED OF THE POWER OF COLORED RIBBONS AND GOLD STARS COME PULL ON MY SIDE
I GET TO SOCIAL PRESSURE LET ME MAKE A LITTLE DISTINCTION FOR YOU THAT'S USEFUL
WE FIND THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRIENDS AND ACCOMPLICES
FRIENDS ARE SOMEONE WHO HELPS YOU
ACCOMPLICES ARE SOMEONE WHO HELPS YOU
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BUT WILL THERE BE FRIENDS AT THE
SO THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT'S THE LESSON WE LEARN FROM PEOPLE WHO CAN CONTROL THEIR OWN BEHAVIORS AND THE ONE'S THAT
MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN STUDYING
BEHAVIOR CHANGE FOR
OVER 30 YEARS
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THOSE
CRUCIAL BEHAVIORS THAT HELP
INDIVIDUALS IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND THE RESULTS IN THEIR LIFE AT WORK AND AT HOME
SOMETIME WHEN YOU DO RESEARCH IT'S
NOT JUST THE ANSWERS THAT ARE HARDEST IT'S THE QUESTIONS THE PROBLEM THAT'S HARD TO SEE BUT NO THIS ONE
WHEN IT COMES TO PERSONAL HABITS
IT'S REALLY EASY TO SEE THE PROBLEM
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE SICKER AND SADDER THAN THEY WANT TO BE OR NEED TO BE
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T CONTROL THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR
WHAT'S STANDING BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR HEALTH AND HAPPINESS BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS IS THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR
AND THEY DON'T WANT IT THAT WAY
NOBODY WANTS IT THAT WAY
BUT THEY HAVE THIS HUGE CHANGE
ALL OF OUR
BAD BEHAVIORS INCLUDING ADDICTIONS WE DON'T HAVE 24 7 TEMPTATIONS
THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES PLACES AND PEOPLE THAT PUT US MOST AT RISK
THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH WEIGHT LOSS AND WEIGHT GAIN WE'RE NOT TEMPTED ALL THE TIME I'VE GOT BREAKFAST DOWN PRETTY WELL I'VE GOT LUNCH AND I DON'T SNACK DURING THE DAY BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHEN I'M MOST TEMPTED
AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
WHEN I START WRITING AND READING AND THINKING
I FIND THAT I'M WAY MORE CREATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE
AT ABOUT A HALF PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH A PAGE
MY SECOND IS THAT
FOR YEARS I'D ONLY DO ONE SUGAR DRINK
A
DAY
AND THE THIRD ONE IS THAT WHEN I REALLY LIKED SOMETHING I WOULD LOAD IT UP I WOULD GO TO SECONDS MAYBE THIRDS
SO MY CRUCIAL MOMENTS ARE WHEN I'M MOST TEMPTED TO NOT FOLLOW MY PLAN TO ENGAGE IN MY BAD BEHAVIOR
BUT IF CRUCIAL MOMENTS TELL WHEN WE ARE AT RISK VITAL BEHAVIORS TELL US WHAT TO DO WHEN WE ARE AT RISK
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IS HOW THEY VIEW AND USE
AJ IS LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY TRY TO QUIT SMOKING
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE GO FOR SMOKING BREAKS WHEN THEY GO TO LUNCH WITH THE SAME PEOPLE SHE HAD TO GO TO THEM AND SAY WILL YOU HELP ME
I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT ON BREAK WILL YOU NOT INVITE ME WILL YOU NOT MAKE FUN OF ME WHEN I DON'T CAN WE FIND OTHER WAYS TO MEET OR INTERACT SO THAT YOU CAN HELP ME QUIT SMOKING
WEIGHTED ABOUT 280 POUNDS
SHE WAS EMBARRASSED SHE WOULD STRUGGLE AND STRUGGLE AND ALMOST GET HELPLESS BUT THEN SHE SAID NO
I'M GOING TO FIND THE REASONS WHY I REALLY WANT TO CHANGE
SHE WROTE IT ON A 3X5 CARD AND SHE DIDN'T COMMIT TO STICK TO HER DIET
STICK TO HER PLAN WHAT SHE SAID WAS BEFORE I BREAK MY PLAN I'M GOING TO THOUGHTFULLY AND SLOWLY READ MY CARD
THIS IS SHARMAN'S 3X5
CAN COME TO KNOW THAT IF WE WORK AT IT WE CAN CHANGE ANYTHING THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HER ENLIGHTENED MOMENT WAS WHEN SHE WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR IN THE HOSPITAL
SHE GOT CALL TO COME RESUSCITATE SOMEONE ON THE EIGHTH FLOOR IN ONE OF THOSE CODE BLUE
SHE CAN'T USE THE ELEVATOR SO SHE'S GOING UP THE STAIRS AND ON THE THIRD FLOOR
SHE HAS TO SIT BECAUSE SHE IS A SMOKER
SHE'S 5'3'' AND WEIGHS 213LB AND
SHE SITS THERE AS SHE SAYS GASPING FOR BREATH AND BURNING WITH SHAME
SHE SAID
I NEED TO QUIT SMOKING AND I NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT
AND WHEN SHE STARTED SAYING WHAT IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF MY CRUCIAL MOMENT
SHE HAD PLAN TO QUIT SMOKING
BUT THE SKILL SHE HAD TO LEARN WAS TO HAVE THE THOUGH CONVERSATION WITH HER DAD SHE SAID I'M DADDY'S GIRL BUT WHEN I GO AND VISIT WITH DAD I'M IN HIS HOUSE I'M WITH THE SMOKE HE OFFERS ME A CIGARETTE I SUCCUMBED EVERY TIME I HAD TO TALK TO HIM IT WAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST SKILLS
THAT I
WHEN I GO TO THE RANCH YOU LOOK AT THEIR SUCCESS RATE AND THERE'S NOT ACCOMPLICES IN THERE THERE'S NOT EXTRA CALORIES NOT FOOD THEY'VE MADE ALL THE THINGS EASY
SO I'M MOTIVATED AND ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT BEHAVIORS
BUT THAT'S NOT THE LESSON THERE IS A LESSON TO LEARN HERE BECAUSE I'VE
HAVE SUSTAINED IT FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AT LEAST TWO MAJOR DIFFERENCES CLEARLY THE ONES WHO SUCCEEDED
LIKE MANY OTHER CULTURES THAT WE ARE NOT VERY FAMILIAR OF
DEPEND THEIR LIFE ON THE SENSE OF SMELL
IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THEY GREET EACH OTHER WITH A GREETING LIKE THIS
INSTEAD OF SAYING SHORT HI OR HELLO LIKE WE DO
THE REPLIES TO THIS GREET
IS ALSO CONNECTED TO THE SENSE OF SMELL
WE CALL THAT CARD BACK AND READ AND MIMIC THE EMOTION
ARE SIMPLY BIOLOGICAL MATING SIGNALS
WE WERE HUNTERS ONCE BUT WE WERE ALSO THE HUNTED ONES AND WE LOOKED FOR FOOD BUT WE WERE ALSO FOOD FOR OTHER LIVING CREATURES AND WE HAD TO AVOID IT TALKING ABOUT FOOD I THINK WE ARE USING THE WORD
TO AVOID HARMFUL FOOD AND PICK THE NUTRITIOUS ONES WAS THE SENSE OF SMELL WE ARE NOT VERY AWARE OF IT WELL WE HAVE TWO HOLES IN OUR NOSES YOU KNOW
TO SMELL THE BASAL BODY ODOR OF OUR PARTNERS
MAYBE ONLY IN THE INTIMATE TIME WE SPEND WITH THEM
WE MIGHT GET SOME SLIGHT ODORIFEROUS SIGNALS BUT NEVER AT A CONSCIOUS LEVEL
SO
LET'S MAKE A CROSS CHECK
TO THIS BODY ODOR AND MATING RELATION
VERBALLY OF COURSE
WE MAY LOOK AT THE TIME WHEN OUR BODIES START TO EMIT A CHARACTERISTIC ODOR YOU KNOW BABIES AND CHILDREN SMELL DIFFERENT THAN THE ADOLESCENTS AND THE GROWN UPS
THE SWEAT PRODUCING GLANDS
START FUNCTIONING AT THE SAME TIME WHEN THE BODY HAIR STARTS TO FLOURISH
ESPECIALLY AT THE ARMPITS AND THE GENITALS
WHEN SWEAT MEETS THE BACTERIA SITTING ON THE HAIR
THEY GET INTO A REACTION WHICH PRODUCES
WHAT WE CALL THE SMELL OF SWEAT OR IN SHORT STINK
THEREFORE WE CAN SAY THAT EVERY TIME WE SMELL SOMETHING NEW FOR THE FIRST TIME
WE CREATE A VIRTUAL MEMORY CARD
AND PLACE IT IN OUR MEMORY DATABANK AND ON THAT CARD
WE TAKE THE NOTE OF THE EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION
OF THIS FIRST ENCOUNTER
LATER IN OUR LIVES WHEN WE SMELL THE SAME
A HANDFUL OF IDENTITIES SWEET SOUR
SALTY
BITTER AND UMAMI
WHAT IS IMPORTANT
FOR THE HUMAN IS
THE TOTAL FLAVOR
PERCEPTION AND TASTE IS JUST A SMALL PART OF IT IF WE DON'T GET THE SMELL OF WHAT WE EAT WE GET NO
MADE THIS SMALL EXPERIMENT
WE SAW THAT MOST IMPORTANTLY IDENTIFYING THE FOOD
THEREFORE FEED OURSELVES IN A LESS HARMFUL WAY
AND KEEP SURVIVING IS POSSIBLE ONLY WHEN THE SENSE OF SMELL IS ON THE MENU
AND NOW WE GO FOR ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THIS TRIPLE
I CAN CLOSE MY EYES AND YOU DON T WANT TO HEAR MY SPEECH YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EARS BUT IF WE DO NOT WANT TO SMELL WE CANNOT CLOSE OUR NOSES BECAUSE IF WE CLOSE OUR NOSES WE CANNOT BREATHE AND
DEPEND ON A TRIPLE CORE FOOD SHELTER AND REPRODUCTION EVERYTHING ELSE IS A SOCIAL SPHERE WE BUILD AROUND THIS CORE
NOW YOU CAN SAY THAT WHAT YOU ARE EATING IS NOT ONLY SWEET
BUT A SWEET PEACH FLAVORED JELLY BEAN
WHAT NOW YOU ARE EXPERIENCING IS THE FULL FLAVOR PERCEPTION
YOU ALSO CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THE SENSE OF SMELL
THE TASTE ALONE DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO
IT DEPENDS ON A GROUP OF GENES THAT REGULATE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
IT'S CALLED THE MHC MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX
AND TO HAVE A BIOLOGICALLY HEALTHY OFFSPRING
OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDMA
HAD TO FIND AND COPULATE WITH A GENTLEMAN
WHOSE IMMUNE SYSTEM WAS DIFFERENT THAN HERS
THIS ENABLED TWO DIFFERENT IMMUNE SYSTEMS TO COMBINE
AND GIVE A WAY TO A BABY WHO CARRIES THE ADVANTAGES OF BOTH
IN TERMS OF IMMUNITY OF COURSE
OTHERWISE THE UNFORTUNATE
OR BETTER YOU CAN JUST LET THE MAMA HUG THE BABY AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE BEHAVIOR
IF WE TAKE THIS TO HIGHER LEVEL
WE CAN ALSO SAY THAT THE SENSE OF SMELL IS A VITAL TOOL FOR THE HUMANKIND TO SURVIVE AND EXIST TILL TODAY
USING IT WHILE WE ARE TAKING OUR TIME IN THE PLACENTA LIQUID
IN OTHER WORDS WHEN WE ARE STILL ONE WITH OUR MOTHERS
HAVING SAID THIS WE ARE ALL SHARING ONE THING IN COMMON
THE FIRST DATA OF OUR MEMORY DATABANK IS THE SMELL OF OUR MOTHERS
THIS IS THE REASON
WHY A NEWBORN RELAXES AND PACIFIES
WHEN THE SMELL OF THE MOTHER
CAN BE FELT
SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW IN THE HOSPITALS OR IN THE
AFTER MAKING THIS SMALL CROSS CHECK
LET ME TAKE IT ALL FROM THE START ONCE MORE
FOR THE HUMAN RACE TO SURVIVE AND WALK THROUGH THE PASSAGES OF TIME
IT HAD TO BE ABLE TO FEED ITSELF
AND PRODUCE HEALTHY OFFSPRING
SO THE CHAIN WOULD GO ON
THESE TWO
{NS} {NS} DOESN'T MEAN MUCH TO YOU IT'S A GREETING WORD THAT THE ONGEES IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS USE WHEN THEY MEET EACH OTHER AND IT MEANS HOW
GRANDMAS OR GREAT GRANDDADS
SURVIVED
ALSO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHO I AM
WHO YOU ARE
HOW WE KEPT ON SURVIVING FOR A FEW MILLION YEARS
AND HOW WE CAN NOW ENJOY
THIS INSPIRING SERIES OF TEDX TALKS
I WISH YOU ALL TO KEEP YOUR NOSES OPEN AND IN THE MEANWHILE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND WISH YOU ALL FRAGRANT DAYS THANK YOU
HAD A FLU
AND YOUR NOSE WAS BLOCKED AND NO AIR WAS PASSING THROUGH
AND WHAT YOU ATE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN MUCH TO YOU
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A TASTE OF SMELL AND IT WAS A SMALL PART OF A GREATER SUM
SO WE SAY THAT 80 OF THE TOTAL FLAVOR PERCEPTION
IS ACTUALLY THE
OF THE SENSES THAT WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE OUTER WORLD AND I CAN SAY THAT IT HAS A PRIMARY IMPORTANCE THOUGH WE TEND TO NOT GIVE IMPORTANCE TO IT WE UNDERESTIMATE IT THE SMELLY
AND DON'T FORGET THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A FEW MILLION YEARS AGO SO THE ONLY EXPRESSION OF THIS GENOTYPE
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
OR THE PHENOTYPE OF THIS GENOTYPE
WAS THE BODY ODOR IN OTHER WORDS THE ONLY INDICATOR ABOUT A CORRECT BIOLOGICAL MATING PARTNER
WAS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE BODY ODOR AND THE ONLY WAY TO DETECT THIS WAS TO USE ABILITIES OF THE SENSE OF SMELL
LET ME REMIND YOU THAT THIS WAS A FEW MILLION YEARS AGO
AND THE SOCIAL SHELL WE BUILD AROUND THE BIO CORE
WAS
YOUR BIO IDENTITY CARD I CAN CALL IT AND WHAT DOES OUR UNIQUE
IS SOMETHING WE ESSENTIALLY NEED IN ORDER TO GO ON LIVING SO FOR THIS REASON WE BREATHE AROUND 20000 TIMES
RELATIVE MARRIAGES WERE INEVITABLE AND THE HUMAN RACE COULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED THIS LONG YOU CAN T
ANCESTORS I MEAN LIKE GREAT GREAT GRANDMA OR GREAT GRANDPAS THERE WERE NO SUPERMARKETS THERE
FOR THE BEGINNING YES AS YOU CAN GUESS FROM MY OPENING LINES WE ARE SMELLING BEINGS AND WE ARE SMELLY AS WELL OUR SENSE OF
TOOL THAT ALLOWS ANYONE TO COMBINE VIDEO WITH CONTENT PULLED LIVE DIRECTLY FROM THE WEB VIDEOS CREATED WITH POPCORN BEHAVE LIKE THE WEB ITSELF DYNAMIC FULL OF LINKS AND COMPLETELY REMIXABLE
ANY WEB SERVICE LIKE FLICKR OR ADD ARTICLES AND BLOG POSTS WITH LINKS OUT TO THE FULL CONTENT
HI AND WELCOME TO MY NEWSCAST I'VE ADDED MY LOCATION WITH GOOGLE MAP AND IT'S LIVE
REMIXABLE IT ALSO MEANS THERE'S NO PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE ALL YOU NEED IS A WEB BROWSER
LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE SOMETHING A BIT MORE RELEVANT TO TODAY NOW
PART OF THAT STORY THROUGH SIMPLE TOOLS THAT ALLOW US TO MAKE THINGS ONLINE
IN WORKSHOPS SO LET'S WATCH IT WE'LL GO BACK AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WE MADE IT
REMIXABLE LINKED TO ITS SOURCE CONTENT AND INTERACTIVE FOR EVERYONE WHO VIEWS IT I THINK POPCORN COULD CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE TELL STORIES ON THE WEB AND THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND THE WORLD WE LIVE
ALLOWED TO BREAK FREE FROM THE FRAME I WANT TO GIVE YOU A DEMO OF A PROTOTYPE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT WE'LL LAUNCH LATER THIS FALL IT WILL BE COMPLETELY FREE AND IT WILL WORK IN ANY BROWSER
BREAST CANCER AND COLON CANCER ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO OUR LACK OF
THINK ABOUT HOW TO REFRAME THOSE PROBLEMS AS HAVING BOTH THINGS BE TRUE BECAUSE IT WAS WHEN THAT HAPPENED WITH THIS WALK AND TALK IDEA
AND PROBABLY THE MORE REFLECTIVE ONE IS JUST ABOUT HOW MUCH EACH OF US CAN HOLD
YOUR LIFE AN ENTIRELY NEW SET OF IDEAS THANK YOU
THE TALK YOU'LL BE SURPRISED AT HOW FRESH AIR DRIVES FRESH THINKING AND IN THE WAY THAT YOU
THAT IT'S NOT OKAY IN THAT WAY SITTING HAS BECOME THE SMOKING OF OUR GENERATION
THINKING I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO ASK THE NEXT QUESTION BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO HUFF AND PUFF DURING THIS CONVERSATION AND YET I'VE
ANY OF THOSE STATS SHOULD CONVINCE EACH OF US TO GET OFF OUR DUFF MORE BUT IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME IT WON'T
BEHAVIOR IT'S DISCONNECTED FROM OUR DRUG USE
WE RARELY THINK ABOUT THESE DRUGS AS AN ENTIRE CATEGORY
INSTEAD WE TEND TO SPLIT THEM INTO TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRUGS WE THINK OF GOOD DRUGS AND BAD DRUGS OR WE THINK OF
ILLEGAL DRUGS AND LEGAL DRUGS CULTURAL HISTORIAN NANCY CAMPBELL SAYS THAT WE TEND TO THINK OF THEM AS PROBLEM SOLVING DRUGS AND PROBLEM CAUSING DRUGS
CAMPUS WITHIN TWO MINUTES YOU CAN HAVE RITALIN OR ADDERALL AND CAN SIT DOWN TO STUDY FOR YOUR EXAMS OR WRITE A PAPER IT'S A COMMON PRACTICE
WELL
THE FIRST SET OF USERS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN
BECAUSE THE PARENTS OF THOSE TEENAGERS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE FIGURED OUT THEY HAVE AN ACADEMIC EDGE IN FACT THEY NOW CALL
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO USE BAD DRUGS OR DO WE WHEN I TALK ABOUT DRUGS AND DESIRE PEOPLE MAKE TWO ASSUMPTIONS THEY ASSUME I'M TALKING
PROBLEM CAUSING THEY ARE CRIMINAL DANGEROUS ADDICTIVE THEY'RE NOT FOR MEDICAL USE IN FACT WE USE THEM TO AVOID REALITY OR TO ESCAPE
THAT BOTTLE OR BOTTLES OF WINE WITH YOUR FAMILY
OR YOU EAT HANDFUL OF MUSHROOMS TO GO OUT ON A HIKE
OR MAYBE
YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE THAT FIRST SECOND AND FIFTH CUP OF COFFEE IN THE MORNING
WE'RE ALL USERS
AND OUR PRACTICE REVEALS HOW WE WANT TO LIVE
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE SUBSTANCE AND THREE SETS OF
CAFFEINE NICOTINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND
ASSUME THAT IF YOU DESIRE SUBSTANCE YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR USE OF THAT SUBSTANCE FOR THE MAJORITY OF USERS OF
ADDICTION IS A REAL ISSUE AND MANY AMERICANS STRUGGLE WITH IT
BEING PUT ON THIS DRUG SAID WELL SHE WAS MISERABLE SO SHE WASN'T DOING HER SCHOOL WORK AND SHE WAS COMPLETELY SOCIALLY WITHDRAWN
NOW SHE'S HAPPY SHE'S EXCELLING AT HER SCHOOL WORK AND SHE'S SOCIALLY ACTIVE
WHY NOT
WHY NOT INDEED
OF THE 131 MILLION USERS OF ALCOHOL 11 BECOME ADDICTED HMM
SUBSTANCES IN THE UNITED STATES IT TURNS OUT THAT IS WRONG THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH
GETS IT SO ON THE SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE WHO ABSTAIN AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED ARE ALL THE OTHER USERS AND WHAT ARE THEY USING WELL OF THE PSYCHOACTIVE
AT LEAST ONE OF THESE SUBSTANCES RIGHT NOW OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY 51 MILLION PEOPLE ANOTHER 7 MILLION USE THEM WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF A PHYSICIAN
PHILOSOPHERS AND WRITERS HAVE OPENLY USED AMPHETAMINES AND HAVE EXTOLLED THEIR PURPOSE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THE COLLEGE KIDS THE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THE
AVAILABLE THE CAFFEINE YOU HAD THIS MORNING OR THE BEER YOU HAVE AT DINNER OR WE HAVE TO SEEK THEM THROUGH A PRESCRIPTION A PHYSICIAN'S CONSENT
ASK YOUR DOCTOR WE DO A LOT
IT'S COMMON
IT TURNS OUT
AND ASKING FOR THEIR
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN TO BE PUT ON THESE DRUGS NOT BECAUSE THEY EVIDENCE THE SYMPTOMS OF ADD BUT BECAUSE THEY WANT THAT PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT
SO I WONDER IF THESE PARENTS KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST PRESCRIBED DRUGS IS AN AMPHETAMINE
THESE SAME PARENTS WOULD BE HORRIFIED IF THEIR CHILDREN TURN TO METHAMPHETAMINE
BUT AS THE PARENT OF ONE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILD WHO HAD A DRAMATIC
WELL NOT JUST YOURS YOURS MINE
EVERYONE'S
IT'S AN AWKWARD SUBJECT IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVE VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT DRUGS
BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT
BECAUSE OUR THINKING ABOUT DRUGS IS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED
THE THIRD GROUP OF USERS ARE WRITERS AND THINKERS HISTORICALLY SOME OF OUR
SURVEY OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE
AND IN THAT SURVEY FOR JUST ILLICIT DRUG USERS THEY NOTE THAT 22 5 MILLION USERS
USE REGULARLY AND OF THEM AN AVERAGE OF 18 ARE ADDICTED TO WHATEVER SUBSTANCES THEY'RE USING BECAUSE IT'S A
EXPERIENCE DOES IT MATTER IF WE ALL USE BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE
AND FEEL INTOXICATED
AT THE BEGINNING
FOR OVER 40 YEARS THE UNITED STATES HAS WAGED A DEVASTATING DRUG WAR
IN THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME WE'VE EXPERIENCED AN UNPRECEDENTED BOOM IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
THE RESULT OF THESE TWO TRENDS IS THAT ON THE ONE HAND WE'VE INCARCERATED MILLIONS OF DRUG USERS WHILE BECOMING THE MOST MEDICATED PEOPLE IN AMERICAN HISTORY
HOW DID WE GET TO THIS CONFLICTED PLACE ABOUT DRUG USE AND IS IT WHERE WE WANT TO BE
LET'S SAY FOR THE SAKE OF CONVERSATION NO IT'S NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE
THE THING IS WE CAN CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR AND OUR APPROACH TO DRUGS IF WE ALL CHANGE OUR THINKING ABOUT DRUGS AND THE DESIRE TO USE THEM
SO I HAVE TO ASK CAN MILLIONS OF HAPPY
TWO THINGS
THE FIRST IS
WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS SUBJECT PEOPLE OFTEN REACT RIGHT ABOUT NOW AND THE REASON IS THAT YOU PROBABLY KNOW SOMEBODY WHO STRUGGLES WITH ADDICTION
I DO
AND I HAVE COMPASSION FOR THAT SUFFERING
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT IF 15 30 OF THE USERS OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS
BECOME ADDICTED THAT MEANS THAT 70 85 OF THE USERS DON'T
THAT MEANS
THAT 70 85 OF USERS OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS ARE CONTROLLED USERS
IT'S ALMOST HARD TO BELIEVE BECAUSE WE NEVER HEAR THAT INSTEAD WE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED WHICH IS A VERY TINY SUBSET OF VERY TINY SUBSET
TO USE THEM THEY HELP REFINE FOCUS THEY HELP YOU FOCUS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME
SO WRITERS LIKE W H AUDEN OR GRAHAM GREENE OR THINKERS LIKE JEAN PAUL SARTRE ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR AMPHETAMINE USE
LOTS OF WRITERS USE THEM INCLUDING THIS WRITER
WHEN PEOPLE COME AND TELL ME ABOUT THE PROPAGANDA THEY'VE HEARD ABOUT METHAMPHETAMINE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLEARLY NEVER TRIED THE DRUG I SOMETIMES WILL SAY
I WROTE MY DISSERTATION IN NINE MONTHS WITH THE OCCASIONAL HELP OF METHAMPHETAMINE
IT WAS A REALLY FUNCTIONAL DRUG IT WORKED FOR ME
SO HERE'S MY QUESTION
DOES IT MATTER IF I'M A CONTROLLED USER DOES IT MATTER IF I USE TO GET MY WORK DONE
IF I USE TO FEEL GOOD
DOES IT MATTER IF YOU USE TO AVOID FEELING BAD
OR YOUR FRIEND USES TO HAVE AN
I'LL TALK ABOUT ARE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES IF COLLEGE STUDENTS FIGURED THIS OUT YOU KNOW THAT PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IS A GOOD THING
AND SOME LEAGUES HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOW THE USE OF THIS DRUG WITH THE PRESCRIPTION OF DOCTOR
SUDDENLY ACROSS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL EVERY OTHER PLAYER HAS ADD
IT'S
THE USERS OF ALL PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS USE THOSE ILLEGAL DRUGS ANOTHER 15 7 USE PHARMACEUTICALS NON
IN FACT WE CELEBRATE THE USE OF ALCOHOL WE SERVE IT AT OUR SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE GIVE IT AS GIFTS TO FAMILY AND COMPLETE STRANGERS AND
WE EXPECT IT TO BE AT MOST OF OUR MEALS
IN OTHER WORDS ALCOHOL IS A PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG WHOSE USE HAS BECOME NORMATIVE FOR MOST AMERICANS
IT'S A GOOD DRUG
BAD DRUGS
LET'S DO A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT CLOSE YOUR EYES
YOUR TEACHERS YOUR MENTORS YOUR FRIENDS YOUR NEIGHBORS
CULTURAL NORMS ARE LEARNED
WE CREATE THEM
AND WE CAN CHANGE THEM
I'LL DRINK TO THAT
ALL THE VARIOUS TASKS THAT THESE CEOS ENGAGED IN AND HOW MUCH TIME THEY SPENT ENGAGING IN MAKING DECISIONS RELATED TO THESE
TO LOVE GOING TO THIS STORE BUT ON ONE OCCASION I ASKED MYSELF WELL HOW COME YOU NEVER BUY ANYTHING HERE'S THEIR OLIVE OIL
TO HELP YOU MANAGE YOUR CHOICES BETTER FOR YOU YOU CAN USE THEM ON YOURSELF BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE
PRODUCTS BUT THE NINTH LARGEST RETAILER THE NINTH BIGGEST RETAILER IN THE WORLD
SIMPLE TECHNIQUES
TECHNIQUES THAT WE HAVE TESTED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN DIFFERENT RESEARCH VENUES
THAT YOU CAN EASILY APPLY IN YOUR BUSINESSES
THE FIRST
CUT
YOU'VE HEARD IT SAID BEFORE BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE TRUE THAN TODAY THAT LESS IS MORE
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS UPSET WHEN I SAY CUT
THEY'RE ALWAYS WORRIED THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE SHELF SPACE BUT IN FACT WHAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE IS THAT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO CUT GET RID OF THOSE EXTRANEOUS REDUNDANT
PREPARES ME FOR HOW TO CHOOSE IT ALSO GETS ME EXCITED ABOUT THIS BIG PRODUCT THAT I'M PUTTING TOGETHER SO I'M MORE WILLING TO BE MOTIVATED TO BE
TO GO TO THIS VERY VERY UPSCALE GROCERY STORE AT LEAST AT THAT TIME IT WAS TRULY UPSCALE IT WAS A STORE CALLED
EVERY SINGLE HARVARD EMPLOYEE IS NOW AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED IN A LIFECYCLE
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WILLING TO SAVE OR THE AMOUNT THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO PUT DOWN INTO THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNT BY FOUR PERCENT THE THIRD TECHNIQUE
TO 30 PERCENT MORE WHEN THEY USE AN ATM CARD OR A CREDIT CARD AS OPPOSED TO CASH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE REAL MONEY
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT MAKING IT FEEL MORE CONCRETE CAN ACTUALLY BE A VERY POSITIVE TOOL TO USE IN GETTING PEOPLE TO SAVE MORE SO A STUDY THAT I DID WITH SHLOMO BENARTZI AND ALESSANDRO PREVITERO WE DID A
STUDY WITH PEOPLE AT ING EMPLOYEES THAT ARE ALL WORKING AT
STARTED OUR SESSION THIS AFTERNOON I HAD CHAT WITH GARY AND GARY SAID THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO OFFER PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE AN ALL EXPENSES PAID FREE VACATION TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROAD IN THE
SEE THAT PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THOSE LONG LISTS OF ALL THESE FUNDS WHO ARE THEY ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE INFORMING
MY FOURTH TECHNIQUE CONDITION FOR COMPLEXITY
IT TURNS OUT WE CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE A LOT MORE INFORMATION THAN WE THINK WE CAN WE'VE JUST GOT TO TAKE IT LITTLE
OUR WAISTLINES BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM AFFECTS US EVEN IN VERY CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS WE CHOOSE NOT TO CHOOSE EVEN WHEN IT GOES AGAINST OUR BEST SELF INTERESTS
SO NOW FOR THE TOPIC OF TODAY FINANCIAL SAVINGS
NOW I'M
GOING TO DESCRIBE TO YOU A STUDY I DID WITH GUR HUBERMAN EMIR KAMENICA WEI JANG
WHERE WE LOOKED AT THE RETIREMENT SAVINGS DECISIONS
OF NEARLY A MILLION AMERICANS
FROM ABOUT 650 PLANS
ALL IN THE U
TO DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT AND WE PICKED JAM FOR OUR
IN A TYPICAL DAY THERE WAS ALSO RECENTLY A STUDY DONE WITH CEOS IN WHICH THEY FOLLOWED CEOS AROUND FOR A WHOLE WEEK AND THESE SCIENTISTS SIMPLY
IN FACT YOU HAD OBJECTIVELY MORE INFORMATION THE FIRST TIME AROUND THAN THE SECOND TIME AROUND BUT I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS THAT YOU FELT THAT IT WAS MORE REAL THE SECOND TIME AROUND
BECAUSE THE PICTURES MADE IT FEEL MORE REAL TO YOU
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR HANDLING THE CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM WHICH IS
READY TO HEAR ABOUT THE CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM
CHOICE TO LOW CHOICE THEY'RE HITTING THAT DEFAULT BUTTON OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE'RE LOSING THEM THEY GO FROM LOW CHOICE TO HIGH CHOICE THEY'RE HANGING IN
AISLES RANGE ANYWHERE FROM 331 DIFFERENT KINDS OF MAGAZINES ALL THE WAY UP TO
COLORS EXTERIOR CAR COLORS I'VE GOT 56 CHOICES ENGINES GEARSHIFT FOUR CHOICES SO NOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO VARY THE ORDER IN WHICH THESE DECISIONS
OF DECISIONS THAT ANY OF US WOULD RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE CONSIDERING THEIR FUTURE FINANCIAL WELL BEING
PERCENT OF THEIR DECISIONS WERE MADE IN NINE MINUTES OR LESS
ONLY ABOUT 12 PERCENT OF THE DECISIONS DID THEY MAKE
AN HOUR OR MORE OF THEIR TIME
THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN CHOICES
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHOICES MAKE IT INTO YOUR NINE MINUTE CATEGORY VERSUS YOUR ONE HOUR CATEGORY
HOW WELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING AT MANAGING THOSE CHOICES
TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST MODERN DAY CHOOSING PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS THE CHOICE OVERLOAD PROBLEM
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS
NOW AS I TALK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND I'M GOING TO WANT TO KNOW YOUR
SHE HAD JUST LAUNCHED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED WOMEN JOURNALISTS WITHOUT CHAINS
AND SHE WANTED TO PARTNER WITH OUR ORGANIZATION BRIDGES
IT WAS A BIT OF A STARTLING EXPERIENCE COULD WE COLLABORATE WITH WOMEN JOURNALISTS WITHOUT CHAINS AND NOT GET CO OPTED INTO ADVOCACY WE DID CAPACITY BUILDING
TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING HEALTHCARE IN PLACE LIKE VIETNAM OR
WORK ANYMORE AND I KNOW IT'S REALLY HARD TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER AND HOW WE RELATE TO THE
THAT ABORIGINAL YOUTH WHO LIVE OFF RESERVE CAN BE SEEN AS
AND WHY BRIDGES VOLUNTEERS DO THIS WORK BUT
LET'S THINK ABOUT THE WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE DO NOW RIGHT NOW WE FOCUS ON TOP DOWN WE DO
THEY DEAL WITH DRUGS AND VIOLENCE AND GANGS AND
OF ISLAM IN THAT COUNTRY AND YET SHE WAS ADVOCATING FOR GENDER EQUALITY AND FREEDOM OF THE
ABORIGINAL YOUTH RIGHT HERE IN ALBERTA
IN THE FUTURE TO BE EFFECTIVE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THE GRASS ROOTS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET TO KNOW THESE YOUNG PEOPLE NOT JUST
OUR WEBSITE DOWNLOAD IT AND TAKE IT AND PLEASE USE IT AND THE THIRD THING WE DID WAS SET UP A YOUTH SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL PROGRAM
AND HE ALWAYS SUPPORTED ME IN MY
THAN ME TITLE IX IS ABOUT EDUCATIONAL EQUITY FOR BOYS AND FOR GIRLS AND MEN AND WOMEN TITLE IX BLEW THE SOCKS OFF OF EDUCATION FOR WOMEN IT
ANTIQUATED SO WHAT IF WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT SYSTEMS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN BUT ACTUALLY GAVE EQUAL PRIORITY
TO THOSE DIFFERENCES WOULDN'T THAT BE
A DIFFERENT KIND
OF EQUITY
NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL
IN 1999
CITY PLANNERS IN
IS STILL AN INHERENT BIAS AGAINST WOMEN LEADERS AND INTERESTINGLY ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY OUTPERFORMING MEN IN SOME CASES BUT THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING THE TITLES
ARE IN THE BOARD ROOM OR IN THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP SUITE THAT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENTS IS HIGHER SALES ARE INCREASED AND GENERALLY ORGANIZATIONS ARE LIFTED
TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A 2013 STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT AFTER NATURAL
IN THAT YEAR IN WASHINGTON DC SOMETHING CALLED TITLE IX WAS
THAT MATCH THAT PERFORMANCE THAT'S
AND WE CAN SKYPE AND WE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT IN 2014 WORK STILL FOR THE MOST PART IS A DERIVATIVE OF A 19TH CENTURY FACTORY MODEL
FOOTPATHS THEY TOOK LARGE EXPANSE OF SPACES AND THEY ACTUALLY MADE LITTLE POCKETS THEY MADE BADMINTON COURTS AND
BECAUSE WHEN BOYS HEAR LEADERSHIP THEY'RE CALLED LEADERS AND WHEN GIRLS HEAR LEADERSHIP THEY'RE CALLED BOSSY AND THEY'RE LEAVING WHEN
MAYBE WE ARE JUST NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH I
THEY FOUND INADVERTENTLY WAS THAT WOMEN ACTUALLY WERE CARRYING MORE AMBIEN IN THEIR BODIES
HERE WE ARE 2014 I AM A DEAN OF COLORADO WOMEN'S COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DENVER I AM RIGHT THERE GETTING THIS EQUATION
MEN MY CALL TO ACTION TODAY IS TO BREAK THE
SO MY DAD WAS RIGHT I DID BECOME AN ICE
THAT THEY DECIDED TO ACTUALLY DO CITY PLANNING BASED ON GENDER DIFFERENCE
AND SO WHAT DID THEY DO
IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
THEY TOOK
SIDEWALKS AND WIDEN THEM
THEY GAVE GREATER LIGHTING TO STREETS THEY BUILT RAMPS THAT ACCOMMODATED STROLLERS AND WHEELCHAIRS
DAY WE WERE HAVING CONVERSATION AND HE SAID TO ME WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP AND I THOUGHT IT'S THE 1960S WHAT
WOULD SAY BRINGING WOMEN INTO SPACES
WHERE THEY DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE OR THEY HAD NO RIGHT
TO EXIST
ISN'T THAT A LOVELY STATEMENT
THIS IS FROM THE CITY PLANNER
SO I SAY TO YOU TODAY THIS IS
AM NOT A NICE GIRL WILL YOU STILL LIKE ME
BE A VIENNESE PLAYGROUND {LG} I WANT US TO LOOK AT OUT SYSTEMS I WANT US TO CONSIDER WHY GIRLS AND WOMEN ARE OPTING
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT I THOUGHT
AROUND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN FACT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN HAS GROWN SO MUCH THAT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS CALLED THIS A WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC
FIT IN THESE SYSTEMS {NS} {NS} AND SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT LEANING IN AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT NO HAVING CONFIDENCE AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT GETTING THE CORNER OFFICE BECAUSE FOR MOST
AND THE GIRLS CAME BACK AND THE BOYS STAYED AND EVERYONE WON
IT IS NOT AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WAS 45 MORE AMBIEN FOUND IN WOMEN THAN THERE WERE IN
I AM NOT SURE THAT EQUATION IS
I'VE MADE THE GIRLS' SOFTBALL TEAM AND I AM ALL EXCITED BECAUSE I AM
ONE MEMORY THAT REALLY STICKS OUT TO ME
IS
WHEN I WAS ABOUT SIX YEARS OLD
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY IN MY FIRST GRADE CLASS WHO HAD GOTTEN A TAP DANCING SOLO
AND HE WAS VERY EXCITED TO TELL THE REST OF OUR CLASSMATES
OR CISGENDER MEANING NOT IDENTIFYING AS THE GENDER
AND THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT
OFTEN THEY GET BRUSHED UNDER THE RUG
AND THEY DON'T COME OUT UNTIL THEY'RE MUCH OLDER
OR
THEY COME OUT IN THE PUBLIC EYE
AND AUTHORITY FIGURES DO NOT RESPECT THEIR IDENTITY
THEIR AUTHENTICITY IS OFTEN QUESTIONED AND DOUBTED
AND FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO HEAR THAT FROM AN AUTHORITY FIGURE A PARENT
A RELATIVE OR EVEN STRANGER ON THE STREET
IT MAKES YOU THINK
WELL IF THEY DON'T RESPECT THIS FAMOUS PERSON'S IDENTITY
HOW CAN THEY RESPECT MINE
IN CELEBRITY CULTURE YOU HAVE THESE STORIES OF THESE OLDER CELEBRITIES
BUT A LOT OF THEIR COMING OUT STORIES ARE FROM 20 YEARS AGO
SO THEY'RE NOT EXPERIENCING IT NOW
AND THEIR EXPERIENCE MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE TIME THAT THEY LIVED IN
WHEREAS QUEER YOUTH LITERATURE IN
A BOOK THE CHARACTER NEVER AGES
HARRY POTTER WAS ALWAYS 14 IN GOBLET OF FIRE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE 14 FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS
AND ALL OF THIS READING INSPIRED ME TO WANT TO BECOME A WRITER FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE
AND AS A WRITER I FOCUSED MOSTLY ON QUEER YOUTH NARRATIVE I'M
GOING TO BREAK THIS DOWN QUEER MEANING
PEOPLE CHARACTERS OR VOICES THAT DON'T IDENTIFY AS HETEROSEXUAL
AND
THE AGE THING AND THE EXPERIENCE
EXPERIENCE AND HAVING THEM COINCIDE HAVING SOMEONE AROUND YOUR AGE EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING YOU ARE
YOU CAN CONNECT
THEY CAN BE INSPIRED
BY THE STORIES OF
NEIL PATRICK HARRIS AND ELLEN DEGENERES
BUT THEY CAN'T CONNECT
AND IT'S A NECESSITY TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT
SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR LIVES AND FEEL AS IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING THEY ARE
I DECIDED TO BECOME A WRITER AT VERY YOUNG AGE I WAS ABOUT 13
ALL OF WENDY'S POEMS WHILE THEY'RE ALL LEFT HAND JUSTIFIED AS WE MAY BE USED TO
ALL OF HER POEMS ARE A LITTLE MORE CHAOTIC
THERE ARE NO FORM POEMS
AND MOST OTHER POEMS LACK
PUNCTUATION
BECAUSE HER EXPERIENCE UNLIKE PETER'S IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CHAOTIC
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE DISASTROUS
AND AS I WAS WRITING THIS PROJECT
I BROUGHT SOME POEMS TO MY PROFESSOR TO REVIEW THEM
AND SHE SAID TO ME AND MY CLASSMATES
THERE AREN'T MANY VOICES LIKE THIS OUT THERE
AND THIS REALLY NEEDS TO TURN INTO SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER
AND IT DID
AND WHILE I WAS WRITING IT
I FELT THIS EXCITEMENT
ABOUT WRITING IT AND BEING CLOSED TO FINISHING IT
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I FELT THIS
FRUSTRATION AND ANGER
AND I WAS VERY UPSET
BECAUSE
IT'S NOT THAT THERE WASN'T A LACK OF QUEER VOICES IT'S JUST THAT THEY WEREN'T TALKED ABOUT
THEY WEREN'T ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY THEY WEREN'T
RESPECTED
AND THE REASON I STARTED WRITING IT WAS TO CREATE THIS UNDERSTANDING
FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE STRUGGLES OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY
TO BE ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHIZE WITH THESE CHARACTERS
SO I PLAYED A LOT WITH VISUAL FORM AND LANGUAGE
ALL OF PETER'S POEMS
ARE RIGHT HAND JUSTIFIED
ALL OF HIS
AND
MANY OF YOU
ARE PROBABLY NOT USED TO READING ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE PAGE AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
THAT DISCOMFORT IS TO MIMIC THE SENSE OF DISCOMFORT THAT HE FEELS WITHIN HIMSELF THROUGH MUCH OF HIS LIFE
AND AT THE TIME I WAS STILL READING A LOT
AND
I READ MIXTURE OF VOICES QUEER VOICES NON QUEER VOICES AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
TYPES OF VOICES
AND
DECIDING TO BE A WRITER AT A VERY YOUNG AGE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A VERY DIFFICULT TIME
AND THESE BOOKS WERE HELPING ME GET THOUGH QUESTIONING MY IDENTITY
AND DISCOVERING WHO I WAS AS A YOUNG PERSON
IN MY MORE FORMATIVE YEARS
GROCERY SHOPPING
HIS HANDS CORRODE THE WHEEL WITH THE SWEAT OF ANCIENT SUMMERS
I CAN'T TELL IF THE SLICK WATER LINES ARE RIVERS LEADING FROM HIS TEMPLES OR JUST UNDER HIS EYES
WE PUT AWAY THE ORANGES THE BANANAS THE WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
AND HE WRINGS A DISHRAG BETWEEN HIS WRISTS AND THUMBS
MOURNING A CONVERSATION THAT'S JUST AT THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
A LOT OF US USE READING TO ESCAPE OUR REALITY I DID I'M SURE MANY OF YOU DID AS WELL AND THERE'S ANOTHER FORM OF
MY WRITING I FOCUS ON THE AGES BETWEEN 11 AND 10 AS YOUNG AS THAT OR AS OLD AS 25 AND 26 AND WE ALL KNOW THAT READING IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FORM OF ESCAPISM
SHELTER
HE BUILT A HOUSE AROUND HIM MADE OF STICKS AND WOOD AND A SHEET FROM THE HALL CLOSET THAT MOTHER TOLD HIM NO AND HE WENT TO GRAB ONE FROM THE DRYER AND HIS BROTHER SAID MOM WILL KILL YOU AND PETER SAID GOOD LET HER BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT PETER IS HE WAS NEVER AFRAID
HE BUILT A HOUSE AROUND HIM MADE OF CARDBOARD AND WOOD FROM THE GARAGE AND HIS FATHER NEVER BLEW IT DOWN EVEN THOUGH IT SHIVERED WHEN PETER CRAWLED OUT OF IT AND SAID LOOK DAD LOOK WHAT I MADE AND
HIS FATHER GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND SAID SON YOU CAN'T FIT YOUR LIFE INTO TINY BOXES
WHICH IS WHY I STARTED WRITING PETER AND THE CONCRETE JUNGLE
PETER AND THE CONCRETE JUNGLE IS A PROJECT THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS
AND IT'S A COLLECTION OF POETRY DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS
THE FIRST HALF ARE ALL THIRD PERSON POEMS ABOUT PETER
A TRANS MAN AND
HIS EXPERIENCE THROUGH HIS CHILDHOOD AND HIS TRANSITION
AND HIS ADULTHOOD
AND THE SECOND HALF IS ABOUT WENDY
A YOUNG QUEER WOMAN
THROUGH HER CHILDHOOD AND HER EXPERIENCE COMING OUT
AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER
BOTH OF MY PARENTS WERE ARTISTS
AND YOU COULD VERY MUCH SAY THAT I WAS NOT A CHILD WHO FIT INTO ANY SENSE OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE NORM
SO NEEDLESS TO SAY I GOT MADE FUN OF
A LOT
AND I DIDN'T HAVE VERY MANY FRIENDS
BUT
IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THAT I READ A LOT
AND I BECAME FRIENDS WITH CHARACTERS IN BOOKS
I BECAME FRIENDS WITH HERMIONE GRANGER AND JUNIE B JONES
AND MANY MORE
TO EACH OTHER TO CHARACTERS IN BOOKS FROM OUR CHILDHOOD
TO CHARACTERS IN BOOKS WE MAY HAVE READ LAST WEEK
AND MAYBE IF WE LISTEN TO THESE CONNECTIONS
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A NECESSITY TO HAVE THIS VARIATION OF VOICES AND THAT ALL OF THESE VOICES SHOULD BE RESPECTED AND LISTENED TO
BECAUSE
THESE VOICES ALL GIVE US THE SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING
OF LONGING OF HOPE THAT WE NEED TO KEEP GOING
AS PEOPLE
AND
SHOULD
WE LISTEN TO THESE VOICES
MAYBE WE COULD CHANGE AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON EACH OTHER
AND ON THE WORLD
BUT ONLY IF WE PICK UP THE BOOK AND LISTEN TO THE VOICE LONG ENOUGH
IN THE TIME THAT WE LIVE IN WHICH IS CELEBRITY CULTURE
YOU KNOW AND WE LIVE IN A TIME WHERE WE CAN GO ONLINE AND FIND OUT ANYTHING WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ANY SINGER ACTOR ENTERTAINER IN A MATTER OF SECONDS
AND IT'S WONDERFUL
THAT WE HAVE
OUT QUEER CELEBRITIES WHO ARE ACTIVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
WE HAVE NEIL PATRICK HARRIS WE HAVE ELLEN DEGENERES
WE ARE ALSO LUCKILY LIVE IN A TIME WHERE WE HAVE QUEER CHARACTERS ON TELEVISION
WE HAVE MITCH AND CAM FROM MODERN FAMILY
CALLIE AND ARIZONA FROM GREY'S ANATOMY
AND BOTH LISTS CONTINUE TO GO ON
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QUEER YOUTH NARRATIVE
AND CELEBRITY CULTURE
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE
AND THE REST OF THE KIDS IN MY CLASS UNFORTUNATELY STARTED MAKING FUN OF HIM
SO LITTLE SIX YEAR OLD ME
WITH ALL THE VOICE I CAN MUSTER
STOMPED HER FOOT AND SAID HEY TAP DANCING BOYS ARE COOL
AND WHAT STICKS OUT ABOUT THIS MEMORY ISN'T THE FACT THAT I THOUGHT TAP DANCING BOYS WERE COOL
BUT IT WAS THE FACT THAT I WAS A VERY TIMID CHILD
AND I COULDN'T EVEN STAND UP FOR MY OWN SELF
YET HERE I WAS STANDING UP FOR SOME OTHER BOY IN MY CLASS
JUST HAD 1 5 MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE
I'M NOT THE MOST SEASONED ENTREPRENEUR OUT THERE BUT I DO WANNA SHARE THREE KEY PIECES OF ADVICE THAT HAVE HELPED ME SUCCEED AS A COLLEGE ENTREPRENEUR
THE NUMBER ONE THING TO STARTING ANY BUSINESS IS TO FIND THE PROBLEM
MIGHT SOUND EASIER THAN IT IS
BUT FINDING A PROBLEM IS THE KEY INGREDIENT TO STARTING ANY BUSINESS
NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER HOW DO I FIND A PROBLEM
WELL START WITH YOURSELF START WITH YOUR HOBBIES AND THE THINGS YOU LIKE TO DO DO
YOU LIKE TRAVELLING DO YOU LIKE SPORTS DO YOU LIKE VIDEO GAMES EITHER ONE OF THESE THINGS THERE IS BUNCH OF CHALLENGES THAT SURROUND THAT PARTICULAR HOBBY
THAT MIGHT BE WAITING FOR
ME TO THE MY THIRD PIECE OF ADVICE WHICH IS TO BOOTSTRAP
BOOTSTRAPING BASICALLY MEANS DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THINGS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED
IT'S REALLY EASY TO SPEND MONEY BUT IT'S A LOT HARDER TO MAKE THEM
WHEN YOU ARE IN SCHOOL YOU ARE IN THE LEARNING PHASE
YOU SHOULD REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO YOU ON THE INTERNET
AT THAT POINT I KNEW THERE IS NO GOING BACK
I JOINED THE FAU TECH RUNWAY ACCELERATED PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO HELP YOUNG COMPANIES AND YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ME
TO SUCCEED IN THEIR BUSINESS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE FOR ME THEY HAVE PROVIDED ME WITH CAPITAL SPACE
AND A BUNCH OF OTHER GREY HAIRED MENTORS TO HELP ME GET MY BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL
SOMEHOW STUCK WITH ME UNTIL THIS DAY AND
IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS
BEFORE I MOVED TO THE US I HEARD THAT THE STREETS ARE PAVED WITH GOLD
WHEN I GOT HERE I FOUND OUT THREE THINGS
FIRST THE STREETS WERE NOT PAVED WITH GOLD
SECOND THE STREETS WERE NOT PAVED AT ALL
AND THIRD I WAS EXPECTED TO PAVE THEM
THE
REASON WHY THAT QUOTE RESONATES WITH ME SO MUCH IS BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME HOW DIFFICULT A LIFE CAN BE WHEN YOU MOVE INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITHOUT SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE HAVING ANY FRIENDS OR KNOWING THEIR CULTURE
WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD I HAD A HUGE DREAM OF MOVING INTO THE US FINISH THE SCHOOL AND START A BUSINESS AND
NOW I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT I FINALLY FULFILLED MY DREAM OF STARTING A BUSINESS AS I'VE RUN MY BUSINESS FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND NOW EMPLOYED 15
IT OR I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM A POST COMMUNIST COUNTRY YOU GET NOTHING FOR FREE AND WHEN YOU DO THERE IS USUALLY A CATCH
WELL THERE WASN'T A CATCH THIS TIME I MET MY FIRST MENTOR BOB MILLSON
A GREY HAIRED SEVENTY YEAR OLD DUDE WHO HAS BEEN THERE HE HAS DONE IT HE SOLD AND EXITED HIS BUSINESS
AND HE WAS THERE FOR ME HE HAS HELPED ME TO WRITE A KILLER PRESENTATION A BUSINESS PLAN
AND HELPED ME WIN THE FIRST PLACE AT THE FAU BUSINESS PLAN COMPETITION
BEFORE I KNEW IT I WAS APPROACHED BY THE FAU TO REPRESENT THEM AT THE STATE WIDE COLLEGIAL
MYSELF
TO GET THEIR BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL
FOR FREE
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CATCH THAT'S THE THING I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW SOMEBODY WOULD VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME FOR FREE AND NOT WANT ANYTHING FOR IT
THE REASON WHY I
FULL OF JOCKS NOPE NOBODY TEACHES US TO TELL THOSE TRUTHS
AT A MEETING OF OUR NATIONAL CHURCH LEADERS DECLARING HOMOSEXUALITY WAS A MANIFESTATION OF A DEPRAVED NATURE A PERVASION OF DIVINE STANDARDS AND AN ABOMINATION
FAITH AND EARTHLY LOVE IT'S TO BEG GOD TO CHANGE YOU HOPING FOR A GOLDEN TICKET INTO STRAIGHTNESS
AND SO I MADE MY WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE WITH NO DATING JUST DENIAL I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT MY FAITH HOPING TO ONE DAY DISCOVER A TONIC OF SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINES THAT WOULD CURE ME
AND IN THE MEANTIME I PERFECTED THE ART OF NUMBING THE PAIN WORK WORK
IS TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE WELCOME ONLY IF YOU REMAIN SINGLE AND CELIBATE IT'S TO FEEL FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE I WENT TO CHURCH WITH SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET BUT IN 1988 A RESOLUTION WAS
OUT BIG VACATIONS AND THE CONTINUAL INCANTATION I DON'T NEED LOVE I DON'T NEED LOVE I DON'T NEED LOVE
FORGET COPING MECHANISMS I HAD BUILT A COPING MACHINE
AND IT WORKED
UNTIL IT DIDN'T
SOME TIME AROUND 30
OF TELLING MY TRUTH SOMETHING I WISH I'D DONE SO MUCH SOONER
REACTIONS WITH PEOPLE FREAKING OUT AND CASTING JUDGMENT BUT EACH TIME
UP
AND REALIZED ALL OF MY FRIENDS HAD MOVED ON WITH THEIR LIVES MATRICULATING INTO THE WORLD OF WEDDING DRESSES AND CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY PARTIES
MY LONELINESS GREW AND AS THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS BEGAN TO ADD UP
I EVENTUALLY GAVE UP
I DECIDED TO STOP HIDING
AND THROUGH ONE
THEOLOGY BEFORE EMPATHY
WE'VE PROTECTED A TABU THAT QUIETLY BOILS KIDS IN THEIR OWN SHAME
WE HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM THE SPACE AND THE GRACE THAT WE GIVE EVERYONE ELSE AND WE'VE DEFENDED DISEMBODIED SPIRITUAL DOCTRINES WHILE MISSING THE ACTUAL BODIES IN OUR PEWS
KIDS IN OUR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES DARE NOT SPEAK THEIR TRUTH
OUT OF FEAR
MANY OF THEM ARE STRUGGLING ALONE AND WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION WHY IS THE WORD H E L P SO HARD FOR THEM
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT I SEE FAITH LEADERS RISING UP CHANGING THE CONVERSATION I SEE OUR CHURCHES PIVOTING AS THEY
TO BE A GAY PERSON OF FAITH IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH IS ITS OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGE
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE 80S AND 90S AND THOSE STRONG WORDS DID NOT GO UNNOTICED BY LITTLE EARS IN THE
LITTLE RIVER TOWN OF BAPTISTS AND ARTISTS MOSTLY BAPTISTS FLORENCE IS QUINTESSENTIALLY SOUTHERN AND GROWING UP THERE IS SUNDAY LUNCHES AFTER CHURCH LITTLE LEAGUE
I BEGAN TO COME OUT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY MOST OF WHOM WERE VERY RELIGIOUS THE CONVERSATIONS WERE TOUGH AT FIRST RED WINE WAS MY COURAGE PEPTO BISMOL WAS MY PEACE {LG} FOR YEARS I HAD IMAGINED THE
BUT TELLING IT WAS NOT AN OPTION THE GOOD OLD BOY GHOST OF SOUTHERN CULTURE WAS CLEAR ZIP IT UP LOCK IT DOWN WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT DOWN HERE PREACHER BOY I LOVE MY
I SEE PEOPLE OF FAITH LEARNING A SACRED SONG THAT KEEPS RHYTHM WITH ORTHODOXY WHILE SHOUTING A CHORUS OF LOVE AND I SEE BELIEVERS UNITED
REMINDING EVERY CHILD
YOU ARE LOVED AND
YOU ARE LOVELY AND YOUR FUTURE IS INCREDIBLY BRIGHT THANK YOU
THANKS THANK YOU
FOLK OF THE SOUTH ARE FUELED BY HATE
BUT I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE I KNOW THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE WILDLY GENEROUS AND KIND BEYOND BELIEF FOR CENTURIES THEY HAVE BEEN THE ONES HELPING THE POOR IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND PROVIDING RELIEF AFTER DISASTERS
WE NEED OUR FAITH COMMUNITIES AND OUTSIDERS TYPECASTING THEM AS BIGOTS ARE PEDDLING THE FALLACY OF COMPOSITION VOCAL ZEALOTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE BENEVOLENT MAJORITY
I DON'T THINK OUR FAITH COMMUNITIES HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HATE
I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LOVE
WE JUST HAVEN'T LOVED OUR LGBT
ACROSS THE CENTURIES TOWARDS LOVE I SEE THE RHETORIC BEING REPLACED WITH A
CERTAINLY CHRIST HAUNTED TO BE GAY IN A COMMUNITY STEEPED IN
YOUNG IT FEELS LIKE A BALL OF LEAD IN THE SOUL BOTH HEAVY AND TOXIC
THIS FOOTBALL PLAYING PREACHER'S KID
WAS GAY
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD FEEL LIKE BEING A GAY PREACHER'S KID IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH
WELL THIS WAS MY TWO
WHEN I SAY OVERNIGHT I MEAN I LITERALLY WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING WITH SO MANY NOTIFICATIONS ON MY PHONE I THOUGHT I SLEPT THROUGH A NATIONAL TRAGEDY
TREATING YOU LIKE T'CHALLA THE BLACK PANTHER FROM THE MARVEL UNIVERSE IS FLATTERING
IS THE MILLENNIALS GET A LIFE TIME OF DIET BRAND HISTORY I MEAN AMERICA SEEMS TO BE HELLBENT ON
I ADMIT THIS RACE STUFF CAN BE KIND OF DIVISIVE YOU SEE I AM AN INNATELY CURIOUS PERSON AND AS I DREW MY SWORD TO ENGAGE IN EPIC BATTLES IN THE COMMENTS
ALSO
MISSED THE MEMO ABOUT THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE INTERNET AGE
I REMEMBER
BEING CALLED
HIGHLY COLORFUL RACIAL SLURS
BY THOSE WHO USE THE ANONYMITY OF THE INTERNET AS A KLAN
HOOD SOME PEOPLE WERE PRETTY CREATIVE ACTUALLY
BUT OTHERS
THEIR MOMENTUM AND I AM GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT ELSE LEAD TO THE MOMENTUM OF THE ALT RIGHT THE LEFT WING'S WHOLESALE DEMONIZATION OF EVERYTHING WHITE AND MALE IF YOU ARE A PALE SKIN PENIS HAVER YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH SATAN
CONVERSATIONS START COUNTRIES THEY BUILD BRIDGES AND WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN CONVERSATIONS ARE THE LAST TOOL THAT HUMANS USE BEFORE THEY PICK UP THE GUNS
AND I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT ONLINE SAFE CONVERSATIONS FROM THE SECURITY OF YOUR LAPTOP NO I
AM TALKING ABOUT IN YOUR FACE CONVERSATIONS WITH REAL BREATHING PEOPLE AND FOR ME THIS LOOKS LIKE RUNNING A COMMUNITY FORUM CALLED SHOP TALK LIVE
LITTLE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE TOPIC YOU SEE THIS WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF BLACK LIVES MATTER FUROR AND PEOPLE SEEMED TO BE TURNING TO ME TO ARTICULATE THEIR VIEW POINTS HONESTLY IT WAS SORT OF OVERWHELMING
BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT A FEW OF MY TROLLS ACTUALLY HAD BRAINS
WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE CURIOUS AND WANT TO UNDERSTAND THEM EVEN FURTHER
ALTHOUGH THE SUPPOSED MORONS
ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE ORIGINAL THOUGHT
I SAID TO MYSELF
THESE GUYS ARE HIGHLY MISINFORMED
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO MY KNOWLEDGE
WHERE ARE THESE GUYS GETTING THEIR ARGUMENTS FROM WAS THERE SOME KIND OF ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE WITH ALTERNATIVE FACTS
I SET UP THIS GHOST PROFILE AND WENT CRAZY
ON
A PRACTICAL LEVEL IT WAS VERY SIMPLE
BUT ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL IT WAS KIND OF DAUNTING ESPECIALLY WITH THE RACIST VITRIOL THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED BUT WHAT I DID NOT REALIZE IS THAT MY TROLLS WERE INOCULATING ME
THICKENING MY SKIN MAKING ME IMMUNE TO VIEW POINTS THAT I DID NOT NECESSARILY AGREE WITH SO I DID NOT REACT TO THE SAME THINGS AS I WOULD HAVE SEVERAL MONTHS
OF THESE IDEAS ARE EASILY DEBUNKED ALT FACTS HAVE THAT QUALITY HOWEVER ONE THING KEPT SCREAMING AT ME TO THE SUBTEXT OF THESE
WORKED FINE FOR A WHILE BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE MY ONLINE FOOTPRINT HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE PATTERNS THAT I LIKE TO HEAR
TARGET MARKETING ALGORITHM THAT FEEDS YOU MORE OF THE PRODUCTS YOU LIKE TO BUY ALSO FEEDS YOU MORE THE NEWS THAT YOU LIKE TO HEAR
I HAD BEEN LIVING IN AN ONLINE UNIVERSE THAT REFLECTED MY WORLD VIEW BACK TO ME
MY TIMELINE WAS PRETTY LIBERAL I HAD NO BREITBART
OR INFOWARS OR FOX NEWS NO I WAS ALL MSNBC AND THE DAILY SHOW
AND THINK YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE NEEDED ACTING TRAINING AND MAKEUP AND A FAKE ID
NOW I CAN JUST LURK
I
STARTED WITH A
LITTLE INFOWARS
WENT ON INTO SOME AMERICAN RENAISSANCE NATIONAL VANGUARD ALLIANCE
I STARTED TO COMMENT ON ALL VIDEOS TALKING BAD ABOUT AL SHARPTON AND BLACK LIVES MATTER
I STARTED BEMOANING RACE BAITERS LIKE
ERIC HOLDER AND BARACK OBAMA
HOW THE WORLD WIDE WEB WAS GOING TO SPAN THE REACHES OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT
PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE
AND THIS MAGICAL SUPERHIGHWAY ALSO TOOK THE DEMONS OF OUR NATURE AND GAVE THEM FERRARIS
HEAVEN FORBID YOU LOVE GOD THIS COUNTRY AND MEAN IT
RIGHT
AND ANOTHER THING THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS THIS FEAR THAT THEY HAD OF SOMETHING THAT THEY LABELED AS
WHITE GENOCIDE
THAT DIVERSITY
WOULD BE THE FORCE TO WIPE THEM OUT
NOW LISTEN
FOLKS CONVERSATIONS MAY BE INDEED THE KEY TO THAT UPGRADE BECAUSE REMEMBER
LANGUAGE WAS THE FIRST FORM OF VIRTUAL REALITY
IT IS LITERALLY A SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION
OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND TROUGH THIS DEVICE WE CHANGE THE PHYSICAL WORLD KEEP IN MIND
CONVERSATIONS STOP
AT FIRST
BUT DOWN THE ROAD IT GETS A LITTLE TROUBLESOME
YOU SEE THE INTERNET HAS ITS INTERESTING QUALITY IN ONE WAY TOTALLY BROUGHT THE WORLD TOGETHER I REMEMBER BEING A KID AND ALL THIS UTOPIAN PROPAGANDA WAS BEING DUMPED ON
FOR ANYBODY ELSE THE TRUTH IS FROM THE MAYOR TO THE FELON YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THAT BARBERSHOP
HELPING PEOPLE FIND JOBS TO MENTORING HOMELESS YOUTH
AND WE NEEDED TO DO THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS A SEVERE LACK OF TRUST IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY DUE TO THE VIOLENCE OF THE CRACK ERA
WE ENDED UP TAKING AGENCY INTO OUR OWN HANDS SOLVING OUR OWN PROBLEMS
BOOKS
WITH CLIFFNOTES VERSIONS OF ITS DARK PAST
THIS SEVERELY DECONTEXTUALIZES RACE AND THE ANGER ASSOCIATED WITH IT
AND THAT IS A FERTILE GROUND FOR ALT FACTS TO GROW
ADD IN THE WILD LANDSCAPE OF THE INTERNET AND IT IS EASY TO SELL RE BRANDED
MEIN KAMPF IDEAS TO A GENERATION WHO HAS BEEN FAILED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS
EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME SOMETHING
OUR GADGETS AIN'T GONNA TO SAVE US
ALL THESE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES
ARE ONLY MASTERY OF THE UNIVERSE OUT THERE NOT THE ONE IN HERE
AND SO THAT'S ALL IQ NOT EQ
THAT'S A DANGEROUS IMBALANCE WHERE DO YOU GET THE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
THE VIRTUES OF PATIENCE FORBEARANCE COMPASSION YOU KNOW
THE THINGS THAT MAKE SURE THAT THESE DEVICES HOWEVER ADVANCED BECOME A BLESSING NOT CURSE
SEEMS TO ME THAT HUMANITY ITSELF NEEDS AN UPGRADE
{LG} I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS I CARED ABOUT BUT WITH A CLICK OF A BUTTON
AND WHEN WE DO THIS NOT IF IT WILL BE CLEAR THAT THE KEY TO THIS UPGRADE WAS ALWAYS OUR INNER WORLD NOT SOME DEVICE THAT WE CREATE
AND THE DOORWAY TO THIS EXPERIENCE IS NOW AND
WE WILL FOREVER BE
EACH OTHER
THANK YOU
YOU FALL ON THIS ARGUMENT
SADLY TENDS TO BE AN ACCIDENT OF BIRTH
YOU ARE PROBABLY SURPRISED BY THIS PERSPECTIVE
AND SO WAS I
NEVER IN A BILLION YEARS DID I THINK THAT I COULD HAVE SOME KIND OF COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE WHO HATED MY GUTS
MIND YOU NOT ENOUGH COMPASSION LIKE WANT TO BE FRIENDS I DON'T HAVE INFINITE OLIVE BRANCHES TO EXTEND TO PEOPLE WHO
WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE ME ON THIS PLANET RIGHT
BUT JUST ENOUGH COMPASSION TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY GOT TO WHERE THEY ARE
AND TO BE HONEST THERE WERE A COUPLE OF FAIR POINTS
ONE OF THEM IS HOW LIBERALS
TO BREAK OUT OF THESE DIGITAL DIVIDES BECAUSE AS OUR TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR TRIBALISM BECOME MORE DANGEROUS THIS
SO WHAT I DECIDED TO DO WAS TO TRICK THE FACEBOOK ALGORITHM INTO FEEDING ME MORE NEWS THAT I DIDN'T NECESSARILY AGREE
CONVERSATIONS ARE THE WAY THESE BRIDGES ARE BUILT IT IS TIME WE START SEEING PEOPLE AS PEOPLE AND NOT SIMPLY THE IDEAS WE PROJECT ONTO THEM OR REACT TO HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT THE BARRIERS BUT THE GATEWAYS TO THE VERY THINGS THAT WE
RACE AIN'T ABOUT TO DIE OUT THE HUMAN RACE JOIN THE PARTY THE WATER IS GREAT {LG} UNTIL THE WATER GETS TOO HOT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TED TALK
GET
TO THIS POINT OF UNDERSTANDING YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF YOUR FEAR AND EMBRACE YOUR CURIOSITY AND SADLY TOO MANY PEOPLE WOULD NOT TAKE THIS JOURNEY TO SEE THE WORLD FROM THE OTHER SIDE
LET'S BE HONEST THAT DOES NOT JUST GO FOR PROGRESSIVES BUT ALSO TO THE RIGHT WING AND CONSERVATIVES AS FAIR AS SOME OF THEIR POINTS WERE THEY WERE STILL TRAPPED IN THEIR OWN ECHO CHAMBERS
RECYCLING OLD OUTDATED POINTS OF VIEW NEVER GETTING A DIVERSITY IN PERSPECTIVE
THE MOST DIVISIVE SUBJECT IN AMERICAN LIFE BUT IT IS THE WAY THAT I ARTICULATED RACE THAT MADE ME SOMEWHAT OF A DIGITAL LIGHTENING ROD BEING A SURVIVOR MYSELF OF POLICE BRUTALITY HAVING LOST A CHILDHOOD FRIEND
DIGITALLY I BEGAN TO INFILTRATE THE INFAMOUS ALT RIGHT MOVEMENT MY DOPPELGANGER WAS EDGAR RICE
UNDERSTANDABLY I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY KIND OF UNBEATABLE MONSTER THERE WAS NO GIANT OUT THERE WITHOUT PERHAPS A SIMPLE ACHILLES HEEL WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR RACE THAT'S MAN MADE NATURE JUST CARES ABOUT HEALTHY ORGANISMS AND YOUR PRECIOUS ETHNIC FEATURES ARE EXPENDABLE TO THAT END
SO THE
MOMENT THAT YOU LET GO OF THAT RACIST IDENTITY AND RE LATCH ONTO HUMANITY ALL YOUR PROBLEMS GO AWAY
JOURNEY BEGAN WITH A TERRIBLY POPULAR CELL PHONE VIDEO AND A FALLEN FRIEND YOUR JOURNEY BEGINS RIGHT ABOUT NOW
WAS
WHY SHOULD I BE HATED FOR WHO I CANNOT HELP BUT BE
NOW AS A BLACK MAN IN AMERICA THAT RESONATED WITH ME
I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST ATTEMPTS TO DEMONIZE ME AND MAKE ME APOLOGIZE FOR WHO I AM
JUST MIRRORING THE ANTI BLACK SENTIMENT THAT WAS THROWN AT ME AND TO BE HONEST IT WAS KIND OF EXHILARATING
YOU SEE TECHNOLOGY IS A LOT LIKE MONEY IT BRINGS OUT WHAT WAS ALREADY INSIDE YOU AND AMPLIFIES IT SO I SOON BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE PHENOMENON OF AN INTERNET TROLL
WAS THE CRAZIEST THING BUT WHEN IT CAME TO MY INFLUENCE TO MY EXPOSURE I LITERALLY TOOK A QUANTUM LEAP SO I MADE MORE VIDEOS AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF MY VIDEOS WAS
OF THESE VOICES HAVE THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY WANT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY WILL NOT HEAR THEM DUE TO THE POWER OF THESE
I TRANSLATE NATURAL MECHANICS INTO WOODEN PARTS THAT ARE OPERATED BY STRINGS AND SPRINGS
IT THAT MADE PINOCCHIO COME TO LIFE MANY OF YOU MIGHT SAY IT WAS MAGIC A GOOD FAIRY TURNED HIM INTO A REAL BOY
RIGHT THE PUPPETEER I THINK IS MORE LIKE A MUSICIAN
GONE OUT ON A SHIP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER STORM TO COUNT GULLS I'VE
WE CAN'T ANSWER USING OURSELVES BECAUSE OF LOGISTICAL OR ETHICAL CHALLENGES
NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD GO OUT AND CHEAT TONIGHT THAT WOULD BE KIND OF BAD BUT IF YOU DO YOU MIGHT JUST END UP WITH REALLY SEXY CHILDREN {LG}
BUT THEY ARE CALCULATING LITTLE ANIMALS THEY ONLY HELP EACH OTHER IF THEY ARE BEING HELPED BACK IT IS A FAMOUS STRATEGY IN GAME THEORY THAT'S CALLED TIT FOR TAT
WE CAN ASK THIS QUESTION IN BIRDS BIRDS DO THIS THING CALLED MOBBING WHERE THEY COME HELP EACH OTHER TO DRIVE OFF PREDATORS
RESULT OF THIS THING IS THAT THE PROMISCUOUS FEMALE HAS WAY MORE GRANDCHILDREN THAN THE FAITHFUL ONE THIS IS CALLED THE GOOD GENES HYPOTHESIS
THAN JUST THEIR LOOKS
AS ORNITHOLOGISTS WE'RE CRAZY PEOPLE WE
WAKE UP AT 5 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND DRIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO MARVEL AT THE BIRDS AT THEIR BEAUTY
OUR BEHAVIOR OURSELVES QUESTIONS THAT APPLY TO
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO STUDY THIS QUESTION IN HUMANS
THIS TEDX TALK I DON'T WANT TO GO PARTY I DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX AND I'M SURE
THEY ALSO CHEAT HAVE SEX WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS ALL THE TIME THIS HAPPENS AROUND 30 OF TIME SO WHY IS THAT WHY DO PEOPLE AND WHY DO BIRDS CHEAT {LG}
SO EMPATHY THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE SOME BUT NOT ALL ENABLES THESE BIRDS TO KEEP COOPERATION GOING AND
EVOLUTIONARY FITNESS AND THIS IS WHY
I WILL SHOW YOU THAT WE CAN STUDY BIRDS TO ANSWER FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT EMPATHY SEX AND
IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT
BIRDS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CITIES AFFECT OUR BEHAVIOR AND OUR HORMONES
CARE OF THE BABIES MUCH THE SAME WAY AS WE DO AND THIS MAKES BIRDS MORE SIMILAR TO US THAN MANY MAMMALS BECAUSE BIPARENTAL CARE IS RATHER RARE IN ANIMAL
SO NEXT TIME YOU SEE BIRD ASK YOURSELF CAN I LEARN SOMETHING FROM YOU
TO HAVE SEX DOES NOT STAND ALONE THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT AFFECT
IN DEVELOPMENT CAN HAVE MAJOR EFFECTS ON YOUR TESTOSTERONE
BY UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH STRESS AFFECTS OUR LIVES BY WHICH STRESS AFFECTS REPRODUCTION
WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS CURES AND SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS THAT AFFECT US OUR OWN PROBLEMS
AND DISEASES
WHEN I SAY THAT TO PEOPLE THEY USUALLY ASSUME I'M ONE OF THOSE CRAZY PEOPLE THAT WAKES UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT DRIVES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO SEE SOME OBSCURE BIRD
ASK THIS IN BIRDS BECAUSE MANY ASPECTS OF STRESS AND REPRODUCTION ARE REGULATED BY HORMONES AND BIRDS AND HUMANS SHARE
SOME OF US STRESS IS NOT JUST THIS ONE TIME THING IT'S A CONSTANT OCCURRENCE WE ARE STRESSED DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR TESTOSTERONE I ASKED THIS IN THESE BIRDS
ANCIENT THAT IT'S SHARED BETWEEN BIRDS AND HUMANS AND IT LIKELY EVOLVED TO HELP US COOPERATE
BIRDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT OURSELVES ABOUT HOW STRESS AFFECTS REPRODUCTION
ASKED THESE BROWN AMERICAN SPARROWS HOW THE STRESS AFFECTS TESTOSTERONE AND
START TO SEE THESE AMAZING PARALLELS BETWEEN BIRDS AND US YOU
{NS} BUT WHAT THE PROMISCUOUS FEMALE HAS THAT THE FAITHFUL ONE DOES NOT IS THIS SON THAT WAS FATHERED IN THAT PROMISCUOUS MATING AND THIS SON GROWS UP TO BE JUST LIKE HIS DAD
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR WE FOLLOW THE BABIES WE FOLLOW THE BABIES' BABIES THE HUMAN EQUIVALENT OF THIS WOULD BE TO STUDY AN ENTIRE TOWN FOR SOMETHING LIKE 200 YEARS IT'S A PRETTY HARD TASK
MAKE SENSE TO STUDY CANCER IN BIRDS BECAUSE THEIR ORGANS ARE LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM OURS
BUT BECAUSE THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS ARE SO SIMILAR
TO US
BECAUSE THEIR BEHAVIOR THEIR SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IS SO SIMILAR TO OURS WE CAN USE BIRDS TO ASK BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT EMPATHY ABOUT COOPERATION
STRESS SEX AND MANY MORE THINGS
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON SO OUR HORMONES THESE COMPLICATED INTRICATE SYSTEMS ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL
HOW DOES STRESS AFFECT OUR REPRODUCTION WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN WE
IN THIS SPECIES MEANS OLDER BIGGER AND THIS BIG WHITE
THINGS FROM OTHER'S PERSPECTIVE EMPATHY MAKES US WHO WE ARE IT ALLOWS US TO FORGIVE
DO THIS BECAUSE I REALLY REALLY LIKE BIRDS I THINK THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL AND THINK THEY'RE FUN
NOT BE BAD THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD BECAUSE MAYBE IT IS BETTER TO FOCUS YOUR ENERGY
MIND IF I TAKE MY JACKET OFF AND YOU DON'T MIND AND I DO LIKE THAT
JUMPED BACKWARDS AND HE DID AND TO ME THAT IS A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT CREATIVITY IS BECAUSE HE DID THREE THINGS THAT ARE CRUCIAL IN CREATIVITY THE FIRST ONE
HE DID SOMETHING ORIGINAL DIFFERENT
CREATIVITY IS DOING SOMETHING ORIGINAL DIFFERENT AND HE DID HE JUMPED BACKWARDS
BUT IF DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT HE COULD JUMP ONLY HALF A METER HE WOULD BE REMEMBERED AS THAT STRANGE EXTRAVAGANT JUMP ATHLETE IN MEXICO
THE SECOND CONDITION IS TO DO IT BETTER
INTERVIEWS ME
I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS GOING TO BE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SEX IN ADVERTISING
AND MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE
SAME YOU CAN USE SEX BADLY
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU PUT AN
ALMOST NUDE
GIRL
ON THE HOOD
OF A CAR
IT IS BAD IDEA
BECAUSE VERY PROBABLY THE PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THE GIRL
AND NOT AT THE CAR
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO SELL THE CAR
BUT SEX CAN BE USED IN A MORE CLEVER WAY
BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING SO COMMON
SO NORMAL IN THE CIVILIZATION IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO OFTEN
AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH SEX
SO SEX IS A GOOD CREATIVE PATH BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE HUMAN BEING
BUT
YOU HAVE TO USE IT VERY CAREFULLY AND WITH
SOME INTELLIGENCE
ADVERTISING IS INFINITE YOU CAN USE THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO SELL A PRODUCT OR TO BUILD A BRAND
BUT IN FACT THERE NO MORE THAN 20
BASIC CREATIVE PATHS
I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU SIX THIS AFTERNOON THE SIX THAT I CONSIDER PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES AND THE FIRST ONE IS THE ONE YOU JUST SAW
POPULAR PEOPLE FAMOUS PEOPLE
FAMOUS TESTIMONIALS
A FAMOUS TESTIMONIAL
GIVES YOU A LOT MORE
YOU
WILL REMEMBER MUCH MORE
THE CAMPAIGN IF THE CAMPAIGN USES A FAMOUS TESTIMONIAL THAN IF YOU DON'T
THE PROOF IS THAT
22 YEARS AGO
THE
GOVERNMENT OF CATALONIA ASKED ME TO MAKE A CAMPAIGN
TO CONVINCE YOUNG PEOPLE NOT TO SMOKE OR TO STOP SMOKING
A FEW MONTHS BEFORE JOHAN CRUYFF THE FAMOUS FOOTBALL PLAYER AND COACH OF THE BARCELONA FOOTBALL TEAM
HAD
A HEART ATTACK BECAUSE OF HIS HABIT
OF
TOBACCO
SMOKING TOO MUCH
I ASKED HIM TO DO THE CAMPAIGN FOR US AND HE ACCEPTED
AND I ASKED HIM TO SAY EXACTLY THAT
I AM JOHANN CRUYFF
I HAD TWO VICES
IN MY LIFE
SMOKING
AND PLAYING FOOTBALL
FOOTBALL HAS GIVEN ME EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE
AND SMOKING
ALMOST
KILLED ME
THAT'S THE COMMERCIAL
A CRAZY MAN CALLED DICK FOSBURY
AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES OF MEXICO DECIDED TO DO IT
IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY
INSTEAD OF JUMPING LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE HE JUMPED BACKWARDS
I WAS WATCHING THOSE GAMES
AND I THOUGHT THIS MAN IS GOING TO BREAK
HIS BACK
BUT HE DIDN'T AND NOT ONLY HE DIDN'T BREAK HIS BACK BUT HE JUMPED HIGHER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE LET'S
IS SOMETHING
USED MANY MANY TIMES BY MANY MANY BRANDS ESPECIALLY
IN
PERFUMERY AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAD MADE A RELATION
A SEDUCTION
BETWEEN
TWO PEOPLE
THAT'S THE SECOND
CREATIVE PATH THAT IS REALLY VERY VERY USEFUL
WHAT ELSE
MIES VAN DE ROHE SAID THAT IN ARCHITECTURE
LESS IS MORE
I SAY IN ADVERTISING ALSO LESS IS MORE
WHEN I HAD TO MAKE A CAMPAIGN FOR THE LOTTO THE LOTTERY I SAW THAT MOST OF THE COMMERCIALS OF THE WORLD WERE SHOWING VERY RICH PEOPLE WITH PLENTY OF JEWELRY CARS GIRLS BIG CIGARS ETC AND I THOUGHT WE HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER IDEA
TO SELL THE LOTTERY
AND I FOUND ANOTHER VERY SIMPLE IDEA
TO TELL PEOPLE THAT IF THEY WON THE LOTTERY SOMETHING VERY GOOD
WILL HAPPEN TO THEM
ONE COMMERCIAL ALARM
WANTS IN FACT
NOT TO HAVE TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
SO THAT'S TO BE RICH NOT TO HAVE TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IN FACT
CREATIVITY AS I SAID BEFORE IS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT
BETTER AND CONVERTS THIS NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS IN THE STANDARDS OF A NEW WAY
THANK YOU VERY
WAY
OF
DOING IN THE STANDARD IN THE NORMAL WAY OF DOING IT FROM THAT DAY ON
THREE YEARS BEFORE THE OLYMPIC GAMES
THE MAYOR OF BARCELONA PASQUAL MARAGALL CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO PITCH
FOR THE OPENING AND CLOSING CEREMONIES
AND I SAID PASQUAL NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE SEEN ONE OLYMPIC CEREMONY AND IT WAS AWFUL
I CAN DO THE ADVERTISING FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES IF YOU WANT
AND HE ANSWERED IN A VERY CLEVER WAY HE SAID NO I AM NOT GOING TO DO ADVERTISING FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES
BUT YOU CAN DO A CEREMONY
THAT CAN CHANGE THE IMAGE OF BARCELONA CATALONIA AND SPAIN
SO HE PERSUADED ME WITH THAT IDEA AND I DECIDED TO PITCH FOR THE OPENING AND CLOSING CEREMONIES PUTTING ALL MY EFFORT IN
CONVERTING THOSE THREE HOURS AND A HALF
IN A THREE
AND THAT WILL BE
REMEMBERED AS THE EXCEPTION
NO NO HE WAS A NORMAL PERSON
AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT HAD TO JUMP AFTER HIM
IN ORDER TO ARRIVE TO HIS HIGHT HAD TO JUMP LIKE HIM
SO HIS WAY OF DOING HIS NEW WAY OF DOING BECAME THE STANDARD THE NORMAL WAY
YOU IF LLUIS BASSAT TOOKS HIS JACKET OFF BEFORE HIS SPEECH PROBABLY MOST OF YOU WON'T REMEMBER IT BUT IF I ASK YOU AGAIN DO
EVEN THE WAY THAT HE USES HIS VEST
DOING IT IN A NORMAL WAY FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM TOOK HIM SEVEN SECONDS FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP A STRANGE WAY
OF
USING THEIR VEST ONLY FIVE SECONDS AND A HALF
THAT DAY AND I WAS 12 YEARS OLD I DECIDED TO CHALLENGE EVERYHING
THAT WAS DONE IN MY HOME
I USED TO ASKED MY MOTHER WHY ARE YOU DOING THINGS LIKE THAT AND HER ANSWER WAS ALWAYS BECAUSE MY MOTHER DID LIKE THAT
TO ME THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT
ANSWER
I WOULD LIKE
TO
TRY TO DEFINE CREATIVITY
IN ORDER TO DO THAT I WILL USE SOME
IMAGES
GREY ADVERTISING
I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT CREATIVITY
BUT LET ME START SHOWING TO YOU
WHAT
AND HOW I BECAME
PART OF THIS WORLD WHEN I WAS TWELVE12 YEARS OLD MY PARENTS TOOK ME TO A MOVIE THEATER
AND I SAW A FILM CALLED THIRTEEN BY THE DOZEN
IN THIS FILM
THE PROTAGONIST
WAS A FATHER OF 12 CHILDREN
AND HE
USED TO WORK IN A
CAR COMPANY
HE DECIDED TO USE IN HIS HOUSE
THE SAME SYSTEMS AS HE USED AT THE
CAR COMPANY
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN BUT ALSO THE EFFECTIVITY OF ALL DECISIONS THEY WERE TAKING AT HOME
LET ME SHOW THE FEW SECONDS THAT CHANGED MY LIFE
TO OBSERVE THESE FEATURES BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE
THAT'S HOME THAT'S US SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE EACH UNIQUE IN THEIR OWN ACCORD CALL THAT PLANET HOME
LIFE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT WATER
SO THE PLACES WHERE WE FIND THESE STREAKS
ARE PROBABLY PRESENTLY HABITABLE
ALSO WHEN WE EVENTUALLY GO TO MARS
WE DON'T NEED TO BRING WATER WITH US
IT'S THERE
THIS IMAGE WAS TAKEN BY NASA'S CURIOSITY ROVER ON MARS
AS I SAT IN FRONT OF MY DUSTY OLD COMPUTER AND GAZED AT THE TERABYTES OF DATA WE HAD FROM MARS ONE THING CAUGHT MY EYES IN TWO IMAGES OF THE SAME PLACE ON MARS SOMETHING HAD CHANGED
AFTER 80000 YEARS SINCE HUMANS HAD STARTED VENTURING OUT OF AFRICA
AFTER 50 YEARS SINCE HUMANS HAD STARTED STUDYING MARS WITH SPACECRAFT
WE HAVE FINALLY CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF WATER ON MARS
THE FINDINGS MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS
ENDED UP FINDING ABOUT THESE FEATURES WAS TELLING US THAT WATER PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THEIR FORMATION
HOWEVER WE DID NOT HAVE THAT DEFINITE EVIDENCE
FAST FORWARD FOUR YEARS AND
I AM A GRADUATE STUDENT
MY PASSION FOR SPACE AND EXPLORATION IS STRONG AS EVER
AND I DECIDED TO DO MUCH MORE INTENSIVE RESEARCH
TO UNDERSTAND THESE FEATURES
I DECIDED I WOULD TAKE AN UNCONVENTIONAL ROUTE IN DATA ANALYSIS IT
WAS A RISK BUT
IT'S A RISK WORTH TAKING
BECAUSE AT THE END
IT ENDED UP GIVING US THAT EVIDENCE WE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR
OR WHEN I WROTE ABOUT HOW I USED TO ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF ME AND
HOW I OVERCAME THAT OR
IT COULD'VE BEEN WHEN I WROTE ABOUT MY ANXIETY AND
MY FEAR OF FAILURE AND WHAT I DID TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES WHATEVER IT WAS
IT WAS WHAT THAT PERSON NEEDED IN THEIR TIME OF NEED
CONTINUED TO WRITE AND SHARE THINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM SOMEONE WHO I HADN'T SPOKEN TO IN OVER 10 YEARS WHAT THIS PERSON SAID TO ME COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE HERE'S WHAT THE MESSAGE
CHALLENGES YOU MIGHT WONDER WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF WE COULD ACTUALLY JUST GO IN AND MAKE OUR OWN MEDICINES WE
WE STARTED THIS JOURNEY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
IS A LONG JOURNEY AND THERE ARE MANY STEPS WITHIN THIS JOURNEY THE INCREDIBLE NEWS IS THAT WE'RE NOW AT THE POINT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR WE'LL BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO BRING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO MARKET IN A RAPID TIME FRAME THAT WILL IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES
BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT WORK THAT'S LEFT FOR US TO DO TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS TECHNOLOGY AND BROADLY DEVELOP NEW MEDICINES AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE ON THIS PLANET
THANK YOU
VERY FAR DISTANCES FROM WHERE THE MEDICINE IS ACTUALLY BEING
LARGE NUMBERS OF PROTEINS FROM DIFFERENT ORGANISMS AND MOVE THEM INTO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ORGANISM FROM ANY OF THEM THAT WE PULLED FROM
TO CREATE THE PERFECT BEAST
IN DOING THIS WE'RE NOW ABLE TO MOVE BEYOND THE MOLECULES THAT OPIUM POPPY GIVES US NATURALLY AND DIRECTLY MAKE IMPROVED MEDICINES FOR OUR THERAPEUTIC USE
THIS LEADS TO THE SECOND CHALLENGE THAT THEN COMES
OF OUR MOST VALUABLE AND NEEDED MEDICINES ARE NOT GOING TO BE PROVIDED BY NATURE
THESE PLANTS ARE NOT MAKING THESE COMPOUNDS AS MEDICINES FOR US THEY'RE MAKING THESE COMPOUNDS FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES OFTENTIMES FOR DEFENSE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE'S JUST A LARGE
SET OF MEDICINES THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SOURCE FROM NATURE
THE THIRD IS THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET STILL TO THIS DAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT ACCESS TO MEDICINES
WITH ALL
STILL TO THIS DAY THE LARGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ON OUR PLANET HAVE INSUFFICIENT ACCESS TO
IS THIS IT ARE WE ABLE TO COMPLETELY DECLARE VICTORY THE ANSWER IS NOT
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE OPIUM POPPY IT'S FROM THIS PLANT THAT WE GET MANY OF OUR MOST EFFECTIVE PAIN MEDICINES WE USED THIS AS OUR
SO DIFFICULT CHANCES ARE WE'LL UNDERSTAND THESE PATTERNS JUST AS LITTLE AS THE BRAINS THAT PRODUCE
OUT WHAT THE SYMBOLS IN A CODE MEAN IT'S ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM TO REARRANGE THEM AT
NEURONS CONTAIN OUR LIGHT ACTIVATED PORE AND OTHERS DON'T
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH ELECTRODES HAS REMAINED STATE OF THE ART UNTIL TODAY DESPITE A NUMBER OF DRAWBACKS
REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED IN THE EXPERIMENTS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WE HAVE LIFTED THE IDENTITY OF THE CRITIC
IS WRITTEN IN THE FORM OF ELECTRICAL IMPULSES GALVANI'S APPROACH
OF GENES GET TURNED ON AND OFF IN DIFFERENT CELLS YOU CAN EXPLOIT THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT
IS WEAK THE MOTORS WILL STAY OFF AND THE FLY WILL CONTINUE STRAIGHT ON ITS COURSE IF THE CONNECTION IS
HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE CRITIC DOES ITS JOB COME TO THINK OF IT KNOWING WHEN YOU'RE WRONG
MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE MIND EVEN IF IT'S THE MIND OF THE FLY THIS IS ONE PIECE OF GOOD
UPSIDE DOWN SO INSTEAD OF INSERTING A WIRE INTO ONE SPOT OF THE
CELL WITH THE RIGHT GENETIC MAKEUP WILL SPONTANEOUSLY PRODUCE A RECEIVER THAT
FOR IT TURNS OUT THAT WE CAN FABRICATE THE RECEIVERS OUT OF MATERIALS THAT ARE ENCODED IN DNA
WIRELESS FORM OF COMMUNICATION AND SECOND JUST AS IN A RADIO BROADCAST
THROUGH BIOLOGY NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THESE MIRACULOUS RECEIVERS UP
TO CONTROL THE FUNCTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WILL AT ONCE UNRAVEL ALL ITS MYSTERIES BUT WE'LL
TOOK THESE FIRST STEPS THE FIELD OF OPTOGENETICS HAS EXPLODED AND
THE ODOR DETECTORS AND THE MOTORS THAT POWER THE FLY'S EVASIVE ACTIONS
ALONE WON'T DO WE NEED TO REARRANGE THE PATTERN IN OTHER
HAVEN'T SOLVED A SINGLE EXAMPLE OF HOW INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR SPRINGS FROM THE PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS IN LIVING MATTER
ON ITS PATH AND IT SUFFERS SOME PAINFUL CONSEQUENCE SUCH AS GETTING ZAPPED IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WE WOULD
WILL TURN ON AND THE FLY WILL INITIATE A TURN
GET THERE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE THANK YOU
BUT BRUTALLY EFFECTIVE EXPERIMENT SHE CUT THE HEADS OFF OF HER FLIES
MUST BE CONTAINED AMONG THE DOPAMINE PRODUCING NEURONS ON THE LEFT BUT NOT AMONG THE DOPAMINE PRODUCING NEURONS ON THE RIGHT
DETAILED OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS THEY
EXHILARATING TO SEE HOW VAGUE PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTIONS EVAPORATE AND GIVE
ON THE FLIGHT MOTOR OF WHAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF THE SPINAL CORD OF THESE FLIES AND GET SOME OF THE HEADLESS BODIES TO ACTUALLY TAKE OFF AND FLY
TO IDENTIFY THE CELLS IN THE FLY'S BRAIN THAT PLAYED THE ROLE OF THE CRITIC AND THE LOGIC OF OUR EXPERIMENT WAS SIMPLE
WITH MANY RECEIVERS AT ONCE YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHERE THESE RECEIVERS ARE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THESE RECEIVERS MOVE JUST THINK OF THE STEREO IN YOUR CAR IT GETS EVEN
TO SPEAK UP AND TO TELL THE ACTOR TO CHANGE ITS POLICY WE HAVE CREATED SUCH SITUATION ARTIFICIALLY {NS} BY TURNING ON THE CRITIC WITH A FLASH OF LIGHT
A STRENGTHENING OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CURRENTLY ACTIVE ODOR DETECTOR AND THE MOTORS SO THE NEXT TIME THE FLY FINDS ITSELF FACING THE SAME ODOR AGAIN
FOR AN INTELLIGENT BEING LIKE OUR FLY THIS POLICY IS NOT WRITTEN IN STONE BUT RATHER CHANGES AS THE ANIMAL LEARNS FROM
LIKE ME OR THE SUPER EGO IF YOU'RE FREUDIAN OR YOUR MOTHER IF YOU'RE JEWISH
FOR THE FUTURE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE SINCE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ THE
ACHIEVE INCREDIBLE PRECISION THIS IS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH EACH CELL IN OUR BODIES CONTAINS THE SAME SET OF GENES
ITS FUNCTION I HOPE YOU'LL APPRECIATE THE BEAUTIFUL SIMPLICITY OF THIS CONCEPT
THROUGH MANY SUCH EXPERIMENTS WE WERE ABLE TO NARROW DOWN THE IDENTITY OF THE CRITIC TO JUST 12 CELLS
A TEACHER OR YOUR MOTHER TELLING YOU IS A VERY HARD PROBLEM THERE ARE SOME IDEAS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS TO HOW THIS MIGHT BE DONE
ANIMALS TWITCH OR JUMP WE CAN NOW ACTUALLY INTERFERE WITH THEIR PSYCHOLOGY IN RATHER PROFOUND WAYS AS I'LL SHOW YOU IN MY LAST EXAMPLE WHICH IS DIRECTED AT A FAMILIAR
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO TURN ON THE MOTORS AND TO TRIGGER AN EVASIVE MANEUVER
TO LIGHT RECEPTORS SIMILAR TO THE ONES IN YOUR EYES WHENEVER FLASH OF
SHOWED THAT A FROG'S LEGS TWITCHED WHEN HE CONNECTED THE LUMBAR NERVE TO A SOURCE OF ELECTRICAL
YOUR EMOTIONS YOUR MEMORIES
THE CRITIC IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN WHAT MAKES US INTELLIGENT SO WE
JUST PASSED BY {LG} AND EVERYTHING I HAD TO DO FROM THAT MOMENT WAS TO PREPARE ME TO BE A PERFECT WOMAN AT THE AGE OF 12 MY DAY STARTED AT
BECASUE MY MOTHER A WOMEN SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED
TO OWN ANY PROPERTY AND BY DEFAULT EVERYTHING IN MY FAMILY ANYWAY BELONGED TO MY FATHER SO HE HAD THE RIGHT
AND IF MY MOTHER EVER QUESTIONED HIM
HE'D BEAT HER ABUSED HER
AND REALLY
IT WAS DIFFICULT
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
DAD I NEED HELP CAN YOU SUPPORT ME TO GO TO AMERICA I PROMISED HIM THAT I'LL BE THE BEST GIRL I WILL COME BACK ANYTHING THEY WANTED AFTER THAT I WILL DO IT FOR THEM HE SAID
THE REST OF HIS LIFE
SO HE FIGURED OUT WELL HE SAID OK
YOU'LL GO TO SCHOOL AFTER THE CEREMONY
I DID
THE CEREMONY HAPPENNED IT'S A WHOLE WEEK LONG OF EXCITMENTS
IT'S A CEREMONY PEOPLE ARE ENJOYING
AND THE DAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL CEREMONY HAPPENS WE WERE DANCING HAVING EXCEITMENTS AND THROUGH ALL THE NIGHT WE DID NOT SLEEP
THE ACTUAL DAY CAME
AND WE WALKED OUT OF
I TALKED TO MY FATHER I DID SOMETHING THAT MOST GIRLS HAVE NEVER DONE I TOLD MY FATHER I
WILL ONLY GO THROUGH THIS CEREMONY IF YOU'L LET ME GO BACK TO SCHOOL
THE REASON WHY IF I RAN AWAY MY FATHER WILL HAVE A STIGMA
PEOPLE WILL BE CALLING HIM THE FATHER OF THAT GIRL WHO DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE CEREMONY IT WAS A SHAMEFUL THING
CHIEF OR PERSON MALE AN ELDER IF HE SAYS YES EVERYBODY WILL FOLLOW HIM
SO I WENT TO HIM
VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING AS THE SUN HAD RISED THE FIRST THING THAT HE SEES WHEN HE OPENS HIS DOOR IS ME
MY CHILD WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
THAT MY FATHER WORKED AS A POLICEMEN
IN THE CITY HE CAME HOME ONCE A YEAR WE DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR SOMETIMES EVEN 2 YEARS
AND WHENEVER HE CAME HOME
IT WAS A DIFFERENT CASE
MY MOTHER WORKED HARD IN THE FARM
TO GROW CROP SO THAT WE CAN EAT SHE READ THE COWS AND THE GOATS SO THAT SHE CAN CARE FOR US
BUT WHEN MY
THERE WAS A WOMEN SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
AND THIS WOMEN
WAS WAITING
TO HOLD US
AND I WAS THE FIRST THERE WERE MY SISTERS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER GIRLS AS I APPROACH HER
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND
I SAT DOWN
AND I OPENED MY LEGS
AS I OPENED MY LEG
ANOTHER WOMEN CAME
AND THIS WOMEN WAS CARRYING A KNIFE
AND SHE
TO WHERE YOU ARE BECAUSE THIS MAN LOOKED VERY HAPPY
AND I ADMIRED THAT
AND HE TOLD ME
WELL
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO GO DON'T YOU HAVE A HUSBAND WAITING FOR YOU
AND I TOLD HIM
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT PART JUST TELL ME HOW TO GET
WAS IN A LAND OF PLENTY I ENJOYED MYSELF BUT DURING
THAT MOST WOMEN DON'T DO
THREE DAYS LATER AFTER EVERYBODY HAS LEFT THE HOME MY MOM WENT AND BROUGHT A NURSE WE WERE TAKEN CARE OF
THREE WEEKS LATER I WAS HEALED AND I WAS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WAS SO DETERMINED
TO BE A TEACHER NOW
SO THAT I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY FAMILY
WELL
WHILE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SOMETHING HAPPENED
AND SHE HELD MY CLITORIS AND SHE CUT IT OFF
I WORKED HARD IN SCHOOL BUT WHEN I WAS AN EIGHT GRADER IT WAS A DETERMINING FACTOR IN OUR
AS WE MOVED
AND I WENT TO TALK TO THE FATHERS HE FATHERS OF COURSE YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THEY SAID
WE WANT A SCHOOL FOR BOYS AND
I SAID WELL
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MANY MEN FROM MY VILLAGE WHO HAD BEEN OUT AND THEY'VE GOT AN EDUCATION WHY CAN'T THEY BUILD SCHOOL FOR BOYS AND I'LL BUILD A SCHOOL FOR GIRLS THAT MADE SENS AND THEY AGREED
AND I TOLD THEM
I WANTED THEM TO SHOW ME A SIGN OF COMMITMENT
AND THEY DID
THEY DONATED LAND WHERE WE BUILD THE GIRLS' SCHOOL WE HAVE
I WANT YOU TO MEET ONE
BUT MOST OF ALL THE TEACHER WAS JUST WRITING ON THE BOARD NOT HARD WORK THAT'S
THEM THEY ALL CAME TOGETHER THE VILLAGE THE WOMEN THE MEN EVERYBODY CAME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT ME TO COME TO GET AN EDUCATION I ARRIVED IN AMERICA AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT DID
GOING TO CHANGE YOUR COUNTRY AND THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU DO THAT AND I DO THAT AREN'T WE GOING TO CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN FOR YOUR CHILDREN FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND WE WILL LIVE IN A VERY PEACEFUL WORLD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ARE BROUGHT UP TO BE WARRIORS
THE GIRLS ARE BROUGHT UP TO BE MOTHERS
WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS ENGAGED
TO BE MARRIED AS SOON AS I REACH PUBERTY
MY MOTHER MY GRANDMOTHER
MY AUNTIES THEY CONSTANTLY REMINDED ME THAT YOUR
THE UN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL TO GET MY GRADUATE WORK THE CONSTANT CRY OF THESE GIRLS WAS ON MY FACE
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
AS I WENT BACK
I STARTED TALKING TO THE MEN TO THE VILLAGE AND MOTHERS AND I SAID I WANT TO GIVE BACK THE WAY I HAD PROMISED YOU THAT I WOULD COME BACK AND HELP YOU
WHAT DO YOU NEED AS I SPOKE TO THE WOMEN THEY TOLD
BECAUSE AS YOU CHANGE YOUR WORLD AS
YOU CHANGE YOUR COMMUNITY AS WE BELIEVE WE ARE IMPACTING ONE GIRL ONE FAMILY ONE VILLAGE ONE COUNTRY AT A TIME WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE SO IF YOU CHANGE YOUR WORLD YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR
I BLED AFTER BLEEDING FOR A WHILE I FAINTED THERE AFTER IT'S SOMETHING THAT SO MANY GIRLS I'M LUCKY I NEVER DIED BUT MANY DIE IT'S PRACTICE WITH NO
BEGINNING IS HAPPENING
AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW 125 GIRLS WILL NEVER BE MUTILATED
125 GIRLS
WILL NOT BE MARRIED WHEN THEY ARE 12 YEARS OLD
125 GIRLS ARE CREATING AND ACHIEVING THEIR DREAMS
THIS IS THE THING THAT WE DOING
GIVING THEM OPPORTUNITIES SO THEY CAN
TO ME BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE VERY OPTIMISTIC YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS SO PASSIONATE YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO SEE A
ME AND MY SIBLINGS THAT SHE NEVER WANTED US TO LIVE THE LIFE SHE WAS LIVING WHY DID SHE SAY
SO I WENT BACK AND I HAD TO GO BACK TO THE
DAD WAS SICK
HE GOT A STROKE
AND HE WAS REALLY SICK SO HE REALLY COULDN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO NEXT
BUT THE PROBLEM IS MY FATHER IS NOT THE ONLY FATHER I HAVE
EVERYBODY WHO IS MY DAD'S AGE MALE IN THE COMMUNITY IS MY FATHER BY DEFAULT MY UNCLES ALL OF THEM THEY DICTATE WHAT MY FUTURE IS
SO THE NEWS
AND WE WERE TAKING IN GIRLS WHO WERE
IN THE FOURTH GRADE
EVERYBODY WERE TELLING US ANGELENE HAD BEEN MOVING FROM ONE PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S AN ORPHAN SHE HAS NO MOTHER SHE HAS NO FATHER MOVING FROM ONE GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE TO ANOTHER ONE FROM AUNTIES TO AUNTIES SHE HAD NO STABILITY IN HER LIFE
AND PEOPLE SAID
AND I LOOKED AT HER I REMEMBERED THAT DAY
AND I SAW SOMETHING BEYOND WHAT I WAS SEEING IN ANGELENE
AND YES SHE WAS OLDER TO BE IN FOURTH GRADE WE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME THE CLASS
FIVE
AND AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW THREE MILLION GIRLS IN AFRICA ARE AT RISK OF UNDERGOING THROUGH THIS MUTILATION
I LEARNED THAT MY MOM HAD A RIGHT TO OWN PROPERTY I LEARNED THAT DID NOT HAVE TO ABUSED BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMEN
THOSE THINGS MADE ME ANGRY
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
EVERY TIME I WENT BACK I
FOUND THAT MY NEIGHBOURS'
{NS} I NEEDED THE SUPPORT OF THE VILLAGE AND HERE AGAIN WHEN THE MEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THAT A WOMEN HAD GOTTEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SCHOOL THEY SAID WHAT A LOST OPPORTUNITY THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO A BOY WE
WAS A TRANSITION FOR ME TO GO TO HIGSCHOOL
THIS WAS THE CROSSROAD
ONCE I GO THROUGH THIS TRADTION
I WAS GOING TO BECOME A WIFE
WELL MY DREAM OF BECOMING A TEACHER WILL NOT COME TO PASS
SO I HAD TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO FIGURE THESE THINGS
TO SCHOOL IT'S BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS DENIED AN EDUCTION AND SHE
WANTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO MAKE OUR TOMORROW BETTER I WANT TO CHALLENGE TODAY TO
AND THE THOUGHT LITERALLY KEPT ME UP AT NIGHT SO IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO
THAT MAKES AROUND 17 SO 17 LUCID DREAMS AND GRANTED I WASN'T TRYING A HUNDRED PERCENT AT THE TIME
INDUCED LUCID DREAM NOW THESE TECHNIQUES REVOLVE AROUND THE HABIT OF QUESTIONING YOUR REALITY
A LUCID DREAM IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO AN ADEPT THE DREAM
VAGUE AND OUT OF CONTROL AND I QUICKLY FORGOT THEM BY THE TIME I WOKE UP
THING I NEEDED TO DO WAS TO REALIZE I WAS DREAMING IN A DREAM NOW TO DO THIS THERE ARE PLENTY OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND I COULD GO INTO
MUCH LIKE ASTRONAUTS EXPLORE SPACE AN ONEIRONAUT
I LOOKED AT IT I TOSSED IT UP IN THE AIR AND I FELT ITS WEIGHT I KNEW THAT WHAT I WAS SEEING WASN'T REAL BUT IT FELT REAL WHEN I FLY I FEEL THE WIND BUFFETING MY FACE WHEN I
DREAM IS ACTUALLY QUITE SPECIAL WHEN YOU EAT IN A LUCID DREAM OR AT LEAST WHEN I DO THE EXPERIENCE IS MUCH MORE TENSE
FOR WAKE INDUCED LUCID DREAMING NOW THIS
GO IN SLOW MOTION WHILE I JUST WALK IN NORMAL TIME I LOVE LETTING MY MIND GENERATE
THE FORCE AND SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT
SO SCIENTISTS AGREE THAT LUCID DREAMING IS REAL AND THAT ANYONE CAN HAVE ONE SIMPLY BECAUSE EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF DREAMING
COUNT YOURSELF AS LUCKY BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS EASY FOR THE REST OF US
NEW THINGS AND TRYING TO PROGRESS MORE AS A PERSON SO
BET THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE WATCHING RIGHT NOW THAT HAVE NATURALLY OCCURRING LUCID DREAMS NOW IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
AND PUSH IT THROUGH MY LEFT AND WHEN I'M DREAMING THEY GO RIGHT THROUGH EACH OTHER AND IT'S A VERY BIZARRE FEELING I PROMISE SO YES ALL IT REALLY TAKES IS ONE REALITY CHALLENGING THOUGHT
WHEN I LEARNED THAT WE'RE ASLEEP FOR ONE THIRD OF OUR LIVES
I WAS TERRIFIED
IT HONESTLY SCARED ME AND STILL DOES TO THINK THAT IF I WERE TO
LIVE FOR SAY
75 YEARS
25 OF THOSE YEARS WILL BE
WANT TO TRY THIS MORE OFTEN BECAUSE AFTER ALL WHAT IS THIS ALL FOR IT'S FOR ME TO TRY AND SLOWLY MAKE UP THAT 25 YEARS THAT I WOULD OTHERWISE SPEND
CAN I DO IN A LUCID DREAM SO HERE ARE FEW OTHER COOL THINGS THAT I REALLY ENJOY DOING WHEN I'M LUCID
I ACTUALLY ADMITTEDLY FALL OFF CLIFFS QUITE OFTEN IN MY DREAMS FUNNILY ENOUGH ANYWAY WHEN THE DREAMER REALIZES THAT THEY'RE DREAMING THEY'RE SAID TO ACHIEVE LUCIDITY AND BECOME LUCID IN THEIR DREAM
THING AND WRITING DOWN ALL THE DREAMS I COULD REMEMBER WHEN I WOKE UP I REALLY RECOMMEND
IS BEING FABRICATED IN MY BRAIN SO IN THAT SENSE
UNLEASH YOUR INFINITE CURIOSITY IN A SPACE WITH INFINITE
THEY DO THIS BY TRICKING THEIR BODY INTO FALLING ASLEEP WHILE THEIR MIND STAYS AWAKE NOW
TO A LUCID DREAM WAS WHEN I STARTED TO TRY AND IMPROVE MY
IT LIKE I KNOW THAT BEFORE I STARTED LUCID DREAMING MY DREAMS
18 YEARS OF LIFE THAT'S TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR DREAMS
BUT ACTUALLY I HAD TO TRAVEL TO KENYA TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT SENSE ACCORDING TO MY KNOWLEDGE AFTER 10 YEARS WHY BECAUSE
10 YEARS IN THIS INDUSTRY AND IF YOU ASK ME OR ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS INDUSTRY
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE HOTTEST TOPIC IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS WILL BE
MOBILE PAYMENT
EVERYBODY IS WORKING ON
THAT WE WILL DOMINATE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO
PAY THROUGH THEIR PHONES NOW I'VE BEEN TO KENYA
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THERE MANY PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER IT A DEVELOPING COUNTRY
REMEMBER 40 MILLION PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE
FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN KENYA HAVE A MOBILE PAYMENT
NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD ABOUT IT AND THERE ARE HALF A MILLION OR MORE APPS IN THE STORE SO
THE CHANCE IS THAT THEY FIND YOU IS RATHER RARE BUT
YOUR BUSINESS WORKS GREAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF MARKETING BUDGET SO YOU DECIDE YOU REALLY SPEND A 6 DIGIT AMOUNT
ON PROMOTING YOUR
APP LET'S ASSUME YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SMARTEST AGENCIES IN AUSTRIA
AND THEY REALLY DO AN EXCITING JOB AND
TOGETHER WITH THE CRM PROGRAM IT WORKS GREAT
NEED TO GO TO KENYA AND ASK THEM FOR CONSULTATION ON MOBILE SOLUTIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER OUR APPROACH TODAY THANK YOU
ARE ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY DEVELOPED MARKETS IN THE WORLD WE HAVE A MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION BEYOND 120
ACCOUNT FOR THEIR MOBILE PAYMENT SOLUTION VERY SMART APPROACH SO HOW DO THEY GET PEOPLE MONEY THEY SEND IT
CAN BE USED FOR EVERYBODY SO HIS SISTER CAN USE IT HIS LITTLE SISTER HIS MOM CAN USE IT HIS GRANDPA HE CAN GO TO A HOSPITAL WHICH IS OF COURSE SUBSIDIZED BUT HE GETS MEDICAL TREATMENT THERE
YEARS IN SCHOOL AND WE HAD THE WHOLE CONVERSATION IN GERMAN
BECAUSE HE SAID HE LOVES TO TALK TO TOURISTS
IMPRESSIVE
AND HE TOLD ME ALSO ABOUT IT FROM
HIM I LEARNED AND I READ IT LATER THAT ONLY 700000 PEOPLE IN KENYA
HAVE A HEALTH INSURANCE AS WE KNOW IT
WHICH MEANS 39 MILLION DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE
COOL I LIVE IN THE TOP TEN RICHEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD I CANNOT PAY EXCEPT FOR PARKING BUT IT'S A FAIR POINT
HAVE AN EXAMPLE THERE ARE THESE THREE OUTSTANDING WOMEN WHO CREATED
YEA WE TAKE THE MOST POPULAR ONE THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE OK YOU TAKE APPLE
OK IT'S OK BUT THEN YOUR MOBILE AGENCY OR DEVELOPER WILL SAY BUT WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS YOU CANNOT HAVE AN APP FOR ALL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE I MAYBE HAVE THE SURPRISING TITLE OF WHY KENYANS DO IT BETTER BUT RELAX IT'S ALL COOL IT'S
ENTIRE TIME AT THE POOL BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL ARE THESE VERY BAD PEOPLE CALLED BEACH BOYS THAT ARE JUST TRYING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING WE GOT TO KNOW SOME OF THEM
HE OBVIOUSLY WAS VERY HAPPY ABOUT GETTING THIS TEXT MESSAGE HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED DOING PHONE CALLS WHILE DRIVING THROUGH THE GREEN WHEN I ASKED HIM DURING THE BREAK WHAT HAPPENED YOU SEEM TO BE VERY HAPPY HE SAID LIKE YEAH YEAH YEAH MY DAUGHTER PASSED AN
EXAM YOU HAVE TO KNOW HE IS WORKING TWO MONTHS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK THEN HE GETS TWO WEEKS OFF
THEN HE DRIVES 800 KILOMETERS TO HIS FAMILY TO SEE THEM
I SAID THAT'S NICE SO YOUR WIFE KEEPS YOU UP TO DATE
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON HE SAID NO NO NO THE SCHOOL
AH OK SO THE TEACHER IS TEXTING YOU NO NO THE SCHOOL
I KNOW EVERYTHING IF MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T ATTEND SCHOOL I GET A TEXT MESSAGE
OK FULL STOP NOW AGAIN I'M LIVING IN ONE OF THE TOP TEN RICHEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD
I HAVE SPENT 10 YEARS IN THIS INDUSTRY
SORRY FOR THE WORDS I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
CLUE IF MY DAUGHTER GOES TO SCHOOL
HAVE ONE PROBLEM IN OUR TOP TEN RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHICH IS WE HAVE TOO MANY RESOURCES THE SCARCITY OF THE RESOURCES THERE BRINGS THE BEST OUT OF PEOPLE
BUT THE SHOP OWNERS WITH MY ORDERS CAN SET UP VIRTUAL STORES WHERE OTHER PEOPLE CAN ORDER STUFF AND TELL THEY WILL PICK IT UP AT HALF PAST FIVE WHEN THEY ARE GOING HOME
IT'S OBVIOUS BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO QUEUE UP SO YOU JUST ORDER YOU GET A BAG YOU PAY OR YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY PAID THROUGH M PESA
THAT
WORKS FINE
WHICH MEASURES THE SOIL THE WEATHER THE RAIN AND EVERYTHING
AND IF IT'S TOO DRY
GUESS WHAT HE GETS AUTOMATIC PAYMENT ON HIS MOBILE PHONE
FROM THIS INSURANCE COMPANY
NOW I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED AN AUTOMATIC PAYMENT FROM ANY INSURANCE COMPANY
BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT ONE
SAY YOUR CUSTOMERS HAVE OVER THE AVERAGE INCOME SO 50 OF YOUR CUSTOMERS HAVE AN
HOW IT IS WHEN AN ELEPHANT STANDS NEXT TO YOUR TENT DURING THE NIGHT
AND THE HUSBAND HAS THE IDEA I HAVE TO GO TO THE TOILET
BUT IT WAS REALLY GREAT
WE SAW ALL THE ANIMALS GO THERE IN JULY IT'S THE BEST TIME ALTHOUGH WE'VE SEEN THE BIG FIVE WE WERE VERY EXCITED FOR MY DAUGHTER THE MOST EXCITING
BUT TO HAVE NO LEADERSHIP SKILLS AT ALL WOULD LEAD
THROUGH IT THE STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO TRULY LEARN LEADERSHIP
DECIDED THAT MAKING A STUDENT COUNCIL WOULD BE THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WITH HELP FROM SEVERAL OF MY TEACHERS MY PARENTS
TOWARDS THE END OF GRADE 11 I MADE MY FIRST ATTEMPT TO LEADERSHIP I DECIDED THAT I WOULD CREATE THE FIRST STUDENT COUNCIL FOR STUDENTS OF MY SCHOOL I WAS FACED WITH A PROBLEM AND OF COURSE LEADERS SOLVE
THEY WOULD GO INTO COMMUNITY AND GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE
AND HOW DID THEY INSPIRED CHANGE WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY
THEY MAY ESTABLISH NEW CLUB
OR EVEN WORK TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE IN A COMMUNITY PROJECT IT IS ENTIRELY
LEAD TO CORRUPTION AND TO AN ABUSE OF POWER WHICH ISN'T LEADERSHIP AT ALL IT IS TYRANNY TO HAVE
ADMINISTRATION TO APPROVE AND IMPLEMENT THE COUNCIL IN OUR SCHOOL I
WE ALREADY KNEW I BEGUN LEARNING HOW TO BE A LEADER WHILE ESTABLISHING THE STUDENT COUNCIL SOME OF YOU MAY BE
UPON THEM
AND THEY WILL LEARN HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS
WHILE WORKING WITH OTHERS
THERE ARE THE LEADERS IN ALL OF US
AND IT'S UP TO US
TO BECAME MORE PROACTIVE
SO YOU KNOW WHAT
LET US
TO BE LEADER
WHEN I RECEIVED MY SENIOR PREFECT TITLE
I WAS TOLD I WASN'T A SUITED LEADER
I A LOT
OF MY FELLOW CLASSMATES
WAS TOLD THAT CERTAIN THINGS WERE NOW EXPECTED OF US
AND LET ME ON HAD NEW
THEY WERE QUITE A FEW OF MY PAIRS WHO DIDN'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY ALL THOSE TOOK A STEP AND OPENLY DENOUNCED ME TOLD ME I COULDN'T DO IT BUT I DID TODAY I STAND BEFORE YOU AS THE
BUT BRING IT ALL CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT
SO WHAT IF WE HAD HELP
WHAT IF WE ESTABLISH A LEADERSHIP CURRICULUM WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS
THIS LEADERSHIP CLASS WILL NOT BE AN ORDINARY CLASS WITH ORDINARY ASSIGNMENT ORDINARY EXAMS ITS
FOCUS
IS TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEADER WITHIN US
EACH OF
US CAN LEAD
NOT
AND GO THE EXTRA MILE TO HELP ME DO WELL IN THE SAME
AND INTEGRITY OF CHARACTER TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LEADER
BECAUSE THEY WILL CREATE A REPORT OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE THEY WILL TAKE INITIATIVE BECAUSE THEY DETERMINE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO INSPIRE A CHANGE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THEY WILL BECOME
DEFINES LEADERSHIP AS A POTENT COMBINATION OF STRATEGY AND CHARACTER IN THIS SENSE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT LEADERSHIP CONSIST OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO IT IS A COMBINATION OF CHARACTER
A YEAR AGO I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF BEING THE PERSON I AM TODAY CREATING THE STUDENT COUNSIL CHANGED ME I KNEW I
LEADERSHIP IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES VISION AND DIRECTION TO A PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE HOUSEHOLD TO AN ENTIRE COUNTRY SOME FORM OF LEADERSHIP IS ALWAYS PRESENT
PREFECTS HEAD BOYS HEAD GIRLS AND I KNOW THAT QUITE OFTEN YOU ARE OFTEN TOLD THAT
YOU ARE NOW SUITED LEADERS
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT LEADERSHIP IS
LEADERSHIP IS NOT POSITION
LEADERSHIP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE HANDED TO YOU
IS SOMETHING YOU COMMAND AND CAN SUMMON
LET US TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY
LET US TAKE THE FIRST STEP
LOOK TO THE PERSON TO RIGHT AT YOU AND TELL THEM I AM A LEADER GO
ON AND TELL THEM I AM A LEADER
TELL THEM
THAT I AM THE CATALYST OF CHANGE WITHIN MY COMMUNITY
WITHIN MY SOCIETY
AND
WITHIN MY COUNTRY LET
US
FOR EXAMPLE THE CLASS SHOULD BE HELD AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK WHERE STUDENTS SHOULD BE TAUGHT BASIC LEADERSHIP FUNDAMENTALS AND ABOUT INSPIRATIONAL LEADERS FOR EXAMPLE BUT THE MAIN
THEY STAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WHEREAS YOUR TEACHERS THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUR ACADEMICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY LEADERS LEAD OTHERS WHICH WE ALL KNOW ISN'T SIMPLE THING TO DO SO FOR WHAT IS WORTH I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT BEING A LEADER IS NOT EASY
AUTHORITY THAT I KNEW SHE HAD AND SHE SAID YOU'RE AN UPPITY LITTLE NIGGER AREN'T YOU
AND NOT FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOU WILL CAUSE ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO YOU SEE I'M A JUVENILE OFFENDER
TO STILL BE MAD AT YOU I'M SORRY
BUT LIKE I TELL MY GUYS
SHUT UP
SIT DOWN
PAY ATTENTION LET SOMEBODY HELP YOU
IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE I WILL PASS THIS INFORMATION ON TO YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT IT I'M NOT ALL TORE UP ABOUT
IT
RED DEVILS LIKE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT ME TO MY KNEES CRACK COCAINE LOW
BACK TO SCHOOL AND COME BACK AND BE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE TRANSITION COUNSELOR IN THE PRISONS
I WORKED AT CIW AND CRC AND NOW I'M HERE AT IRONWOOD I COME BACK TO THE PRISON NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ISSUES DON'T HAVE ISSUES I DON'T WANT NO BOYFRIEND IN THE PRISON
LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAYS TURN AROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED THAT NOBODY HAD THEIR FOOT ON MY NECK
ONE DAY I LEARNED DIFFERENT I WAS AT SCHOOL KIND OF SMART I PLAYED THE FIRST STRING VIOLIN
SO I TURNED INTO SOMETHING THAT I NEVER EVER WANT TO EVER BE AGAIN TURNED INTO A BULLY WELL I AM A BULLY I BULLY THE GUYS OVER IN THE YARD {LG}
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF I DON'T COME HERE FOR THAT I COME HERE SIMPLY TO GIVE YOU THE BEST INFORMATION THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SO YOU CAN LIVE HAPPY JOYOUS AND FREE
BECAUSE I HAD BEEN COLORED I HAD BEEN A COON I HAD BEEN DARKIE AND ON MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO THIS DAY IT SAYS NEGRO BUT IT DON'T SAY NIGGER
SO I WENT HOME AND I TOLD MY MOTHER WHAT THE TEACHER HAD CALLED ME AND THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME
I KNEW
WHAT AN INSULT FELT LIKE RUNNING AND CHASING WASN'T AN INSULT IT WAS JUST THE WAY IT WAS
SURVIVING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION THEY FIRMLY BELIEVED THERE'S ONLY ONE SURE WAY TO HAPPINESS
A SAFE AND WELL PAID JOB
IT IS NOT IMPORTANT IF I LIKE THE JOB OR NOT
BUT MY DREAM WAS TO BECOME
A CHINESE OPERA SINGER
READING ACTUALLY IS NOTHING NEW
IT'S A STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD
THERE ARE EVEN RESEARCH FIELDS SUCH AS COMPARATIVE RELIGION AND COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
COMPARE AND CONTRAST GIVES SCHOLARS A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF A TOPIC SO I THOUGHT WELL IF COMPARATIVE READING WORKS FOR RESEARCH WHY NOT DO IT IN DAILY LIFE TOO
SO I STARTED READING BOOKS IN PAIRS
A NEW CULTURE ALSO STARTED MY HABIT OF COMPARATIVE READING IT OFFERS MANY INSIGHTS FOR EXAMPLE
BOOKS HAVE GIVEN ME A MAGIC PORTAL
TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE OF THE PAST AND THE PRESENT
I KNOW I SHALL NEVER FEEL LONELY OR POWERLESS AGAIN
HAVING A DREAM SHATTERED REALLY IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT MANY OTHERS HAVE SUFFERED
I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT COMING TRUE IS NOT THE ONLY PURPOSE OF A DREAM
ITS MOST IMPORTANT PURPOSE IS TO GET US IN TOUCH WITH WHERE DREAMS COME FROM WHERE PASSION COMES FROM WHERE HAPPINESS COMES FROM EVEN A SHATTERED DREAM CAN DO THAT FOR YOU
SO BECAUSE OF BOOKS I'M HERE TODAY
HAPPY
LIVING AGAIN WITH A PURPOSE AND A CLARITY MOST OF THE TIME
WAS TRAINED TO BECOME A GYMNAST FOR TWO YEARS IN HUNAN CHINA IN THE 1970S
WOULD NEVER COME TRUE
I WAS AFRAID THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
SOME SECOND CLASS HAPPINESS WOULD BE THE BEST I COULD HOPE FOR
BUT THAT'S SO UNFAIR
SO I WAS DETERMINED
TO FIND ANOTHER CALLING
NOBODY AROUND TO TEACH ME
FINE I TURNED TO BOOKS
ADULTS LIKED THE IDEA NO ADULTS BELIEVED I WAS SERIOUS ONLY MY FRIENDS SUPPORTED ME BUT THEY WERE KIDS JUST AS POWERLESS AS I WAS
BUT STILL MANKIND IS CAUGHT LIKE A DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH UNCERTAIN INFORMATION TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN EXAMPLE
IS CERTAINLY NOT A BODILY SKILL
WHAT WE NEED IS RATHER
SOMETHING LIKE A SKILL MORE LIKE A KIND OF VIRTUE A CHARACTER TRAIT AND NOW PROBABLY FOR MANY OF YOU RED FLAGS RISE IN YOUR HEAD BECAUSE
TRAINING VIRTUES TRAINING CHARACTER TRAITS THAT SOUNDS AT BEST IMPOSSIBLE
WHILE AT WORST IT SOUNDS LIKE MANIPULATION
BUT WE DO VALUE
CHARACTER TRAITS AND VIRTUES EVEN IN OUR SOCIETY
THINK ABOUT HONESTY
WHEN YOU LOOK AT TTIP OR AT THE DIFFERENT WAYS PEOPLE REACT TO GMOS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE WHILE MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
INDICATE ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE UNCERTAIN ABOUT YOU'RE UNCERTAIN MAYBE ABOUT THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF THE CLOTHES WHETHER THE CHEMICALS ARE USED IN A SUSTAINABLE
IT NEEDS TO RESEMBLE HONESTY IT NEEDS TO BE AN ETHICAL SKILL THAT NEEDS TO TELL US
IS WORSE THE NUCLEAR ACCIDENT GLOBAL WARMING THE BLACKOUT
THEY'RE ALSO ESSENTIALLY ABOUT HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE UNCERTAINTY INTO OUR DECISION MAKING
WE'VE HAD SINCE THE 1950S PROFESSIONALS IN RISK AND UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS
AND WE'VE MADE GREAT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ADVANCES IN HOW TO DEAL WITH HOW TO UNDERSTAND AND IN HOW TO MANAGE UNCERTAINTIES
SO IS THIS OKAY YES WELL MAYBE MAYBE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT MAYBE SOME HAVE TO TAKE THE RISKS IN
SO WE SEEM TO HAVE REACHED A KIND OF DEAD END WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT WE'RE PARALYZED TO TAKE ACTION
HAD A DESIRE TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE WORLD OR BE THE CHANGE THAT I WANTED TO SEE IN THE WORLD LET'S REWIND ABOUT TEN YEARS THIS IS ME DURING
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A WEBSITE AND OF COURSE NO MEDIA WAS REPORTING ON WHAT I WAS DOING SO I CAME UP WITH A CRAZY IDEA I WAS GOING TO BIKE ACROSS THE
ANYTHING IN LIFE IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN USES ABOUT 80 TO 100 GALLONS OF WATER PER DAY THE AVERAGE EUROPEAN USES ABOUT 50 GALLONS OF WATER PER DAY
I GOT OUT OF THERE I LEARNED THE TERM FOOD DESERT AND THAT'S A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD
THE THINGS THAT WE DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS WHETHER WE REALIZE IT OR NOT AND THAT CAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL
IN BUT I THOUGHT I LIKE TO DO EXTREME THINGS
OFF JUST ONE THING A WEEK MY CHALLENGE FOR YOU IS TO TAKE OUT A PIECE OF PAPER
SEEMED LIKE IMPOSSIBLE FEATS SEEMED LIKE GIANT LEAPS WELL ONCE YOU BUILD THAT LITTLE
WAS I COULD GO DUMPSTER DIVING I
STRIPPING MY LIFE BACK TO THE ULTIMATE BASICS ONLY THEN WAS I ABLE TO START UNDERSTANDING HOW
PANELS ON THE ROOF AND ALL THESE GADGETS
BUT WHAT I LEARNED IS THAT SUSTAINABLE LIVING IS A SPECTRUM
FOR ME THE REASON I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK IS BY SIMPLIFYING MY LIFE I COULD CREATE ALL THE ELECTRICITY I NEEDED WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY BECAUSE I NEEDED LESS AND BY DOING IT THAT WAY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS ACCESSIBLE TO MANY MORE PEOPLE
RIGHT OUT OF THE NATURAL SOURCES OF WATER FOR ELECTRICITY
SURE ENOUGH IT WAS FULL OF PERFECTLY GOOD FOOD IT WAS BASICALLY A TREASURE CHEST
ME
WHEN I GOT BACK TO SAN DIEGO I CONTINUED MAKING MORE POSITIVE CHANGES
BUT I REALLY RAN INTO A BARRIER
AND THAT WAS THAT IN MY APARTMENT
ELECTRICITY CAME WHEN I TURNED THE LIGHTS ON AND WATER WAS SEEMINGLY INFINITE ON THE TAP AND I FOUND MYSELF WASTING RESOURCES SO
I DECIDED I WANTED TO DO WHAT I DID ON THE BIKE RIDE BUT DO IT IN THE CITY AND LIVE OFF THE GRID IN A
WHATSOEVER THAT WAY I'D BE LIVING SUSTAINABILITY TO THE EXTREME WHILE BRINGING THIS MESSAGE TO EVERYBODY THAT
BUT WE'LL MOVE ON SO I LIVED A NEAR ZERO WASTE LIFESTYLE AT THE TINY HOUSE AND THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF TRASH THAT I WOULD
WHAT CAN WE ALL DO AS INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE WORLD AROUND US SO I'VE GOT A CHALLENGE FOR YOU REMEMBER HOW I SAID WHEN I FIRST STARTED ALL OF THIS WHAT I DID IS MAKE A LONG LIST OF CHANGES THAT I WANTED TO
STATES ON A BAMBOO BIKE LEAVING NO IMPACT NO NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL
YOU BECOME THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD THANK YOU AND ENJOY
ONCE YOU CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN CHANGE SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AROUND YOU OVERNIGHT
COVERED IN TRASH AND I STARTED THINKING
THANKS FOR COMING OUT SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW ME AS THE GUY WHO'S DIVED INTO THOUSANDS OF GROCERY STORE DUMPSTERS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT HOW MUCH FOOD IS
MEANS I HAVE TO DO THE WORK BUT RATHER THAN MAKING A WASTE PRODUCT THAT SOMEONE HAS TO DEAL WITH IT TURNS INTO A VALUABLE RESOURCE THAT CAN BE USED TO GROW FOOD I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT POOP FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES {LG}
BELIEVE THAT OUR ACTIONS MATTER BUT NEVER DID I FEEL IT AS STRONG UNTIL THE LAST DAY OF THIS PROJECT WHEN I WAS
ON THE PHONE AND SHE TOLD ME WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T TELL ANYBODY THAT YOU'RE DUMPSTER DIVING
SO I DIDN'T FOR LITTLE WHILE BUT WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT
FOR WATER I COULD NOT USE WATER FROM ON THE GRID FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER THAT WOULD MEAN NO TAKING A SHOWER TURNING ON A FAUCET USING A FLUSH TOILET ANY OF THESE WAYS THAT
STARTED TO DO ALL OF THIS I SAID THAT I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT
ABOUT WORRYING WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU IMAGINE WEARING YOUR TRASH AROUND NEW YORK CITY FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH
NOW THESE DOCUMENTARIES AND THESE BOOKS TOLD ME THE SOLUTIONS I KNEW THAT I COULD CHANGE MY LIFE AND BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION
I STARTED SMALL
SIMPLE THINGS LIKE CARRYING A REUSABLE SHOPPING BAG TO THE GROCERY STORE INSTEAD OF THE DISPOSABLE PLASTIC ONES I
STARTED TO RIDE A BICYCLE MORE AND DRIVE THE CAR LESS I STARTED TO SHOP AT LOCAL BUSINESSES THE LOCAL FARMERS MARKET RATHER THAN THE BIG BOX CHAIN STORES
CHANGED THE FOOD I WAS PUTTING INTO MY BODY NO MORE OF THAT PACKAGED PROCESSED JUNK INSTEAD WHOLE FOODS MORE PLANT BASED FOODS FOOD THAT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR ME
AND
THE THING WAS AS
I MADE THESE CHANGES
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS TRYING TO LIVE A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY LIFE
WHICH I WAS BUT WHAT I FOUND WAS EVERY TIME THAT I DID SOMETHING THAT WAS GOOD FOR THE EARTH
IT WAS ALSO GOOD FOR ME
WITH THESE CHANGES I WAS BECOMING MUCH HAPPIER AND MUCH HEALTHIER
FIVE FEET WIDE NOT QUITE WIDE ENOUGH FOR ME TO STRETCH FULLY TEN FEET LONG SO NOT QUITE TWO OF ME LONG
ACTIONS AFFECTED THE WORLD AROUND ME I STARTED TO REALIZE HOW I WAS USING ELECTRICITY AT EVERY
IS HOW MUCH TRASH ONE PERSON CREATES IN A MONTH NOW IMAGINE ONE YEAR IMAGINE
IDEA BEHIND IT ISN'T FOR YOU TO DO EXTREME THINGS AS WELL THE IDEA IS REALLY JUST TO GET YOU TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT ALL OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES WHEN
POOP IS OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH
HOUSE I WENT ONTO CRAIGSLIST AND I HAPPENED TO FIND ONE ONLINE AND IT SAID IT WAS 950 DOLLARS I THOUGHT SURELY THAT MUST BE A TYPO I MEAN THAT'S LESS THAN A
IN ORDER TO DO THAT I HAD TO SET BASIC GROUND RULES FOR ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABLE LIVING FOOD WATER ENERGY WASTE
MY CAR MAKING SURE THAT IT LOOKED AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE AND MY GOAL WAS TO BE MILLIONAIRE BY THE TIME THAT I WAS 30 YEARS OLD
THESE WERE MY FOCUSES IN LIFE
BUT THE THING WAS AT THIS TIME I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT I WAS SORT OF LIVING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY LIFE AND THE REASON WHY IS I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS RECYCLING THE BEER CANS AND THE BEER BOTTLES AFTER ALL OUR PARTIES
I WAS THE ONE WHO WHEN RICKY HAD HIS FAUCET RUNNING WHILE HE WAS BRUSHING HIS TEETH I WAS THE ONE TELLING HIM SHUT THAT FAUCET OFF RICKY AND I WAS THE ONE WHO PUT IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENT BULBS AT THE HOUSE SO
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS DOING PRETTY GOOD
BUT
{NS} I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT AS INDIVIDUALS
THEIR LIVES WITH US IT'S REALLY A GIFT AND I HOPE WE CAN ALL GO OUT AFTER THIS IS OVER AND SHARE IT WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
ISSUE AS HEALTH CARE OR THE ECONOMY OR THE MIDDLE EAST
FINALLY I RETIRED ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO AND I
BUT GUESS WHAT THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT ENJOY THAT BENEFIT TIME AND
FOUR MY FAMILY MOVED FROM THE BRONX WHICH WAS CITY TO LONG ISLAND WHICH AT THE TIME WAS A GROWING SUBURB
MY DAD WAS A LAWYER HE DID INSURANCE WORK AND NEGLIGENCE WORK BY DAY BUT AT NIGHT HE WAS A MEMBER OF CORE CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY THE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION
AT THE TIME LONG ISLAND WAS BOOMING BECAUSE ALL THESE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES WERE MOVING FROM THE CITY TO PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP
BUT AS PEOPLE HERE KNOW WE DON'T ALWAYS CHART OUR CAREERS PERFECTLY AND I BECAME A BUSINESS REPORTER
THAT'S WHERE THE JOBS WERE AT THE TIME I WORKED HARD AND I DID FINE AND EVENTUALLY I WENT TO WALL STREET I BECAME A FINANCIAL ANALYST AND THEN A HEDGE FUND MANAGER
AND FOR 15 OR 20 YEARS I
ARE THINGS IF YOU'RE PHILANTHROPIST YOU'VE SEEN SO MANY AMAZING ORGANIZATIONS PEOPLE WORKING WITH THE INCARCERATED THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED
SAFETY IS CRITICAL WE DO NEED A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OURS IS BROKEN I DON'T NEED TO CONVINCE ANYBODY OF THAT SO I WANT TO TALK
PEOPLE FOUND THAT BLACK FAMILIES WERE BEING TURNED DOWN WHEN THEY WANTED TO BUY A HOME SO MY DAD TEAMED UP WITH A REPORTER FROM NEWSDAY ONE OF THE LOCAL PAPERS THEY WOULD POSE AS A COUPLE
SENSE OF EMBARRASSMENT AND PRIDE SIMULTANEOUSLY AS A KID CAN
THE THINGS WE INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR TODAY THAT 30 40 50 60 YEARS AGO WE DIDN'T DRUG ADDICTION IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE MENTAL HEALTH ALCOHOL ADDICTION KIDS GETTING INTO FIGHTS AT SCHOOL NOW WE HAVE POLICE AND THEY'RE GOING FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE
HE BROUGHT THESE PEOPLE WITH PICKETS THERE WERE BIG SIGNS AND THEY WERE LOUD AND THEY WERE MULTIRACIAL NEEDLESS TO SAY OUR NEIGHBORS DID NOT RECEIVE THESE PEOPLE WITH OPEN ARMS I REMEMBER
A HOME AND THEN A BLACK COUPLE WOULD FOLLOW THEM OR PRECEDE THEM GOING TO THE SAME BUILDER OR
RECEPTION OF MOSTLY THE BLACK KIDS IN THESE WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS WAS VICIOUS THERE
THAT'S ALMOST CLICHE WE CAN SEE ON A POSTER BUT IF WE JUST PAUSE AND THINK ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES AND PEOPLE WE
IF YOU WEREN'T THIS MORNING BY THIS AFTERNOON WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE DEEPLY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BUT
JUSTICE REFORM WHICH BASICALLY UNTIL VERY RECENTLY WAS NEVER DISCUSSED POLITICALLY
TO MY DAD HE'S 85 YEARS OLD NOW HE LIVES IN TUCSON ARIZONA AND SINCE LEAVING CORE IN THE 1960S HE'S NEVER STOPPED
DOING REPORTING THAT NEED OUR SUPPORT IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER AND YOU HIRE A FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSON YOU ARE CHANGING A
25 YEARS EARLIER WHAT I LEARNED WOULD COME AS NEWS TO NOBODY IN THIS ROOM BUT SOME OF IT DOES BEAR REPEATING ONE OF THE REAL TAKEAWAYS I'VE
WE HAVE A LOT OF WRITING FROM INCARCERATED PEOPLE I HAVE TO PAUSE HERE BECAUSE YESTERDAY OUR EDITOR BILL KELLER AND KELLI PAYNE PEOPLE FROM OUR STAFF VISITED WITH THE SAN QUENTIN NEWS I DON'T REALLY FEEL I NEED TO JUSTIFY THE MARSHALL PROJECT OR JUSTIFY JOURNALISM BUT MEETING WITH THAT TEAM OF MEN WHO ARE PEERS AND WHO DEBATED WITH US AND WE EXCHANGED IDEAS WAS SO AMAZING BECAUSE I THINK IN A MICROCOSM WHAT THE SAN QUENTIN
WAY IT'S AN AFFIRMATION FOR WHAT WE'RE ALL DOING AND I MEAN EVERY ONE OF
AND SAID WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG BUT I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING RIGHT EITHER
I'D GONE
ON NICE VACATIONS I HAD RAISED A FAMILY I'D BECOME BASICALLY AN AVERAGE AMERICAN A TYPICAL AMERICAN IN MANY WAYS BUT I FELT THERE WERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE ME
WHO IF THEY COULD LEARN AND KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WOULD CARE
GOING
BACK THE POWER OF JOURNALISM I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN THE POWER OF REPORTING THE POWER OF STORYTELLING
THE OPENING STATEMENT WHICH HAS BECOME INDISPENSABLE FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE PROFESSIONAL IN THE FIELD AND WE HAVE A SECTION CALLED LIFE INSIDE A WEEKLY COLUMN WRITTEN ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE
SO EXPOSURE TRANSPIRED AND THERE WERE ARTICLES WRITTEN AND A LOT OF GOOD WAS DONE I THINK THE FAIR HOUSING ACT WAS PASSED IN 1968 IN PART BECAUSE OF THINGS MY DAD AND OTHERS DID AND THESE KINDS OF
PROJECT BELIEVES THAT PART OF THE SOLUTION IS SHINING A LIGHT IS SETTING A SPARK AND LIGHTING A FIRE AND LETTING ALL YOU GUYS DO ALL THE OTHER
THAT I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO EVERYONE HERE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO LISTEN TO EVERYONE HERE IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING DAY
THAT ALSO HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON THE WAY CONGRESS AND THE NORTH SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE SOUTH JOURNALISM TO ME IS
LAUNCHED ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE MARSHALL PROJECT IS NONPROFIT JOURNALISM ORGANIZATION WE RELY ON THE SUPPORT OF FOUNDATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS
HOW WE OUGHT TO CHANGE IT AND I DEEPLY BELIEVE THAT BUT I DON'T FEEL THE NEED AT THIS MOMENT TO REPEAT THAT ALTHOUGH I HOPE MY COMMENTS UNDERSCORE WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID BEFORE
NO VIOLENCE BUT THEY TURNED ON HER AND CALLED HER A NIGGER LOVER ON CAMERA THEN THERE WAS JUST SILENCE WE TURNED THIS INTO A DOCUMENTARY FILM AND DISTRIBUTED IT WE WERE KIDS BUT IT WAS ANOTHER STEP ALONG THE WAY
WHAT I WAS WITNESSING BUT TODAY LOOKING BACK I REALIZE HOW FORTUNATE I WAS THAT ONE OF MY ROLE MODELS WAS ACTING OUT OF COURAGE RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES I
BEHIND BARS VAST LAWS STILL NEED TO BE CHANGED OUR WORK IS ONLY BEGINNING SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ALL OF US HERE
RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND HOW CRITICAL IT WAS THAT YOU HAD REPORTERS ON THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE IN SELMA IN 1965 AS THE DEMONSTRATORS WERE COMING OVER THE BRIDGE AND GETTING THEIR REAR
IN OUR COUNTRY FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS HAS BEEN TO THROW PEOPLE BEHIND BARS
THERE'S COMPLICATED REASONS FOR THIS AND THEY'RE VERY HARD TO SOLVE
PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM PEOPLE SMARTER THAN I BEFORE ME AND HOPEFULLY AFTER WILL ADDRESS SOME OF
THAT I REALIZED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE REALITY WHICH WAS BAD ENOUGH
BUT THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF NATIONAL URGENCY
WHERE IS THE OUTCRY ON A DAILY BASIS THEN I LOOKED IN THE
WITH VIDEOCAMERAS TO FILM WE WENT TO ROXBURY A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD AND TALKED TO BLACK KIDS WE WENT TO SOUTH BOSTON AND TALKED
TO WHITE KIDS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I SAW NAKED BIGOTRY
AND RAW IGNORANCE AT ONE POINT ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID TO THE KIDS AND THEY WERE SPEWING RACIAL EPITHETS BEFORE BUSING HAD YOU EVER MET A BLACK PERSON
SO MY OWN BACKGROUND HOW DID I GET HERE AND HOW DID I BECOME A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMER
HAD PLANNED ON TALKING IN PART ABOUT HOW ROTTEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS
DO INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT PRISON CONDITIONS OR JUVENILE JUSTICE OR IMMIGRATION OR THE DEATH PENALTY
GENERATION OF KIDS WILL HAVE A HUGE
GLOBAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT IF WE DON'T FIND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS
WHAT IS AUTISM
MUCH OF WHAT AUTISM IS ARE IMPAIRMENTS IN ABILITIES THAT YOU AND I TAKE FOR GRANTED IN OUR DAILY LIVES
WE ARE ABLE TO MANOEUVER AND UNDERSTAND OUR SOCIAL WORLD WE ARE ABLE TO GREET FRIENDS SAY HELLO LOOK THEM IN AN EYE SHAKE THEIR HAND
THESE NATURAL SOCIAL ABILITIES ARE DIFFICULT OR EVEN LOST IN PEOPLE WITH
TECHNIQUES LIKE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING MRI WE CAN USE IT AS A GUIDE OF WHEN AND WHERE TO LOOK IN THE BRAIN FOR CLUES ABOUT WHAT MAY BE HAPPENING AT THE BROADER LEVEL
THAN 150 BRAINS HAVE EVER BEEN STUDIED
THINK OF THAT IN TERMS OF
COMPARING IT TO ALZHEIMER'S OR PARKINSON'S DISEASE WHERE THOUSANDS OF BRAINS ARE AVAILABLE
OR IN SCHIZOPHRENIA WHERE HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN STUDIED THIS HAS LED TO GREAT ADVANCES
IN
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE DISORDERS AND OUR ABILITY TO FIND BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS
BUT IN AUTISM WE ARE AT A CRISIS IT IS NOT A MONEY ISSUE
A PERSONNEL OR LACK OF KNOW HOW WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE TISSUE TO STUDY
BUT THERE IS A SOLUTION
I AM ASKING YOU
TO HELP SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
BRAIN DONATION
IT IS MY JOB TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THAT BRAIN TISSUE TO THE SCIENTISTS LIKE MYSELF
WHO NEED IT
AUTISM THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE VERY LITTLE BRAIN TISSUE TO STUDY WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH IN FACT WE ARE
OF WHAT
HAS HAPPENED IN THE BRAIN OR IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING SO WE NEED TO GO DEEPER TO UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS IN ORDER TO GET TO THOSE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS
WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN THE LAST 10 YEARS WITH
THE BEARS PROGRAM IS TO
SHARE BRAIN TISSUE WITH RESEARCHERS AROUND THE WORLD THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS IS IF WE SHARE
TO MAKE BRAIN RESEARCH
ON AUTISM
POSSIBLE
DONATING YOUR BRAIN IS SOMETHING MANY OF US HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED
YOU THINK NOTHING OF CHECKING THAT BOX AT THE DMV TO SAY I AM AN ORGAN DONOR
YOU CAN
EASILY IMAGINE HOW DONATING YOUR
HEART OR YOUR KIDNEY CAN GO TO SAVE ONE PERSON'S LIFE
BUT IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW DONATING YOUR BRAIN
COULD GO TO CHANGE
IMPACT MILLIONS AND PROBABLY BILLIONS
OF PEOPLE'S LIVES
THROUGH SCIENCE
AND RESEARCH
YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING WILL MY BRAIN HELP THE ANSWER IS YES YOUR BRAIN WILL HELP
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
LOOK AT A BRAIN AND SAY THAT PERSON HAD AUTISM DURING LIFE
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TYPICALLY DEVELOPING BRAIN TO COMPARE IT TO SO YES
YOUR BRAIN WILL HELP
IT IS A DIFFICULT
DISCUSSION TO HAVE
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IT THE BLANK LOOK THEY GET ON THEIR FACE WHEN THEY ASK ME WHAT DO YOU DO I SAY I DO BRAIN DONATION FOR AUTISM RESEARCH
IT IS A REALLY DIFFICULT TOPIC TO DISCUSS
I CAME INTO THIS THINKING OH MY GOD I HAVE GOT TO CONVINCE
FAMILIES THAT HAVE JUST LOST A LOVED ONE TO DONATE
THEIR CHILD'S BRAIN I CAN'T IMAGE ANYTHING WORSE WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT I HAVE TWO LITTLE GIRLS I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT
YET I CAN TELL YOU THAT
I HAVE NEVER ONCE HAD TO DO THAT
EVERY TIME I HAVE BEEN TOLD
THANK YOU
YOU HELPED US THROUGH OUR GRIEF
KNOWING THAT OUR CHILD WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS WORLD
I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE WORDS OF A
MOM
FROM OUR FIRST DONOR HIS NAME WAS GREYSON
HE PASSED AWAY FROM A SEIZURE
WHEN HE WAS 16
HE HAD AUTISM
DURING HER TIME OF GRIEF SHE THOUGHT
WHAT COULD WE DO
WHAT COULD WE DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
SO THAT OTHER PARENTS AND CHILDREN
DON'T HAVE TO
DONOR AND HELP US CHANGE THE COURSE OF AUTISM RESEARCH THANK YOU
OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR TREATMENT ACROSS ONE'S LIFESPAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY SOMETHING IS LARGER OR SMALLER IN THE BRAIN WHAT DOES THAT TELL US WE NEED TO GO DEEPER THIS IS WHAT YOUR BRAIN LOOKS
TELLS US IT'S THE GROWTH TRAJECTORY OF THE BRAIN IT'S THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS LIFESPAN THAT ARE DIFFERENT IN AUTISM THE GOOD THING IS THIS DOES OPEN UP A
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT IT IS THAT I WORK TOWARD WHAT MY PASSION IS THAT'S MAKING
BRAIN RESEARCH ON AUTISM POSSIBLE
WE HAVE NO BIOLOGICAL TEST FOR AUTISM
IT IS A BEHAVIOURALLY DEFINED DISORDER WE KNOW IT IS A DISORDER OF THE BRAIN
BUT IT IS A BEHAVIOURALLY DEFINED DISORDER IN WHICH WE HAVE VERY FEW BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS TO OFFER
MY RESEARCH AS A NEUROSCIENTIST IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVEL WHAT ROLE GENES ARE PLAYING
AND HOW IT IS THAT THE BRAIN IS DEVIATING FROM THAT OF TYPICAL CHILD
THIS INFORMATION IS NECESSARY FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS CAUSING THE DISORDER
AND HOW WE CAN TREAT
IT WHAT AM GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT TODAY IS WHY
BRAIN DONATION
THAT'S RIGHT I SAID BRAIN DONATION
POST MORTEM BRAIN TISSUE
IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL
FOR US TO FIND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR AUTISM
IT'S REALLY HEART BREAKING WHEN YOU HEAR FROM A PARENT
THAT THEIR CHILD WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM
YOU WANT TO JUST WRAP YOUR ARMS AROUND THEM AND SAY I AM SO
SORRY
AUTISM CAME TO MY FAMILY IN 1999
AT WHICH TIME WE WERE TOLD
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY MEDICATIONS TO OFFER YOU I'M SORRY
14 YEARS LATER
THERE STILL ARE NO MEDICATIONS
TO OFFER
BUT ONE DAY BECAUSE OF BRAIN RESEARCH WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
THERE IS A TREATMENT FOR THAT
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO CARE
MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN OUR COUNTRY ALONE
WITH
AUTISM
IT'S BEEN CALLED AN EPIDEMIC
WITH PREVALENCE RATES RAPIDLY RISING
YET AS SCIENTISTS WE ENVISION ONE DAY HAVING TAILORED BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE
ON MESSAGE IS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BRAIN
YOU HAVE TO STUDY
THE BRAIN IN FACT WE HAVE DONE THAT
IN BRAIN TISSUE WE HAVE LOOKED AT AND MAPPED HOW SOME GROUPS OF GENES ARE
FUNCTIONING IF YOU THINK OF THEM AT A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTIVATION IN GREEN AND AT LOW LEVEL OF ACTIVATION IN RED WE SEE THAT IN FACT THEY ARE FUNCTIONING DIFFERENTLY IN AUTISM
BUT WE WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THIS HAD WE ONLY LOOKED IN THE BLOOD
HOPEFULLY I HAVE CONVINCED YOU THAT BRAIN TISSUE IS NECESSARY FOR US TO
THIS SHOWS YOU IS AUTISM IS COMPLICATED IT IS
EACH ONE OF US HAS A UNIQUE VOICEPRINT THAT REFLECTS OUR AGE OUR SIZE
PROBABLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID BUT I HOPE THAT YOU HEARD THEIR UNIQUE VOCAL IDENTITIES
ALL WE NEED
IS A FEW HOURS OF SPEECH FROM OUR SURROGATE TALKER AND AS LITTLE AS A VOWEL
FROM OUR TARGET TALKER TO CREATE A UNIQUE VOCAL IDENTITY
SO THAT'S THE SCIENCE BEHIND WHAT WE'RE DOING
NOW I TOLD YOU EARLIER THAT I'D SPENT A GOOD PART OF MY CAREER UNDERSTANDING AND STUDYING THE SOURCE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WITH SEVERE SPEECH DISORDER AND WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEIR FILTERS WERE
NEED TO GIVE YOU A REAL QUICK SPEECH SCIENCE LESSON OKAY SO FIRST
DONORS IN WHATEVER WAY TO MAKE THIS VISION A REALITY THEY SAY THAT GIVING BLOOD CAN SAVE LIVES WELL GIVING YOUR VOICE CAN CHANGE
GOING TO PLAY YOU NOW A SAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS TWO PEOPLE ACTUALLY WHO HAVE SEVERE SPEECH DISORDERS I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN TO HOW THEY SOUND THEY'RE SAYING THE SAME UTTERANCE
CALLED PROSODY AND I'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING FOR YEARS THAT THE PROSODIC ABILITIES OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE PRESERVED SO WHEN I REALIZED THAT THOSE SAME CUES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR SPEAKER IDENTITY I HAD THIS
SIX SHE CALLS IT MIXING COLORS TO PAINT VOICES
IMAGINE CARRYING AROUND SOMEONE ELSE'S VOICE FOR NINE
HAD TO FIND A SURROGATE DONOR AND THEN WE HAD TO HAVE SAMANTHA PRODUCE SOME UTTERANCES WHAT SHE CAN PRODUCE ARE MOSTLY VOWEL LIKE SOUNDS BUT THAT'S ENOUGH FOR US TO EXTRACT HER SOURCE CHARACTERISTICS
TO FIND SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO BE SURROGATE IT'S NOT SUCH AN OMINOUS THING BEING A SURROGATE DONOR ONLY REQUIRES YOU TO SAY A FEW HUNDRED TO A FEW THOUSAND UTTERANCES THE PROCESS GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS
NOW THERE'S MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD LIKE SAMANTHA MILLIONS AND WE'VE ONLY BEGUN TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF PRE RECORDED SAMPLES OF SPEECH FOR THOSE BORN WITH SPEECH DISORDER BUT I THOUGHT THERE HAD TO BE A WAY TO REVERSE ENGINEER VOICE FROM WHATEVER LITTLE IS LEFT OVER SO WE DECIDED TO DO
I WANTED TO DO NEXT IS I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW WE COULD HARNESS THESE RESIDUAL VOCAL ABILITIES AND BUILD A TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE CUSTOMIZED FOR THEM VOICES THAT COULD BE CUSTOMIZED FOR THEM
SO I REACHED OUT TO MY COLLABORATOR TIM BUNNELL DR BUNNELL IS AN EXPERT IN SPEECH SYNTHESIS
AND WHAT HE'D BEEN DOING IS BUILDING PERSONALIZED VOICES FOR PEOPLE
BY
TYPING A MESSAGE ON HIS DEVICE I WONDERED WHAT WAS HE THINKING
LIKE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT A POWERFUL AND FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF WHO WE ARE OUR VOICE
SAY THAT FISH THROUGH THAT DATABASE AND FIND ALL THE SEGMENTS NECESSARY TO SAY THAT UTTERANCE {NS}
VOICES THAT DIDN'T FIT THEIR BODIES OR THEIR PERSONALITIES WE WOULDN'T DREAM OF FITTING A LITTLE GIRL WITH THE PROSTHETIC LIMB OF A GROWN MAN SO WHY THEN THE SAME PROSTHETIC
FINALLY INTO THE REAL WORLD SO IT CAN HAVE REAL WORLD IMPACT WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU NEXT IS HOW I ENVISION TAKING THIS WORK TO THAT NEXT LEVEL
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE GENTLE SMILE THAT SPREAD ACROSS HER FACE WHEN SHE HEARD THAT VOICE FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND FINALLY FINDING YOUR OWN VOICE IMAGINE THAT THIS IS WHAT WILLIAM SAID
OUR FIRST FEW PERSONALIZED VOICES BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE
CUSTOM CRAFTED VOICES THAT CAPTURED THEIR UNIQUE VOCAL IDENTITIES WE CALL THIS PROJECT VOCALID OR VOCAL I D FOR VOCAL
NOW THAT'S MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE
WHO ARE USING GENERIC VOICES INCLUDING PROFESSOR HAWKING WHO USES
AN AMERICAN ACCENTED VOICE
THIS LACK OF INDIVIDUATION OF THE SYNTHETIC VOICE REALLY HIT HOME
WHEN I WAS AT AN ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE A FEW YEARS AGO
THEY ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN NEED TO BELONG AND TO IDENTIFY WITH A GROUP OF OTHERS JUST LIKE US WHETHER IT'S A
HUMAN LIFESTYLE DRASTICALLY FOR IT MAKES US CREATE
THOUGH THE COMMON DISMISSAL IS THAT ANY INTEREST IN FASHION DEMONSTRATES A PERSON'S INNER ABSORPTION WITH SUPERFICIALITY CLOTHES EXPRESS A KIND OF
WITH THEIR EARNED REPUTATION FOR COMPLIMENTING THE HUMAN FORM VOLUMINOUS STRUCTURE AN OUTLET FOR SELF EXPRESSION AND A SOURCE OF CULTURAL IDENTITY
THE CONVERGENCE OF FASHION AND ARCHITECTURE
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SWAY PEOPLE'S THINKING CHANGE THEIR ACTIONS AND ULTIMATELY CAUSE THEIR REACTIONS
IN WHICH WE CARRY OURSELVES IN SOCIETY TODAY WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH OUR
INCAPABLE OF BEING FRANKLY VOCALIZED BY THE WEARER
INNOVATIVE WORLD WE ARE NO LONGER JUST WEARING OUR CLOTHING WE ARE INHABITING IT THANK YOU
OUR PERSPECTIVES IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE CARRY OURSELVES IN SOCIETY TODAY
IT'S ULTIMATELY NOT ABOUT A PRICE TAG OR SPECIFIC DESIGNER ANYMORE
BUT HOW WE VIEW FASHION HOW WE INTERPRET IT AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND ITS UNIVERSAL IMPACT
IN STRIVING FOR A MORE CREATIVE CUTTING
AND SOCIETAL COMPONENTS OF A COMMUNITY
DEPICT POP CULTURE FOR THEY CAN BOTH FREEZE MOMENTS IN TIME THAT REFLECT ON THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ENTITIES OF A SOCIETY AS TIME HAS PROGRESSED IT HAS BECOME
A WHOLE NEW WORLD WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A STRUCTURE IN A WAY FASHION AND
ABOUT US INTENTIONAL OR NOT EVEN TO THOSE WE DON'T SPEAK TO
GREATER IMPACT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAN JUST FORM AND FUNCTION FASHION IS BEGINNING TO
TO PERCEIVE THE UNDERLYING MEANING BEHIND EACH DESIGN REALM
THOUGH FASHION AND ARCHITECTURE CLEARLY AIM TO IDENTIFY CERTAIN CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL IDENTITIES
THEY ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT OUR EMOTIONAL WELLBEING THINK
OF IT THIS WAY
FASHION REFERS TO THE ARTICLES ONE WEARS BUT STYLE IS HOW YOU PUT IT TOGETHER AND HOW CONFIDENT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GO ABOUT YOUR
THAT FASHION AND ARCHITECTURE HAVE BECOME A MEANS OF REPRESENTATION AND COMMUNICATION OF A CULTURAL IDENTITY RATHER THAN SIMPLY A PROTECTIVE COVERING FOR HUMAN BEINGS
IN EXPRESSING THE CREATIVE ENERGY
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOCALIZE THEMSELVES
HOWEVER I'VE OFTEN FELT THAT FASHION IS RATHER UNFAIRLY DISREGARDED BY MOST AS SOME FORM OF SHALLOW OR EVEN VAIN DESIGN DISCIPLINE
OBJECTS MADE SOLELY FOR THE VIEWING PLEASURE OF THE ELITE
HOWEVER THE MORE WE EXPLORE THIS INTRICATE AND COMPLEX WORLD THE MORE WE REALIZE THAT FASHION IS THE VAST EXPLORATION OF HUMANITY AND THE HUMAN FORM
THESE
TAKES CUES FROM THINGS WHICH ARE AUDIAL OR SOMETHING IF THAT'S A WORD AND SO
TWO GRAMMYS FOR A RECORD THAT YOU MADE IN YOUR ROOM BY YOURSELF AND HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT THAT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO EVEN JC
TRY AND TOUR THE ROOM ON THE ROAD AND THAT'S QUITE A STRANGE IDEA BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR COUPLE OF YEARS AND
YOU GUYS WHO KNOW THIS ALREADY BUT IT'S SOMEBODY WITH A GOOD IDEA WHO CAN SOW THAT SEED THAT'S THE PERSON WHO CARRIES THE TORCH INTO THE WORLD AND YEAH I MADE THIS ALBUM COMPLETELY ON MY OWN AND I DIDN'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO SAY HEY JACOB YOU SHOULD MAKE AN
NEW WORLD THE POWER IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE CREATOR AS I'M SURE YOU
FRAMEWORKS BUT WITHOUT THE NEED TO PUT THINGS INTO WORDS
AND I THINK THAT AS WITH MANY OTHER LANGUAGES IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT A LANGUAGE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY WORDS YOU CAN SAY HOW MANY PHRASES YOU KNOW WHAT MATTERS IS THE EMOTIONAL CHOICES
YOU MAKE WITH THIS LANGUAGE SO I ENCOURAGE US
I HAD A FAMILY WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO INVEST IN MY OWN IMAGINATION AND SO THINGS I CREATED THINGS I BUILT WERE GOOD THINGS TO BE BUILDING
LONDON AND THIS ROOM I MEAN THIS IS MY FAMILY HOME I GREW UP IN THIS ROOM FILLED WITH MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BUT MOST
AS THE TEAR SILENTLY SEEPS FROM MY EYE I STOP TO THINK AND ASK WHY DO I CRY CAN IT BE FOR ME
FINDS THE WORDS WELL SEE FOR ME POETRY IS LIKE A VOICE SEE WHEN THERE'S A DAM THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU WHERE YOU CAN'T EXPRESS HOW YOU FEEL AND YOU JUST WANT TO TELL THE WORLD SO MANY
I CRY TO BE FREE
THEIR STORIES ARE NOT ONE SIDED OR SILENT IT SPEAKS TO THE WORLD OF
SEE LOTS OF POVERTY
AND IT'S QUITE JARRING
BOTH IN THE SCALE AND THE SCOPE OF IT
MY FIRST TRIP IN INDIA I WAS IN PERSON'S HOME WHERE THEY HAD DIRT FLOORS NO RUNNING WATER NO ELECTRICITY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I SEE ALL OVER THE WORLD
SO IN SHORT I'M STARTLED BY ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE
TOO LATE TO USE THE DATA
I HAD SOMEBODY FROM AN NGO ONCE DESCRIBE IT TO ME AS BOWLING IN THE DARK THEY SAID YOU ROLL THE BALL YOU HEAR SOME PINS GO DOWN IT'S DARK YOU CAN'T SEE WHICH ONE GOES DOWN UNTIL THE LIGHTS COME ON AND THEN YOU AN SEE YOUR IMPACT
REAL TIME DATA
TURNS ON THE LIGHTS
SO WHAT'S THE SECOND THING THAT COKE'S GOOD AT
THEY'RE GOOD AT TAPPING INTO THAT LOCAL ENTREPRENEURIAL TALENT
OF PARALYSIS TO A TARGETED VACCINATION PROGRAM AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THAT AREA GOT POLIO
HOW THIS CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES
HEALTH EXTENSION WORKERS CAN HELP WITH SO MANY THINGS WHETHER IT'S FAMILY PLANNING PRENATAL CARE IMMUNIZATIONS FOR THE CHILDREN OR ADVISING THE WOMAN TO GET TO THE FACILITY ON TIME FOR AN ON TIME DELIVERY
THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH SO THEY WENT TO INDIA AND STUDIED THE INDIAN STATE OF KERALA THAT ALSO HAD A SYSTEM LIKE THIS AND THEY ADAPTED IT FOR ETHIOPIA AND IN
15TH THEY TOOK A STOOL SAMPLE AND BY THE 25TH OF AUGUST IT WAS CONFIRMED HE HAD TYPE 1 POLIO
BY AUGUST 30TH A GENETIC TEST WAS DONE AND WE KNEW WHAT STRAIN OF POLIO SHRIRAM HAD
NOW IT COULD HAVE COME FROM ONE OF TWO PLACES IT COULD HAVE COME
FEEDBACK LOOP THEY LEARN SOMETHING THEY PUT IT BACK INTO THE PRODUCT THEY PUT IT BACK INTO THE MARKET THEY HAVE A WHOLE TEAM CALLED KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHT IT'S LOT LIKE OTHER CONSUMER COMPANIES
SO IF YOU'RE RUNNING NAMIBIA FOR COCA COLA AND YOU HAVE A 107 CONSTITUENCIES YOU KNOW WHERE EVERY CAN VERSUS BOTTLE OF SPRITE FANTA OR COKE WAS SOLD WHETHER IT WAS CORNER STORE A SUPERMARKET OR A PUSHCART
SO IF SALES START TO DROP THEN THE PERSON CAN IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE
COMING DOWN 25 PERCENT FROM 2000 TO 2008
IN ETHIOPIA THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN LIVING BECAUSE OF THIS HEALTH EXTENSION WORKER PROGRAM
SO WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP FOR ETHIOPIA WELL THEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TALK ABOUT THIS THEY'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT HOW DO YOU HAVE THE HEALTH COMMUNITY WORKERS GENERATE THEIR OWN IDEAS HOW DO YOU INCENT THEM BASED ON THE IMPACT THAT THEY'RE GETTING OUT IN THOSE REMOTE VILLAGES
THAT'S HOW YOU TAP INTO LOCAL ENTREPRENEURIAL TALENT AND YOU UNLOCK PEOPLE'S POTENTIAL
SOUND ANYTHING LIKE WAVIN' FLAG TO ME AND
I THINK WE MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKE WE MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE THINK THAT IF PEOPLE NEED SOMETHING
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THEM WANT THAT
AND I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE
AND THERE'S SOME INDICATIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT THIS IS
WE'VE COME
AND HOW AMAZING IT WOULD BE TO ERADICATE THIS DISEASE
WE COULD PUT POLIO FATIGUE AND POLIO BEHIND US
AND IF WE COULD DO THAT WE COULD STOP VACCINATING EVERYBODY WORLDWIDE IN ALL OF OUR COUNTRIES FOR POLIO
AND IT WOULD ONLY BE THE SECOND DISEASE EVER WIPED OFF THE FACE OF THE PLANET
AND WE ARE SO CLOSE AND THIS VICTORY IS SO POSSIBLE
AFRICA THEY ASSOCIATE HAPPINESS WITH SERITI OR COMMUNITY RESPECT NOW THAT PLAYED ITSELF OUT IN THE WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN LET'S LISTEN TO THIS SONG THAT COKE CREATED FOR IT WAVIN' FLAG BY A SOMALI HIP HOP ARTIST
IS THAT PEOPLE WANT A COCA COLA NOW THE
WITH THE COMMUNITY YOU START TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHY OPEN DEFECATION IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE DONE IN THE VILLAGE AND THEY AGREE TO THAT
BUT THEN YOU TAKE THE TOILET AND YOU POSITION IT AS MODERN TRENDY CONVENIENCE
ONE STATE IN NORTHERN INDIA HAS GONE SO FAR AS TO LINK TOILETS
SMALL LOANS THEY SET THEM UP AS WHAT THEY CALLED MICRO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS
AND THOSE LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS THEN HIRE SALES PEOPLE WHO GO OUT WITH BICYCLES AND PUSHCARTS AND WHEELBARROWS TO SELL THE PRODUCT
THERE NOW SOME 3000 OF THESE CENTERS EMPLOYING ABOUT 15000 PEOPLE IN AFRICA
A LARGE TRUCK ROLLING DOWN THE STREET AND IN AFRICA THE REMOTE PLACES IT'S HARD TO FIND A GOOD ROAD BUT COKE NOTICED
ON THE GROUND IT'S NOT TELLING THE PARENTS IF YOU SEE PARALYSIS TAKE YOUR CHILD TO THE DOCTOR OR GET YOUR CHILD VACCINATED
WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MARKETING IN THE DONOR COMMUNITY THE G8 NATIONS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY GENEROUS ON POLIO OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS BUT WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE SOMETHING CALLED POLIO FATIGUE AND THAT IS THAT THE DONOR NATIONS AREN'T WILLING TO FUND POLIO ANY LONGER SO BY NEXT SUMMER WE'RE SIGHTED TO RUN OUT OF MONEY ON POLIO
SO WE ARE
WHEN I MEET THE MOTHERS IN SO MANY OF THESE REMOTE PLACES I'M REALLY STRUCK BY THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON THEY WANT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR CHILDREN
IF YOU THINK ABOUT COCA COLA
THEY SELL 1 5 BILLION SERVINGS EVERY SINGLE DAY
THAT'S LIKE EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD ON THE PLANET HAVING SERVING OF COKE EVERY WEEK
SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER
WELL IF WE'RE GOING TO SPEED UP THE PROGRESS AND GO EVEN FASTER ON THE SET OF MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS THAT WE'RE SET AS A WORLD
WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THE INNOVATORS
AND THOSE INNOVATORS COME FROM EVERY SINGLE SECTOR
I FEEL THAT IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES SOMETHING LIKE COCA COLA UBIQUITOUS
WE CAN APPLY THOSE LESSONS THEN FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
COKE'S SUCCESS IS RELEVANT BECAUSE IF WE CAN ANALYZE IT LEARN FROM IT
THEN WE CAN SAVE LIVES
SO THAT'S WHY I TOOK BIT OF TIME TO STUDY COKE
AND I THINK THERE ARE REALLY THREE THINGS WE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM COCA COLA
THEY TAKE REAL TIME DATA AND IMMEDIATELY FEED IT BACK INTO THE PRODUCT
THEY TAP INTO LOCAL ENTREPRENEURIAL TALENT
AND THEY DO INCREDIBLE MARKETING
SO LET'S START WITH
A HALF MILLION VACCINATORS BUT LET ME MAKE THE STORY A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCRETE FOR YOU LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY OF SHRIRAM AN 18 MONTH BOY IN
A SOLUTION YOU BUILD A TOILET BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING AROUND THE WORLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS IF YOU BUILD A TOILET AND YOU LEAVE IT THERE IT DOESN'T GET USED
IS ALL OF THIS SO IMPORTANT
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER WHEN YOU TIE THE THREE THINGS TOGETHER
AND POLIO I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL EXAMPLES
WE'VE SEEN A 99 PERCENT REDUCTION IN POLIO IN 20 YEARS
SO IF YOU LOOK BACK TO 1988 THERE ARE ABOUT 350000 CASES OF POLIO ON THE PLANET THAT YEAR
IN 2009 WE'RE DOWN TO 1600 CASES
WELL HOW DID THAT HAPPEN
AND NGOS NEED TO TAP INTO THAT LOCAL ENTREPRENEURIAL TALENT AS WELL BECAUSE THE LOCALS KNOW HOW TO REACH THE VERY HARD TO SERVE
GET COKE TO THESE FAR FLUNG PLACES IF THEY CAN DO THAT WHY CAN'T GOVERNMENTS AND NGOS DO THE SAME THING AND I'M
WITH THE EYES OF CARPENTER AND SEE A CHAIR
AND I COULD LOOK AT THE TREE IN ITS WHOLE
AND ALL THE ABOVE WILL CEASE TO EXIST
AND WILL EXIST AT THE SAME TIME
NOW AROUND THREE YEARS BACK I
SIMPLIFIES AN OBJECT I FEEL THIS IS THE WAY OUR MIND MAKES SENSE OF THIS
AND SEE THE SHADE IT PROVIDES I COULD LOOK AT THE TREE WITH THE EYES OF THE PAINTER AND SEE THE BEAUTY IT HIDES
AND THE TIME AND THE PLACE WHERE I WAS WHEN I HEARD THIS CAME TOGETHER IN MY MIND TO CREATE A POEM WHICH ACTUALLY DOES NOT EXIST IN A SIMILAR WAY IN WHICH A
POINT OF VIEW BASICALLY THE WAY WE PERCEIVE REALITY NOW WHILE WAS PREPARING FOR TEDX I TRIED TO FIND THIS POEM AND SEE IF I
WITH HER PARENTS HER TWO BROTHERS AND HER GREAT AUNT THEY
A NEW HOUSE THIS TIME WITH RUNNING WATER ELECTRICITY A
IS WORTH ABOUT 40000 IN TODAY'S MONEY TODAY YOU CAN BUY A GIRL TRAFFICKED FOR A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH MEANS SHE'S ACTUALLY MORE DISPOSABLE
THAN ALL THE PEOPLE KILLED ON ALL THE BATTLEFIELDS IN THE 20TH CENTURY SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SONOGRAM GIRLS GET ABORTED BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN BORN
SEEING THINGS THAT NO HUMAN BEING SHOULD SEE THROUGHOUT HER TIME THERE
THEY MADE A DONATION TO AN ORGANIZATION BASED IN
ARKANSAS CALLED HEIFER INTERNATIONAL
HEIFER SENT TWO GOATS TO AFRICA
ONE OF THEM ENDED UP WITH BEATRICE'S PARENTS
AND THAT GOAT HAD TWINS THE TWINS STARTED PRODUCING MILK
THEY SOLD THE MILK FOR CASH THE CASH
THIS LATTER GROUP YOU'RE WRONG
THERE ARE TRUE ENOUGH IN EUROPE AND THE WEST WHEN WOMEN AND MEN HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO FOOD AND HEALTH CARE THERE ARE MORE WOMEN WE LIVE LONGER
BUT
IN MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN FACT DEMOGRAPHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE ARE ANYWHERE BETWEEN 60 MILLION AND 100 MILLION MISSING FEMALES IN THE CURRENT POPULATION
U S AID HELPING PEOPLE IS NOT EASY AND THERE HAVE BEEN BOOKS THAT HAVE CRITICIZED U S AID THERE'S BILL EASTERLY'S BOOK THERE'S A BOOK CALLED DEAD AID YOU KNOW THE CRITICISM IS FAIR IT ISN'T
PEOPLE SAY HOW HALF OF ALL WATER WELL PROJECTS A YEAR LATER ARE FAILED WHEN I WAS IN ZIMBABWE
WE WERE TOURING A PLACE WITH THE VILLAGE CHIEF HE WANTED TO RAISE MONEY FOR A SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THERE WAS SOME CONSTRUCTION A FEW YARDS AWAY AND I SAID WHAT'S THAT
HE SORT OF MUMBLED
TURNS OUT THAT IT'S A FAILED IRRIGATION PROJECT A
FEW YARDS AWAY WAS A FAILED
WAS MISERABLE SHE WAS BEATEN EVERY SINGLE DAY BY HER HUSBAND WHO WAS UNEMPLOYED HE WAS KIND OF A GAMBLER TYPE AND UNEMPLOYABLE THEREFORE AND TOOK HIS FRUSTRATIONS OUT ON
IMPROVE YOU LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES AND YOU CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE WE ALSO THINK THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THEY SHOULD BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS TOGETHER {NS}
ONE YEAR ALL THE CHICKENS DIED AND NO ONE WANTED TO PUT THE CHICKENS IN THERE IT'S TRUE BUT WE THINK THAT YOU DON'T THROUGH THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER YOU
AND PRETTY SOON THE PARENTS SAID YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY LET'S SEND BEATRICE TO SCHOOL SO AT NINE YEARS OF AGE BEATRICE STARTED IN FIRST GRADE AFTER ALL SHE'D NEVER BEEN TO A LICK OF SCHOOL WITH A SIX YEAR
HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL NOT TO A LICK ONE DAY HER PARENTS AGAIN SAID WHY SHOULD WE SPEND THE MONEY ON HER SHE'S GOING TO SPEND MOST OF HER LIFE LUGGING WATER BACK AND
TO VOCATIONAL SCHOOL FOR ACCOUNTING SHE SCOUTED FOR JOBS DOWN IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE IN THE SOUTH SHE FOUND A JOB SHE SCOUTED FOR
BROTHERS IN THE SAME FAMILY WERE TOTALLY FINE IN INDIA IN
THE INCOME THAT THEY TAKE IN THEY DON'T SPEND IT VERY WISELY AND UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THAT SPENDING IS DONE BY MEN SO RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO LIVE UNDER TWO DOLLARS A DAY ONE
PART OF THE WORLD IS A WONDERFUL EVENT IN NIGER ONE IN SEVEN WOMEN CAN EXPECT TO DIE DURING CHILDBIRTH AROUND THE WORLD ONE WOMAN DIES EVERY MINUTE AND A HALF FROM CHILDBIRTH
LITTLE SECRET OF POVERTY WHICH IS THAT NOT ONLY
TO FIVE GIRLS DIE AT A 50 PERCENT HIGHER MORTALITY RATE THAN BOYS IN ALL OF INDIA THE SECOND TENET OF HALF THE SKY
OF THOSE THINGS IS CONTRIBUTING TO A CAUSE LARGER THAN YOURSELF AND THE SECOND THING IT'S AN
RESOURCES IT'S A WASTE OF RESOURCES IF YOU DON'T USE SOMEONE LIKE DAI MANJU BILL GATES PUT IT VERY WELL WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING THROUGH SAUDI
BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET A ROAD BUILT TO LINK THEM UP TO THE REST OF CHINA AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY FIRST MAJOR OF TWO TENETS OF HALF THE SKY
LIKE HER YOU ME WE HAVE ALL WON THE LOTTERY OF LIFE AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO WE DISCHARGE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SO
TO THE BUSH TO HAVE THE BABY BUT YOU KNOW HER BODY WAS VERY IMMATURE
AND SHE ENDED UP HAVING OBSTRUCTED LABOR
THE BABY DIED AND SHE ENDED UP WITH A FISTULA
SO THAT MEANT SHE WAS INCONTINENT SHE COULDN'T CONTROL HER WASTES IN A WORD SHE STANK
THE VILLAGERS THOUGHT SHE WAS CURSED THEY
OPPORTUNITY IT CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT SAIMA
ONLY CHANGED HER OWN DYNAMIC SHE CHANGED HER HOUSEHOLD SHE CHANGED HER
LEAVE YOU WITH AND THAT IS THE STORY OF AN AID WORKER IN DARFUR
TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES ON SCHOLARSHIP TWO YEARS AGO SHE GRADUATED FROM CONNECTICUT COLLEGE
THERE WAS A MICROLENDING GROUP IN THE VILLAGE THAT GAVE HER A 65 DOLLAR LOAN SAIMA TOOK THAT MONEY AND SHE STARTED AN EMBROIDERY BUSINESS THE
AND WAS ON BREAK CHRISTMAS BREAK
SHE WAS IN HER GRANDMOTHER'S BACKYARD
AND SHE SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE HER BREAK DOWN IN TEARS
WHAT THAT WAS
WAS A BIRD FEEDER
AND SHE REALIZED
THAT SHE HAD THE GREAT FORTUNE
TO BE BORN IN A COUNTRY
WHERE WE TAKE SECURITY FOR GRANTED
WHERE WE NOT ONLY CAN FEED
WHEN SHE HAD HER SECOND DAUGHTER HER MOTHER IN LAW TOLD HER SON
AND THAT GOAT WAS 120 SO YOU SEE HOW TRANSFORMATIVE LITTLE BITS OF HELP CAN BE BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A REALITY
SO THEN I ASK WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING THAT WHY SHOULD YOU CARE
THE SECOND ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS MATERNAL MORTALITY YOU KNOW CHILDBIRTH
I'VE HINTED AT THEM EDUCATION AND ALSO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY SO OF COURSE WHEN YOU
LOOK YOU ALL ARE VERY WELL TRAVELED THIS IS TEDGLOBAL AFTER ALL BUT I DO HOPE TO TAKE YOU TO SOME PLACES YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO BEFORE
THAT IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE HIGHEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD IS IN GIRLS' EDUCATION LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BEATRICE BIIRA
DURING OBSTRUCTED LABOR THAT LEAVES A WOMAN INCONTINENT LET ME TELL YOU
NOT THE PROBLEM SHE'S MOVED OUT OF A VICIOUS CYCLE AND INTO A VIRTUOUS CYCLE I'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES LET ME TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS AND THERE ARE PREDICTABLE
THREE REASONS WHY THIS IS THE CASE
FOR ONE OVERPOPULATION IS ONE OF THE PERSISTENT CAUSES OF POVERTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU EDUCATE A BOY
HIS FAMILY TENDS TO HAVE FEWER KIDS BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY
WHEN YOU EDUCATE A GIRL
SHE TENDS TO HAVE
WHEN SHE COULDN'T PRODUCE ENOUGH SHE HIRED OTHER WOMEN IN THE VILLAGE PRETTY SOON SHE HAD 30 WOMEN IN THE VILLAGE WORKING FOR HER EMBROIDERY BUSINESS AND THEN WHEN SHE HAD TO
ALL OF THE EMBROIDERY GOODS FROM THE VILLAGE TO THE MARKETPLACE SHE NEEDED SOMEONE TO HELP HER DO THE TRANSPORT SO SHE HIRED HER HUSBAND SO NOW THEY'RE IN IT TOGETHER
I WILL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH TWO THINGS
ONE
IS THAT RESEARCH SHOWS
THAT ONCE YOU HAVE ALL OF YOUR MATERIAL NEEDS TAKEN CARE OF WHICH MOST OF US ALL OF US HERE IN THIS ROOM DO
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS IN LIFE THAT CAN ACTUALLY ELEVATE YOUR LEVEL OF
MORNING SHE KNEW IF SHE COULD GET TO NEARBY VILLAGE WHERE THERE WAS A FOREIGN MISSIONARY SHE WOULD BE SAVED BECAUSE SHE HAD SOME DAMAGE TO HER NERVES SHE CRAWLED ALL THE WAY 30 MILES TO THAT DOORSTEP HALF
MISSIONARY OPENED THE DOOR KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED TOOK HER TO A NEARBY FISTULA HOSPITAL IN ADDIS ABABA AND SHE WAS REPAIRED WITH A 350 DOLLAR OPERATION
TINY AMOUNTS {LG} BUT THEN WE GOT A MONEY TRANSFER FOR
CHALLENGES LOOK LIKE I WOULD SAY ON THE TOP OF THE AGENDA IS SEX TRAFFICKING AND I'LL JUST SAY TWO THINGS ABOUT THIS
SUGARY DRINKS AND PROSTITUTION AND FESTIVALS IF YOU JUST TAKE FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS AND PUT IT INTO THIS BASKET YOU WOULD HAVE A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT
SHE TENDS TO GET MARRIED LATER ON IN LIFE SHE TENDS TO HAVE KIDS LATER ON IN LIFE SHE TENDS TO HAVE FEWER KIDS AND THOSE KIDS THAT SHE DOES HAVE SHE EDUCATES THEM IN A MORE ENLIGHTENED FASHION
NO MATTER SHE WAS JUST DELIGHTED TO BE IN SCHOOL SHE ROCKETED TO THE TOP OF HER CLASS SHE STAYED AT THE TOP OF HER CLASS
THROUGH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
MIDDLE SCHOOL
AND THEN IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE SCORED BRILLIANTLY ON THE NATIONAL EXAMINATIONS
SO THAT SHE BECAME THE FIRST PERSON IN HER VILLAGE
TO DO WITH HER SO FINALLY THEY PUT HER AT THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE IN HUT THEY RIPPED OFF THE DOOR SO THAT THE HYENAS WOULD GET HER AT NIGHT THAT NIGHT THERE WAS A STICK IN THE HUT SHE FOUGHT OFF THE HYENAS WITH THAT STICK
AND SHE DOES THE PRODUCTION AND SOURCING AND NOW THEY HAVE A THIRD DAUGHTER AND THE DAUGHTERS ALL OF THEM ARE BEING TUTORED IN EDUCATION BECAUSE SAIMA KNOWS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THEY ARE RURAL AND THEY ARE FEMALE YOU KNOW FOR EVERY WOMAN WHO DOES DIE THERE ARE 20 WHO SURVIVE BUT END UP WITH AN INJURY AND THE MOST DEVASTATING INJURY IS OBSTETRIC FISTULA
WE HAVE HERE AS OUR GOAL IN SAUDI ARABIA TO BE ONE OF THE TOP 10 COUNTRIES WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY DO YOU THINK WE'LL MAKE IT SO BILL GATES AS HE
SOME OF YOU MAY BE THINKING GOSH THAT'S HYPERBOLE SHE'S EXAGGERATING WELL LET ME ASK YOU THIS
DAI MANJU WAS IN SIXTH GRADE WHEN HER PARENTS SAID WE'RE GOING TO PULL YOU OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THE 13 DOLLAR SCHOOL FEES ARE TOO MUCH FOR US YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN THE RICE PADDIES WHY WOULD WE WASTE THIS MONEY ON
THE DOCTORS AND NURSES THERE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS NOT ONLY SURVIVOR SHE WAS REALLY CLEVER AND THEY MADE HER A NURSE SO NOW MAHABUBA SHE IS SAVING THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF WOMEN SHE HAS
NEARLY 20 YEARS AS A TATTOO ANTHROPOLOGIST I'VE BEEN RECORDING SIMILAR TATTOO MEANINGS AMONGST THE WORLD'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WHO ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE
FOR INVENTING TATTOOING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THIS ALL BEGAN ON
REMOTE ST LAWRENCE ISLAND IN 1997 WHEN WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA AT FAIRBANKS AND I JOURNEYED THERE TO ST LAWRENCE ISLAND IN BERING STRAIT TO RECORD THE STORIES AND MEANINGS BEHIND THE LAST GENERATION OF TATTOO BEARERS WHO WERE EIGHT WOMEN ALL IN THEIR 80S AND
WAYS THAT ST LAWRENCE ISLANDERS ENGAGED WITH AND UNDERSTOOD THEIR SOCIAL PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL WORLDS BUT ALSO WHAT ULTIMATELY MADE THEM HUMAN
ARRIVED AROUND 1900 AND THEY BEGAN TO COMPEL MANY FAMILIES TO STOP THESE PRACTICES OF DISFIGUREMENT AND IN 1923 THE LAST GROUP OF WOMEN WERE TATTOOED
ON ST LAWRENCE ISLAND TATTOOING
WAS ULTIMATELY A VISUAL LANGUAGE OF COMMUNICATION THAT SPOKE
A SIMPLE FIRST GENERATION HD CAMERA THAT HAD ONE STARK BULB ON IT THAT CAST
HIS FACE AND ACTUALLY WE SHOT SOME FOOTAGE OF THIS MOMENT AND BECAUSE THE MAIN BODY OF THE FILM CREW WAS AT ANOTHER LOCATION
TO YOU IN THE AUDIENCE AND ALL THAT I REQUIRE IS A SIMPLE YES ANSWER FIRST QUESTION IS OR WAS DO ANY OF YOU
MEMBERS THERE ARE ALSO TATTOOS THAT MARKED IMPORTANT RITE OF PASSAGE CEREMONIES AND THERE WERE OTHER TATTOOS THAT CURED INFERTILITY PROBLEMS FOR WOMEN AND THERE WERE STILL MORE DESIGNS THAT WERE BELIEVED TO REPEL THE ADVANCES OF MALEVOLENT SPIRITS THAT WERE THOUGHT TO BE THE HARBINGERS OF
ULTIMATELY IT'S A VERY SLOW AND TEDIOUS TECHNIQUE AND IT ACTUALLY TOOK MANY MANY SITTINGS WITH A FEMALE TATTOO ARTIST IN FACT MANY YEARS BEFORE WOMAN
I'M GOING TO USE THEM TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FAVORITE SUBJECT DECEPTION
I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT'S AN APPLICATION THAT I THINK WILL BE USEFUL
INTO BACON RIGHT BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE I LEARNED A LOT MORE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAT MY FOOD CHOICES HAD ON THE WORLD AROUND ME
MEAT CONSUMPTION IS ABOUT 60 KILOS PER PERSON PER YEAR RIGHT NOW AND TWO THRIDS OF THAT IS
LET'S EAT BETTER AND LET'S MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE ALRIGHT THANK
LEAKED INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO CREATING WHAT'S CALLED EUTROPHICATION AND
TO FEED ITS INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR MEAT AS I ALREADY MENTIONED
DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE RAIN FORESTS ARE SPONGE
IS WHEN RAIN FORESTS AND OTHER FORESTS ARE CLEARED IN ORDER TO
HEALTH REASONS AND PARTLY BECAUSE I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO CARE MORE ABOUT THE ANIMALS THAT GET KILLED AND
WHAT MADE US INTELLIGENT COOPERATIVE HUNTING IS WHAT HELPED US DEVELOP LANGUAGE OUR SOCIAL SKILLS
AND CORN SOYBEANS ARE GROWN FOR THE
INTO A BIG JUICY STEAK RIGHT AND I THINK THERE'S NOTHING MORE HUMAN MEAT HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO OUR IDENTITY AS HUMAN BEINGS AND CENTRAL TO
COULD I KEEP CREATIVE CONTROL OVER THAT LIGHTING ON A SUBJECT THAT SIZE SO
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS SO ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEBASTIAN I AM VERY VERY GRATEFUL
BUT I STILL NEEDED THE EYES OF A CHILD TO FIND MY EXTRAORDINARY SUBJECT
BROUGHT IN A GROUND BEETLE FROM THE GARDEN THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULARLY SPECIAL ABOUT THIS INSECT
AND WHEN I GOT IT HOME I STOOD IN MY KITCHEN AND STARED AT IT FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES I COULDN'T BELIEVE I WAS IN POSSESSION OF THIS BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
TO REMOVE ALL THOSE STICKY HANDPRINTS BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS TOUCH THOSE BIG BUGS
I HAD BEEN PHOTOGRAPHER FOR 18 YEARS BEFORE I BEGAN THE MICROSCULPTURE
FORTUNATELY FOR ME THOUGH I'VE GOT TWO GREAT KIDS WHO ARE STILL CURIOUS ABOUT THE
KIND OF SHOWED ME THAT MY IMAGES HAD WORTH YOU KNOW THEY WEREN'T DISPOSABLE
THINK THERE IS A DANGER AS WE GET OLDER THAT OUR CURIOSITY BECOMES SLIGHTLY MUTED OR DULLED BY FAMILIARITY
IMAGINE AND NOW YOU REALIZE YOU WANT TO BUY MY PRODUCT {LG} DO WE HAVE ANY STRATEGY AMP GUYS PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND YEAH SERIOUSLY LIKE
SHOWED ME THAT HYPNOSIS IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST
PERSONAL COMPUTER
THAT ANALYZES AND RATIONALIZES EVERYTHING WE DO OR THINK ABOUT IT'S ALSO AN EXCUSE GENERATOR
WE SMOKE
BECAUSE WE LIKE IT
BUT DID YOU LIKE YOUR FIRST CIGARETTE
WE EAT AT NIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE SUPER HUNGRY
BUT
IS THAT COOKIE A PERFECT THING TO EAT AT MIDNIGHT
AT ALL IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE A 30 KILO KETTLEBELL IS NOTHING FOR YOU {LG} BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY WAS HYPNOSIS
AND HE DECIDED TO BE LESS CONVENTIONAL INSTEAD OF PUTTING HER INTO FULL ANESTHESIA {NS} HE HYPNOTIZED HER
IMAGINING WHAT COULD YOU OVERCOME WITH HYPNOSIS I WANT YOU TO THINK WHAT CHALLENGES
THE SECOND THING WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IS TO BYPASS A CRITICAL FACTOR OF OUR MIND
AND BY THE WAY HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE SMOKE CIGARETTES PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER TRIED TO QUIT SMOKING BUT YOU STILL SMOKE PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND
HE HYPNOTIZED HER AND HE TOLD HER TO IMAGINE SHE'S MOVING TO A DISTANT DISTANT LOCATION WHERE SHE CAN CALM DOWN RELAX HERSELF WHERE SHE CAN SING
A STORY OF A GUINEAN SINGER ALAMA KANTE WHO HAD A THROAT TUMOR AND SHE HAD TO HAVE IT REMOVED
AND HER SURGEON KNEW THAT ONE SMALL MISTAKE
ONE MILLIMETER RIGHT OR LEFT
AND HE WOULD END HER CAREER
HAVE TO KNOW THAT I'M A VERY SKEPTICAL PERSON AND THAT FIVE YEAR CAREER AS A PROFESSIONAL
SOMETIMES IT WOULD TAKE JUST A COUPLE SECONDS LIKE WE DID A MINUTE AGO TO START A VERY LIGHT STATE OF HYPNOSIS SOMETIMES IT TAKES A COUPLE HOURS OR A COUPLE OF SESSIONS BUT EVERY SINGLE HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL CAN BE HYPNOTIZED
{LG} DR WELL THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT SKILL TO HAVE SO WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM AGAIN HOW TO DO THAT AND WE HAVE A PROOF OF THAT
OF OUR BRAIN WHERE ALL THE EMOTIONS AND HABITS ARE CODED WITHOUT THOSE EXCUSES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY SMOKE BECAUSE AS A CHILD YOU SAW SOMEONE SMOKING SURROUNDED BY MANY FRIENDS AND YOU ASSOCIATED SMOKING WITH A SOCIAL STATUS
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
MARIE AND DANIELLA THEY BOTH ARE MASTERS IN MANAGEMENT STUDENTS AT LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL AND WHEN THEY WERE
THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS OLD THEY ACQUIRED A VERY IMPORTANT SKILL
COUNTING FROM ONE
TO TEN
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AND OF COURSE RIGHT NOW SOME OF YOU MAY THINK OH COME ON DANIEL I'M A WELL EDUCATED PERSON I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'D HYPNOTIZE ME
MY FINGERS YOU WILL FORGET YOUR NAME YOU WOULD PROBABLY THINK FIRST OF
AFRAID OF HYPNOSIS OR WHO JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN IT AND THAT IS WHY WE ASKED YOU TODAY
HOWEVER HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE ALL TRIED TO CHANGE SOMETHING IN OUR LIVES FOR EXAMPLE QUIT SMOKING STOP PROCRASTINATING ETC ETC ETC ALL THOSE SUGGESTIONS ARE NOT COHERENT WITH OUR SUBCONSCIOUSNESS AND THEY GO
TO THE POWER OF WILL
WHICH IS NOT THAT POWERFUL SO WHEN WE WANT TO STOP PROCRASTINATING WE USUALLY DO THAT TOMORROW AND TOMORROW NEVER COMES
WE CAN USE HYPNOSIS TO HELP
AND THAT LEAVES ME WONDERING IF A COCAINE ADDICT CAN KICK HER ADDICTION OUT FROM HER LIFE
WITH THE POWER OF OUR NOT SO POWERFUL WILL ANOTHER QUESTION ANYONE HERE DOING COCAINE
ANOTHER STUDY IT WAS PROVED THAT HYPNOSIS IS
A PROFESSIONAL SINGER CAN SING DURING SURGERY WITH HER THROAT CUT OPEN WHY AREN'T WE USING HYPNOSIS TO OVERCOME SMALL AND BIGGER CHALLENGES IN OUR LIVES
BUT WOULD YOU WATCH THAT VIDEO WHEN YOU'RE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AT A PARTY
IN 2007 PROFESSOR MONTGOMERY PUBLISHED CLINICAL STUDY ON 220 BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND HE PROVED
WELL THAT WOULD BE TIME TRAVELING BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER BE LATE AGAIN BUT IF I COULD CHOOSE TWO SUPERPOWERS WELL THAT WOULD BE MIND CONTROL MY LIFE WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER ESPECIALLY THAT I'M IN
JUST IMAGINATION JUST THE POWER OF OUR MIND
MAY THINK IT A GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO FORGET YOUR NAME WHEN I SNAP MY FINGERS
CAN CHANGE THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR BODY FOCUS THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR PERCEPTION FOR EXAMPLE SMOKING FOCUS THAT CAN IMPROVE YOUR LIFE
SO WANT YOU TO MEET SARAH
SARAH IS A
CO CHAIR AT TEDXLONDONBUSINESSSCHOOL SHE'S AN MBA 2016 AT LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL AND SHE'S A VERY SMART YOUNG PROFESSIONAL
HOWEVER SHE'S NOT AN ATHLETE LET'S
TAKE A
BUT LET ME REPHRASE THAT QUESTION DO WE HAVE ANY INVESTMENT BANKERS HERE {LG} I
MY BOSS DOESN'T SEE THAT WELL IN ANOTHER STUDY PUBLISHED IN 1993 A STUDY ON A COCAINE ADDICT WHO WAS
ALTHOUGH
YOU HEAR EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON
YOU HAVE A FULL CONTROL
AND
YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES AT ANY POINT YOU WANT
YOUR BRAIN EMITS THE SAME BRAINWAVES AS IF YOU WERE SLEEPING
BUT IF I WANTED YOU TO REMEMBER ONE THING ABOUT HYPNOSIS IT WOULDN'T BE THETA BRAINWAVES IT WOULDN'T BE CRITICAL
WORKSHOPS PRACTICE PRACTICE
AND FINALLY PERFORMING
AND BEFORE MY RETIREMENT AT THE AGE OF 22
HAVING HYPNOTIZED OVER 1000 PEOPLE I ACTUALLY REALIZED THAT IT WORKS
SAME EMPTINESS THAT WE ALL KNOW WHEN YOU FORGET SOMETHING EXTREMELY OBVIOUS
DR AND MARIE WELL SHE'S NOT A MATHEMATICIAN {LG} AND USUALLY NOW I WOULD GET OKAY DANIEL BUT IF IT'S NOT BLACK MAGIC HOW DOES IT WORK
JUST IMAGINING THAT YOU ARE MOVING TO A DISTANT DISTANT LOCATION IN WHICH YOU CAN CALM DOWN RELAX FEEL COMFORTABLE
THANKS TO THE VOCAL CORDS MOVEMENTS HER SURGEON KNEW WHERE TO PUT HIS SCALPEL AND WHERE NOT TO THE SURGERY WAS SUCCESSFUL IT WAS COVERED BY MAJOR NEWS SUCH AS BBC THE TIMES LE FIGARO
INTERESTING THING ABOUT HYPNOSIS IS THAT WHEN YOU CONNECT YOUR BRAIN TO AN EEG YOU WILL
DECIDED TO QUIT COCAINE SHE HAD THREE SESSIONS OF HYPNOSIS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND HYPNOSIS WAS THE ONLY TREATMENT METHOD THAT SHE HAD AND IN 1993 WHEN THE STUDY WAS PUBLISHED THEY
AND A CRITICAL FACTOR IS WE CAN SAY A
IN HYPNOSIS YOU WOULD FOCUS ONLY ON ONE
ASPECT OF SUGGESTION ONE SELECTED ASPECT OF A SUGGESTION
AND SECONDLY
WE HAVE ALL FORGOTTEN SOME OBVIOUS THINGS IN LIFE FOR EXAMPLE THIS FORMULA AT MATH EXAM OR A DATE ON HISTORY EXAM OR SOME ANNIVERSARY
WHO WROTE THERAPY CAN LEAVE NOW
BUT DEVIL THE DEVIL IS QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE AT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SHOW THAT I ORGANIZED AND I ORGANIZED FEW OF THEM I ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON
WHO WANTED TO INTERRUPT ME BECAUSE HE OR SHE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE DOING DEVIL'S
SO YOU IMAGINE MY EXCITEMENT WHICH I FELT WHEN I HEARD THAT HYPNOSIS ACTUALLY WORKS
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER THAT HYPNOSIS IS A VERY STRONG FEELING OF INNER FOCUS
IT BECAME VERY PRESENT THAT WE WEREN'T UNLOCKING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF OUR
SOME TEAMS HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE AT THE END OF THE DAY SOME TEAMS WORK ON
A CREATIVE TEAM LIKE YOURS TJ BUT I'M IN A CORPORATION ORGANIZATION BIG NON PROFIT BIG BUREAUCRACY WHAT CAN WE
STORIES THAT HAPPEN YOU MIGHT BE THINKING AND I'LL
ITSELF SO ON LAB DAY ALL THAT IDEATION THAT HAPPENED EACH THURSDAY ON DRAWING BOARDS
THEY WERE FACING A PROBLEM
THEY NEEDED TO CUT PRODUCTION COSTS BY 10 BECAUSE OF LOWER DVD SALES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER
COSTS RISING IN THE PRODUCTION SCENE
BUT THEY WANTED TO KEEP THE PIXAR QUALITY THAT WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE VERY HIGH
SO RATHER THAN KIND OF MEET IN THE BOARDROOM AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CUT THE COSTS AND THEN
HAD PRETTY MUCH A SERIES OF DRAWING BOARDS TO PLAN IT OUT ORGANIZATION GOES INTO IT AND THE IDEAS AS ED CATMULL WRITES IN HIS BOOK CREATIVITY INC
ONE OF THE COOLEST STORIES TO COME OUT OF OUR PROGRAM IS A LITTLE IPAD APP THAT OCCURRED CALLED MY STORY MY STORY BEGAN AS BRIAN VANASKI ONE OF OUR
SCHOOL WE TAKE ALL THE PROJECTS DONE AND WITHIN AN
WITH THOSE AROUND US IT CAN MULTIPLY I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
I THINK IF ALBUQUERQUE AND ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS WE ALL SERVE AND SPEND OUR LIVES WITH EVERY DAY EMBRACE A
WE LEAVE THE DUST OF THE DAY BEHIND SET ASIDE PROJECT WORK CLEAR SOME TIME JUST TO TALK ABOUT IDEAS UNDER OUR BROAD UMBRELLA OF USING
INTELLIGENT AND INNOVATIVE THINKER BUT SHE'S FRUSTRATED SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND COULDN'T GET THE STORY TOGETHER AND ORGANIZED THE LIGHT BULB CAME ON AND THAT BECAME
ANY ORGANIZATION CAN TAKE TO TURN INNOVATION FROM A
AFTER ALL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HARDEST FOR ALL OF US TO DO IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING AND
THE REMARKABLE THING WAS THAT 18 MONTH OLD BABIES JUST BARELY WALKING AND TALKING WOULD GIVE HER THE CRACKERS IF SHE LIKED THE CRACKERS BUT THEY WOULD GIVE HER THE BROCCOLI IF SHE LIKED THE BROCCOLI
ON THE OTHER HAND 15 MONTH OLDS WOULD STARE AT HER FOR A LONG TIME
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES WHO ARE FLITTING AROUND THE GARDEN AND EXPLORING AND WE'RE THE CATERPILLARS WHO ARE INCHING ALONG OUR NARROW GROWNUP ADULT
JUST US PRIMATES BUT ALSO INCLUDING OTHER MAMMALS BIRDS EVEN MARSUPIALS LIKE KANGAROOS AND WOMBATS
YOU ACTUALLY LOOK IN THEIR BRAINS YOU SEE THAT THEY'RE FLOODED WITH THESE NEUROTRANSMITTERS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD AT INDUCING LEARNING AND PLASTICITY AND THE INHIBITORY PARTS HAVEN'T COME ON YET
OUT THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ANSWER IF WE LOOK ACROSS MANY MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF
ONE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT IS THAT BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN ARE LIKE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OF THE {NS} SO THEY'RE THE PROTECTED BLUE SKY GUYS WHO JUST HAVE TO GO OUT AND LEARN AND HAVE GOOD IDEAS AND WE'RE PRODUCTION AND
DO EXPERIMENTS WE CALL IT GETTING INTO EVERYTHING OR ELSE PLAYING AND THERE'S BEEN A BUNCH OF INTERESTING STUDIES RECENTLY THAT HAVE SHOWN THIS PLAYING AROUND IS REALLY A KIND OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM
WELL IF WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT WAY OF GETTING TASTE OF THAT KIND OF BABY CONSCIOUSNESS AS ADULTS I THINK THE BEST THING IS THINK ABOUT CASES WHERE WE'RE PUT IN A NEW SITUATION THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN
AND YOUNG CHILDREN ARE VERY BAD AT NARROWING DOWN TO JUST ONE THING BUT THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT TAKING IN LOTS OF INFORMATION FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT SOURCES AT ONCE
CRACKERS I TASTED THE CRACKERS EWW YUCK SO SHE'D ACT AS IF WHAT SHE WANTED WAS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE BABIES
OUT THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOW LONG A CHILDHOOD A SPECIES HAS AND HOW BIG THEIR BRAINS ARE COMPARED TO THEIR BODIES AND HOW SMART AND FLEXIBLE THEY ARE AND SORT OF THE
OTHER CREATURES LIKE THE CROWS AREN'T VERY GOOD AT DOING ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR BUT THEY'RE EXTREMELY GOOD AT LEARNING ABOUT LAWS OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND OF COURSE WE HUMAN BEINGS ARE WAY OUT ON THE END OF THE DISTRIBUTION LIKE THE
THERE'S BEEN A REVOLUTION IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MACHINE LEARNING RECENTLY AND IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE
TO BE BEAUTIFULLY SUITED TO DOING JUST ONE THING VERY WELL SO THEY SEEM TO BE BEAUTIFULLY SUITED TO PECKING GRAIN IN ONE ENVIRONMENT
BASICALLY AS DUMB AS DUMPS SO THEY'RE VERY VERY GOOD AT PECKING FOR GRAIN AND THEY'RE NOT MUCH GOOD AT DOING ANYTHING ELSE
OUR BABIES AND CHILDREN ARE DEPENDENT ON US FOR MUCH LONGER THAN THE BABIES OF ANY OTHER SPECIES MY SON IS 23
DO CHILDREN LEARN SO MUCH AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO LEARN SO MUCH IN SUCH
THAT NEW HYPOTHESIS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND WHAT BAYES SHOWED WAS A MATHEMATICAL WAY THAT YOU COULD DO THAT
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE CHILDREN ARE USING STATISTICS TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE WORLD
LITTLE 18 MONTH OLD BABIES HAVE ALREADY DISCOVERED THIS REALLY PROFOUND FACT ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS WANT THE SAME THING AND WHAT'S MORE THEY FELT THAT THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY DO THINGS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE GET WHAT THEY WANTED
THINK LIKE ADULTS DO BUT IF WHAT WE WANT IS TO BE LIKE THOSE BUTTERFLIES TO HAVE OPEN MINDEDNESS OPEN LEARNING IMAGINATION CREATIVITY
LIKE TO BE ONE OF THESE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES WHO CAN TEST FIVE HYPOTHESES IN TWO
A PARTICULARLY ADORABLE AND ARTICULATE LITTLE BOY BUT WHAT CRISTINE DISCOVERED IS THIS IS ACTUALLY QUITE
ARE FOR LEARNING THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOR WE MIGHT EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE REALLY POWERFUL LEARNING MECHANISMS
COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS THAT WILL GIVE THEM A CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY MEASURE
HE COULDN'T TAKE THE PERSPECTIVE OF ANOTHER PERSON OR UNDERSTAND CAUSE AND
ELSE SORT OF GOES DARK
AND WE EVEN KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THE BRAIN DOES THIS SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PAY ATTENTION IS THAT THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX THE SORT OF EXECUTIVE PART OF OUR BRAINS SENDS A SIGNAL THAT MAKES A LITTLE PART OF OUR BRAIN MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE MORE PLASTIC BETTER AT LEARNING AND SHUTS DOWN ACTIVITY IN ALL THE REST OF OUR
SCIENTISTS DO IS THEY HAVE A HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY THINK MIGHT BE LIKELY TO START WITH THEY GO OUT AND TEST IT AGAINST THE EVIDENCE THE EVIDENCE MAKES THEM CHANGE THAT HYPOTHESIS
FOUR YEAR OLDS THEY'RE JUST LEARNING HOW TO COUNT BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY THEY'RE
AS LONG AS TWO YEARS WHICH IS A REALLY LONG TIME IN THE LIFE OF A BIRD WHEREAS THE CHICKENS ARE ACTUALLY MATURE WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
SO CHILDHOOD IS THE REASON WHY THE CROWS END UP ON THE COVER OF SCIENCE AND THE CHICKENS END UP IN THE SOUP POT
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LONG CHILDHOOD THAT SEEMS TO BE CONNECTED TO KNOWLEDGE AND
WELL IF YOU GO BACK TO THOSE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS A LOT OF THEM HAVE SAID THAT BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN WERE BARELY CONSCIOUS IF THEY WERE CONSCIOUS AT ALL
WE ARE AS ADULTS NOW HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW ADULT CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS AND ADULTS' ATTENTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS LOOK KIND OF LIKE A
THINK THOSE BABIES ARE ACTUALLY MAKING COMPLICATED CALCULATIONS WITH CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES THAT THEY'RE REVISING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS
BECAUSE AFTER ALL IF YOU ASK EVEN GROWNUPS ABOUT STATISTICS THEY LOOK EXTREMELY STUPID HOW COULD IT BE THAT CHILDREN DOING STATISTICS
BUT THEN WHAT BETTY DID WAS TO TAKE A LITTLE TASTE OF FOOD FROM EACH BOWL AND SHE WOULD ACT AS IF SHE
THIS EARLY PERIOD WHEN WE'RE COMPLETELY PROTECTED WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LEARN
HAVE BIGGER BRAINS RELATIVE TO OUR BODIES BY FAR THAN ANY OTHER
AND THE OTHER INTERESTING THING IS THAT THEY'RE USING THAT EVIDENCE TO GET TO AN IDEA GET TO A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE WORLD THAT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY TO BEGIN WITH
AND IN STUDIES WE'VE JUST BEEN DOING IN MY LAB SIMILAR STUDIES WE'VE SHOW THAT FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER AT FINDING OUT AN UNLIKELY HYPOTHESIS THAN ADULTS ARE WHEN WE GIVE THEM EXACTLY THE SAME TASK
SO THAT THOSE THREE DAYS IN PARIS SEEM TO BE MORE FULL OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND EXPERIENCE THAN ALL THE MONTHS OF BEING A WALKING
MATHEMATICS IS AT THE CORE OF THE BEST MACHINE LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE NOW
OF THAT THING THAT WE'RE ATTENDING TO BECOMES EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND VIVID
ESSENTIALLY WHAT BAYES DID WAS TO PROVIDE MATHEMATICAL
BUT IT HAS ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE AND THAT ONE BIG DISADVANTAGE IS THAT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY DO ALL THAT LEARNING YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELPLESS SO
SEEM PRETTY USELESS AND ACTUALLY IN MANY WAYS THEY'RE WORSE THAN USELESS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PUT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY INTO JUST KEEPING THEM
WANTED TO KNOW IF BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN COULD UNDERSTAND THIS REALLY PROFOUND THING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW COULD WE ASK THEM
SO WE DID JUST THIS WE GAVE FOUR YEAR OLDS THIS PATTERN OF EVIDENCE AND WE JUST ASKED THEM TO MAKE IT
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE TO BE A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER
MAKE UP ROOM I SAW TWO ROWS OF MODELS FACE TO THE MIRROR BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A LINE OF BONES I THOUGHT IT'S THE LIGHT BUT IT WASN'T ON THE
BUT I WAS LUCKY I'VE MET DR RACHEL ADATO SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE ISRAELI PARLIAMENT AND SHE SAID JUST ONE THING ADI IF WE CAN PROVE THAT
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE LIFE BUT FIRST WE DESERVE TO FEEL GOOD
HOW CAN WE DO IT VERY SIMPLE NOW JUST ONE THING WHY IS THE FASHION INDUSTRY WHY ARE THE FASHION COMPANIES ARE NOT MAKING ALL SIZE RANGES IN THEIR STORES
YOU KNOW WHY IT'S NOT SEXY ENOUGH
THEY
ONE OF THEM I USED TO SAY YOU'RE PRETTY BUT YOU HAVE TO LOSE WEIGHT BUT I DIDN'T IMAGINE THAT TO SAY TO SOMEONE TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS IS TO SEND HER TO DIE WITH THIS MESSAGE I WENT TO THE NATIONAL TV IT WAS FRIDAY NIGHT
GIRLS BEAUTIFUL JASMINE ONE OF THE MODELS
ASKED ME FOR JUST A PIECE OF MY SANDWICH SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SHE STARTS EATING AND THEN THE AGENT CALLS HER
AND START SCREAMING HOW DARE YOU EAT YOU HAVE A BIG AUDITION ON THURSDAY
SHE STARTED CRYING
I WAS THERE I WAS ONE OF THEM THAT'S WHY I CAN TELL YOU WHY YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU SEE I WAS A LUCKY BOY SINCE I WAS MY
SHOT CATALOGUES
COVERS
BEAUTY QUEENS
I STARTED SHOOTING FOR THE BIGGEST MODELING AGENCIES IN THE WORLD
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE 90'S I WAS SHOOTING IN PARIS WHEN CALVIN KLEIN DECIDED TO PRESENT HIS NEW FACE
KATE MOSS
I WAS THERE
SHE WAS REALLY REALLY AMAZING
BUT SHE WAS TOO SKINNY
BONES WERE SHOWING
MR KLEIN SAID THAT SHE RAISED HIS INCOME BY 450
WHEN SOMEONE LIKE CALVIN KLEIN SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
EVERYBODY'S LISTENING
ALL THE WAY
OF US TO COME IN ONE SIZE IT'S NOT NORMAL FROM NOW ON
17 GIRLS WOMEN AND 3 BOYS
ALL OF THEM SAID JUST ONE THING
WE WANT TO BE PRETTY
WHAT IS PRETTY FOR YOU I ASKED
AND THEY LOOKED
AT THE POSTER ON THE SUDIO WALL AND THEY SAID THAT'S WHAT I MEAN GOOD LOOKING ADI
YOU WANNA BE LIKE THE POSTER
THE
FAMOUS VERY FAST AND WHEN I WAS 26 I ALREADY
HIDING BUT MY MOTHER WAS AT MY SIDE THE MIDWIFE SAID SHE COULD SEE THE BABY'S HEAD BUT ALL I COULD FEEL WAS A RING OF FIRE
ON THE FRONTLINES OF FIGHTING HATE IN AMERICA HAS BEEN STUDY IN WHAT I'VE COME TO CALL REVOLUTIONARY LOVE REVOLUTIONARY LOVE
TO GO OUT AND SHOOT SOME TOWEL HEADS WE SHOULD KILL THEIR CHILDREN TOO AND EVERY EMOTIONAL IMPULSE IN ME
RETURN TO THE FIRE AND I WILL LEAD YOU SHE MOUNTED A HORSE SHE DONNED A TURBAN
WONDER ABOUT THEM THEN I WILL LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES EVEN WHEN IT'S HARD I WILL REFUSE TO HATE THEM EVEN WHEN THEY HATE ME I WILL EVEN VOW TO PROTECT THEM WHEN THEY ARE IN HARM'S WAY THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SIKH S I K H
AND SAID NOTHING HAS CHANGED
AND I ASKED
WHO HAVE WE NOT YET TRIED TO LOVE
WE DECIDED TO CALL THE MURDERER IN
BROTHER SISTER AUNT UNCLE AND WHEN WE SAY THIS WHAT WE ARE SAYING
YOU WILL TEND TO THE WOUND IN THE ONES WHO WANT TO HURT HIM
YOU WILL TEACH HIM HOW TO LOVE HIMSELF
BECAUSE YOU LOVE YOURSELF
YOU WILL WHISPER IN HIS EAR
AS I WHISPER IN YOURS
YOU ARE BRAVE
YOU ARE BRAVE
THANK YOU
POLICIES BY THE STATE AND ACTS OF HATE IN THE STREET AND IN OUR MOST PAINFUL MOMENTS IN THE FACE OF THE FIRES OF INJUSTICE I HAVE SEEN LABORS OF LOVE DELIVER US
DON'T ABANDON YOUR POSTS MY DEAR MY GRANDFATHER SAW ME AS A WARRIOR I WAS A LITTLE GIRL IN TWO LONG BRAIDS BUT I PROMISED
BECAME MY SWORD MY LAW DEGREE BECAME MY SHIELD
FAILS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY I BECOME ANGRY TO PROTECT RANA BUT RANA IS STILL WONDERING ABOUT FRANK LISTENING
AMERICANS CAME TO MY HUSBAND'S MEMORIAL THEY DID NOT KNOW ME BUT THEY WEPT WITH ME TELL THEM THANK YOU
MAN WITH A TURBAN AND BEARD AND I REALIZE THAT OUR NATION'S NEW ENEMY
LOOKS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER
AND THESE TURBANS MEANT TO REPRESENT OUR COMMITMENT TO SERVE
CAST US AS TERRORISTS AND SIKHS BECAME TARGETS OF
WE WERE MAKING THE NATION SAFER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
AND THEN MY SON WAS BORN
IN A TIME
WHEN HATE CRIMES AGAINST OUR COMMUNITIES ARE AT THE HIGHEST THEY HAVE BEEN SINCE 9 11
WHEN RIGHT WING NATIONALIST MOVEMENTS ARE ON THE RISE AROUND THE GLOBE AND HAVE CAPTURED THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES
{LG} SO LET ME SHOW YOU HOW I CAME TO SEE LOVE AS A FORCE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE THROUGH THREE LESSONS
LEARN THAT PARTICIPATION IN OPPRESSION COMES AT A COST
IT CUTS THEM OFF FROM THEIR OWN CAPACITY TO LOVE
THIS
WAS MY SECOND LESSON IN REVOLUTIONARY LOVE
WE LOVE OUR OPPONENTS
WHEN WE TEND THE WOUND
IN THEM
TENDING TO THE WOUND
IS NOT HEALING THEM ONLY THEY CAN DO
TRAIN OUR EYES TO LOOK UPON STRANGERS ON THE STREET ON THE SUBWAY ON THE SCREEN AND SAY IN OUR
THAT REVOLUTIONARY LOVE IS THE CALL OF OUR TIMES NOW IF YOU CRINGE WHEN PEOPLE SAY LOVE IS THE ANSWER I DO TOO {LG}
WHEN EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND NEWS OF VIOLENCE HITS OUR BODIES HARD SOMETIMES LESS THAN A MINUTE APART IT FEELS LIKE
THROUGH YOUR BODY THEN YOUR MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT IS TO WONDER LISTEN AND RESPOND TO YOUR OWN
IT BECOMES AN ACT OF WILL
TO WONDER
WHY
I ASK
WHY DID YOU AGREE TO SPEAK WITH US
FRANK SAYS
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED BUT
I'M ALSO SORRY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE KILLED ON 9
WE LOVE OURSELVES WHEN WE
BREATHE THROUGH THE FIRE OF PAIN
AND REFUSE TO LET IT HARDEN INTO HATE
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE
THAT LOVE MUST BE PRACTICED IN ALL THREE DIRECTIONS TO BE REVOLUTIONARY
LOVING JUST OURSELVES
FEELS GOOD BUT
IT'S NARCISSISM
WAHEGURU JI KI FATEH
THERE IS A MOMENT
ON THE BIRTHING TABLE
THAT FEELS LIKE DYING
THE BODY IN LABOR STRETCHES TO FORM AN IMPOSSIBLE CIRCLE THE CONTRACTIONS ARE LESS THAN A MINUTE APART
WAVE AFTER WAVE THERE IS BARELY TIME TO BREATHE
WE DON'T PUSH WE WILL DIE IF WE DON'T BREATHE WE WILL DIE REVOLUTIONARY LOVE REQUIRES US TO BREATHE AND PUSH THROUGH THE FIRE WITH A WARRIOR'S HEART AND SAINT'S EYES SO THAT ONE DAY
ONE DAY YOU WILL SEE MY SON
AS YOUR OWN
AND PROTECT HIM WHEN I AM NOT THERE
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITH THEIR INSECURITY BUT TO HURT US TO PULL THE TRIGGER OR CAST THE VOTE OR PASS THE POLICY AIMED AT US BUT IF SOME OF US BEGIN TO WONDER ABOUT THEM LISTEN EVEN TO THEIR STORIES
THEIR GRIEF IN THE NAME OF LOVE AND FORGIVENESS BUT WHEN WE SUPPRESS OUR RAGE THAT'S WHEN IT HARDENS INTO HATE DIRECTED OUTWARD BUT USUALLY
DIRECTED INWARD
BUT MOTHERING
HAS TAUGHT ME THAT ALL OF OUR EMOTIONS ARE
TO
HIS WIDOW JOGINDER KAUR
I WEPT WITH HER AND I ASKED HER
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
I WAS EXPECTING BLAME
BUT SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID
TELL THEM THANK YOU
IN THOSE MOMENTS MY SON PLACES HIS HAND ON MY CHEEK AND SAYS DANCE TIME MOMMY AND WE DANCE
WHAT IF THIS DARKNESS IS NOT THE DARKNESS OF THE TOMB BUT THE DARKNESS OF THE WOMB
CHANGED FEDERAL HATE CRIMES POLICY THE CHOICE TO LOVE OUR OPPONENTS IS MORAL AND PRAGMATIC AND IT OPENS UP THE PREVIOUSLY UNIMAGINABLE POSSIBILITY OF RECONCILIATION
BUT REMEMBER
IT TOOK 15 YEARS TO MAKE THAT PHONE CALL
I HAD TO TEND TO MY OWN
RAGE
AND GRIEF FIRST
LOVING OUR OPPONENTS REQUIRES US
TO LOVE OURSELVES
IS MORE THAN A RUSH OF FEELING THAT HAPPENS TO US IF WE'RE LUCKY LOVE IS SWEET LABOR FIERCE BLOODY IMPERFECT LIFE GIVING
BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA
ARE STILL SEEN AS CRIMINAL
BROWN PEOPLE ILLEGAL
QUEER AND TRANS PEOPLE IMMORAL
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE SAVAGE
WOMEN AND GIRLS AS PROPERTY AND WHEN THEY FAIL TO SEE OUR BODIES AS SOME MOTHER'S CHILD IT BECOMES EASIER
TO BAN US
DETAIN US DEPORT US IMPRISON US
PARTNER BECAME MY HUSBAND
I DIDN'T EXPECT
THAT AND
WE BECAME PART OF
A GENERATION OF ADVOCATES
WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES FACING THEIR OWN FIRES
I WORKED INSIDE OF SUPERMAX
OTHERS IS INEFFECTIVE THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF OUR MOVEMENTS LIVE RIGHT NOW
JUST TENDING TO IT
ALLOWS US TO SEE OUR OPPONENTS
THE TERRORIST THE FANATIC
THE DEMAGOGUE
THEY'VE BEEN RADICALIZED BY CULTURES AND POLICIES THAT WE TOGETHER CAN CHANGE
THIS IS OUR GREAT TRANSITION REMEMBER THE WISDOM OF THE MIDWIFE BREATHE SHE SAYS AND THEN PUSH
I AM SORRY FOR WHAT I DID TO YOUR BROTHER
ONE DAY WHEN I GO TO HEAVEN TO BE JUDGED BY GOD
I WILL ASK TO SEE YOUR BROTHER
AND I WILL HUG HIM
AND I WILL ASK HIM FOR FORGIVENESS
WHEN WHITE SUPREMACISTS MARCH IN OUR STREETS TORCHES HIGH HOODS OFF
AND I HAVE TO
RECKON WITH THE FACT
THAT MY SON
IS GROWING UP IN A COUNTRY MORE DANGEROUS FOR HIM
THAN THE ONE I WAS GIVEN
TO MY GRANDFATHER'S ARMS PAPA JI DRIED MY TEARS GAVE ME THE WORDS OF GURU NANAK THE FOUNDER OF THE SIKH
TO MY MOTHER AND SAID I CAN'T BUT SHE WAS ALREADY POURING MY GRANDFATHER'S PRAYER IN MY EAR
THE HOT WINDS
CANNOT TOUCH YOU
YOU ARE BRAVE SHE SAID
YOU ARE BRAVE
AND
KING MANDELA THEY TAUGHT A LOT ABOUT HOW TO LOVE OTHERS AND OPPONENTS
THEY DIDN'T TALK A LOT ABOUT LOVING OURSELVES
THIS IS A FEMINIST INTERVENTION
YES YES
INNOVATIVE OUT OF THE BOX DISCOVERY IS JUST FINDING THE UNKNOWN
I HAVE WITH THEM LET'S TRY AND EXPERIENCE IT
HIDE THE CONTACTS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE THIS MAKES IT MORE
SO THAT I CAN CONTACT THEM NOW SUDDENLY THINGS CHANGE AND IT BECOMES INTERESTING BECAUSE
WHEN YOU LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN PERSON SO IF I AM LOOKING FOR A DOCTOR IT WOULD ACTUALLY RETURN A COUNT OF HOW MANY
HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN YOUR CONTACTS AWAY FROM YOU AS IT IS THEY ARE USING THEM TO SUGGEST AND BUILD YOUR OWN NETWORKS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS WE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING SOMETHING MORE VALUABLE
AM NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND OR LOOK EXACTLY OF WHERE I CAN FIND THIS GUY
LOOK FOR A SURGEON WHEN I LOOK FOR
A TUTOR WHEN I LOOK FOR A GARDENER WHEN I LOOK FOR ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IN OUR DAILY LIVES I DON'T KNOW WHO TO ASK
BUT IF I GET A COUNT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE I CAN ASK
THINGS BECOME SUDDENLY EASY
TAG IS WHAT IS PUSHED TO ALL OF YOUR ADDRESS
HOW DO I LOOK FOR THESE PEOPLE AND AS A BUSINESS I WANT TO GET DISCOVERED I WANT
ONTO THE CLOUD AND WE MERGED THEM TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH ONE UNIQUE TAG SO IF GARY IS GOING TO BE CALLED A DOCTOR OR YOU ARE GOING TO BE
I COULD LITERALLY BE SAVED AS GARY TEDX AFTER
OUR CONTACTS AND THESE ARE TREASURES WE'VE NEVER LET THEM GO WE'VE PACKED THEM UP WE'VE SAVED THEM UP WE'VE TRANSPORTED THEM WE'VE WRITTEN THEN AROUND BUT WE'VE NEVER LET THEM GO BECAUSE THESE WERE OUR
TEN BUT LET ME SHOW YOU DESPITE THESE
SAVE DOCTORS AS DR OR YOU COULD HAVE IT AS DOC
AT THE END OF THE DAY I WOULD REALLY SAY AN ENTREPRENEUR OR A BUSINESS HAS MAJOR PROBLEM WHEN IT GOES TO MARKET THE TWO
A QUESTION WHAT IS REALLY A DISCOVERY AND WHAT IS AN
I PUT MYSELF FORWARD IN FRONT OF THEM LINKLADDER IS THE ONLY
MANY PEOPLE I GO TO CONFERENCES AND I JUST SAVE NUMBERS HERE AND THERE
I LITERALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DOCTORS THAT I ALREADY KNOW BUT JUST BECAUSE I HAVEN'T TAGGED THEM AS DOCTORS IN MY ADDRESS BOOK I CAN'T SEARCH THEM
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE TOOK ALL OF YOUR ADDRESSES
YOU WOULD ASK YOUR FRIENDS DO YOU KNOW A GOOD GUY YOU'D ASK OTHER
POSSESSION A MAN HAS YET THERE NOTHING DONE ON IT
THAT MAKES IT SEARCHABLE SO THE NEXT TIME I AM PICKING UP MY PHONE AND TRY TO LOOK FOR A
ME NOT KPMG HOW DO I GET IN FRONT OF
THIS IS WHAT WE THOUGHT IS THE
IS THE ROOTS OF OUR DISCOVERY THAT MADE US CREATE AN INTERESTING PRODUCT CALLED
BACK I WAS TRYING TO LOOK FOR A KNEE SURGEON FOR MY GRANDMOTHER IT POSED ME A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION
OF THE WAY IN WHICH HUMAN BEINGS ARE SHAPED BY THINGS THAT THEY DON'T SEE AND
OF SOLDIERS JUST IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD
NEIGHBOR WHO ANNOYS YOU BY CUTTING HIS LAWN ON SUNDAY MORNINGS
CARE ABOUT IT WHEN OIL WAS AT STAKE
MILITARY SPENDING FOUR PERCENT OF THE
LANE OR YOUR TEENAGE SON
OF MILITARY WEAPONS AND SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME
WHAT YOU SEE SOMETHING ELSE THE UNITED STATES THE HUB OF DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD THEY DON'T SEEM TO REALLY BE SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC
THESE CHRISTIANS ARE COMING TO KILL US THIS IS
ALL BECAUSE OF OIL YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT YOU TALK ABOUT IT IT'S IN THE FOREFRONT OF YOUR MIND ALWAYS YOU
ALL AROUND THE WORLD THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES THAT AREN'T VERY
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING AND THINKING ABOUT
BE THINKING NUMBER ONE THIS INCURSION INTO YOUR LAND THESE PAST 20 YEARS AND BEFORE THE REASON ANYONE IS
ARAB MUSLIM LIVING IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN
YOU CAN GO SO FAR AND THIS IS WHAT I TELL MY STUDENTS
OFTEN ASK ME WHAT IS SOCIOLOGY AND I TELL THEM IT'S THE
OF THOUSANDS THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIAN DEATHS
AROUND THE WORLD AND THEY GOT FABULOUSLY WEALTHY IN DOING
ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE YOU CAN WALK A
YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG YOU'RE GENERALIZING IT'S WRONG YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
YOU GO THERE IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT YOU
ON IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ENTIRE ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT'S DEPENDENT ON THAT OIL FOREIGN OIL
AGO CHINA HAD BEEN THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE WORLD AND THEY
SURE WHEN THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN
I'M NOT EVEN SURE IT WAS TAKEN AT THE SAME MOMENT
AS THE BIRD'S EYE VIEW
IN MY LAB WE DEVELOP TOOLS
TO TRAVEL NOT ONLY IN SPACE BUT ALSO THROUGH TIME
THE KIND OF QUESTION WE'RE ASKING
IT IS ACTUALLY A LOG BOOK WHICH IS REPRESENTATIVE OF MANY JOURNEYS OF THAT PERIOD I'M EXTRAPOLATING IF I HAVE
EACH STEP THAT WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT WE ACTUALLY CONVERGE TOWARD A SINGLE STORY OF VENICE BUT PROBABLY WE CAN ACTUALLY RECONSTRUCT A FULLY
OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION METHOD THAT CAN BE USED FOR PRINTED MANUSCRIPTS THEY DO NOT WORK
THE OBJECTIVE OF TRANSFORMING THIS IMMENSE ARCHIVE INTO A GIANT INFORMATION SYSTEM
ALL THESE I CAN EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM THESE OF COURSE THE MORE YOU GO IN THE PAST THE LESS INFORMATION YOU WILL HAVE SO IT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH SO I CAN DO WHAT HISTORIANS DO I CAN
WELL ON THE HANDWRITTEN DOCUMENT SO THE SOLUTION IS ACTUALLY TO TAKE INSPIRATION FROM ANOTHER DOMAIN
THIS QUESTION WITH ONE OR TWO OR THREE DAYS' PRECISION
AND HOW SHOULD WE COMMUNICATE THIS NEW RESEARCH TO A LARGE AUDIENCE AGAIN VENICE IS EXTRAORDINARY FOR THAT WITH THE MILLIONS OF VISITORS THAT COME EVERY YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO TRY TO INVENT THE MUSEUM OF THE FUTURE
EUROPEAN CONTEXT SO THE IDEA IS ALSO TO DOCUMENT ALL THE THINGS THAT WORKED AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL
SPEECH RECOGNITION THIS IS A DOMAIN OF SOMETHING THAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE WHICH CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE SIMPLY BY PUTTING ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS
ABOUT VENICE THAT ITS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY VERY BUREAUCRATIC THEY'VE
OF A FACADE I CAN CONSIDER IT'S NOT JUST THAT PARTICULAR BUILDING BUT PROBABLY IT ALSO
SHARES THE SAME GRAMMAR
OF BUILDINGS WHERE WE LOST ANY INFORMATION
SO IF WE WANT TO CONSTRUCT TIME MACHINE WE NEED TWO THINGS
STORY OF VENICE MAYBE THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MAP MAYBE THERE ARE SEVERAL MAPS THE SYSTEM SHOULD ALLOW FOR THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A NEW FORM OF UNCERTAINTY WHICH IS REALLY NEW FOR THIS TYPE OF GIANT DATABASES
DIFFERENT YOU CAN CLICK ON IT AND IF YOU CLICK ON IT YOU CAN ZOOM IN ON ALMOST ANY PLACE ON THE EARTH
VERY GOOD MODEL
OF A LANGUAGE WHICH IS USED IF YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD MODEL OF A DOCUMENT HOW WELL THEY ARE STRUCTURED AND THESE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS THEY ARE WELL STRUCTURED IN MANY CASES
IF YOU DIVIDE THIS HUGE ARCHIVE INTO SMALLER SUBSETS WHERE A SMALLER SUBSET ACTUALLY SHARES SIMILAR FEATURES
THEN THERE'S A CHANCE OF SUCCESS
TO BUILD SOMETHING LIKE GOOGLE MAPS OF THE PAST OR FACEBOOK OF THE PAST WE NEED TO ENLARGE THIS SPACE WE NEED TO MAKE THAT LIKE A RECTANGLE HOW DO WE DO THAT ONE WAY
SO HOW CAN WE DETECT AND CORRECT THESE INCONSISTENCIES HOW CAN WE REPRESENT THAT FORM OF UNCERTAINTY IT'S DIFFICULT
THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGE OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS ONE IS QUALIFYING QUANTIFYING AND REPRESENTING UNCERTAINTY AND INCONSISTENCY AT EACH STEP OF THIS PROCESS
WE CAN SAY THAT RESEARCH IN THE HUMANITIES IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO
AN EVOLUTION WHICH IS MAYBE SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED TO LIFE SCIENCES 30 YEARS AGO
IT'S REALLY
A QUESTION OF SCALE
WE SEE
PROJECTS
WHICH ARE MUCH BEYOND ANY SINGLE RESEARCH TEAM CAN DO
AND THIS IS REALLY NEW FOR THE HUMANITIES WHICH VERY OFTEN
TAKE THE HABIT OF WORKING
IN SMALL GROUPS
OR
ONLY WITH A COUPLE OF RESEARCHERS
WHEN YOU VISIT THE ARCHIVIO DI STATO YOU FEEL THIS IS BEYOND WHAT ANY SINGLE TEAM CAN DO AND THAT SHOULD BE A JOINT AND COMMON EFFORT
SO WHAT WE MUST
THAT GOES OUT EVERY BOAT THAT COMES IN YOU HAVE EVERY CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IN THE CITY THIS IS ALL THERE WE ARE SETTING UP A 10 YEAR DIGITIZATION PROGRAM
THINK OF IT FROM AN INFORMATION POINT OF VIEW THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE INFORMATION
BUT THE BUILDING DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY YOU SEE LAST YEAR BEFORE WE ARRIVED OUT OF 832 STUDENTS
I CAN SHOW YOU MANY IMAGES LIKE THIS ONE THAT SURROUND OUR SCHOOLS
A WAY TO TRANSFORM UNDER PERFORMING SCHOOLS BUT ACTUALLY SHOW A WAY TO TRANSFORM ALL SCHOOLS AND DESIGN A FUTURE OF EDUCATION THAT WE ALL CAN BE PART OF IT STARTS AND
ISN'T TECHNOLOGY ISN'T POVERTY OR ECONOMIC OR FAMILY BACKGROUND IT'S THE QUALITY OF THE TEACHER THAT STANDS IN FRONT OF HIM OR HER THINK ABOUT THAT QUALITY TEACHING TRUMPS POVERTY
AND LEARNING AND THE MINUTE WE PUSH THIS CONVERSATION A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY COULD PLAY A ROLE IN THE CLASSROOM PARENTS AND POLICYMAKERS ALIKE BECOME CONCERNED THAT WE'RE CREATING
SAID WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE BELIEVED WAS POSSIBLE AND HIS PROOF POINT WAS SO POWERFUL THAT AFTER HE DID THAT A GENERATION OF PILOTS AFTER HIM ATTEMPTED THE SAME AND SUCCEEDED BECAUSE THEY THEN KNEW THAT IT WASN'T IMPOSSIBLE
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE NUMBER OF CHRONICALLY FAILING SCHOOLS WHEN WE SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THE BAR ON WHAT OUR KIDS ARE EXPECTED TO LEARN AND TO KNOW IN ORDER TO BE INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE
BENJAMIN BLOOM A RESEARCHER THIRTY YEARS AGO DID SOME AMAZING RESEARCH THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES US A CLUE A WINDOW ON WHAT THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION COULD LOOK LIKE HE STUDIED A GROUP OF ELEMENTARY STUDENTS
WHAT INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES ARE WORKING WELL WITH WHICH GROUPS WHICH KIDS ARE WORKING WELL WITH WHAT INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES AND THEN THE THIRD THING WE DO IS WE SIT DOWN WITH THESE TEACHERS ONE ON ONE EVERY TWO WEEKS AND WE ASK THEM A
ACCELERATE AND DECELERATE THEIR LEARNING AT DIFFERENT TIMES GET STUCK UNSTUCK AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CURRICULUM AND SO WHAT WE DO WITH THIS DATA IS WE CAN SEE TRENDS AND ON THAT REAL TIME DATA WE GIVE THEM REAL TIME FEEDBACK
A 4TH GRADE CURRICULUM WE'LL FIND AT THE END OF THE YEAR THEY'RE NOT READY TO ADVANCE SO RATHER THAN OPTIMIZE THIS BROKEN SYSTEM WE DECIDED TO BLOW
THIS COMBINATION OF DAILY FEEDBACK AND BI WEEKLY SIT DOWNS ENABLES US
TO COACH AND MENTOR TEACHERS OVER A HUNDRED TIMES INDIVIDUALLY IN A GIVEN SCHOOL YEAR YOU'D HAVE TO BE A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE OR A HOLLYWOOD ACTOR
TO GET THAT KIND OF COACHING IN YOUR CAREER BUT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE ELEVATING THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING THAT'S HOW WE TAKE
HOW DO WE HELP HIM SYSTEMICALLY SO THAT EVERY JALEN IN EVERY ZIP CODE NOT ONLY DREAMS THEIR DREAM BUT REALIZES THEIR DREAM IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND OUR FUTURE WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE PAST
A 9 CHANCE OF MAKING HIS DREAM SO THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION RESTS FOR US ON ONE SINGLE QUESTION
VERY WORST PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE SERVING OUR MOST DESPERATE CHILDREN
AND WHY START THERE
IF WE DON'T DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THOSE CHILDREN
WE'LL NEVER HAVE A FUTURE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN
BUT WHAT DOES THE BOTTOM LOOK LIKE
ALSO TO EXTEND THEIR LEARNING CURVE TO FIGURE OUT NOW WHAT TO DO NEXT
YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS MODEL WOULD BE GREAT FOR STUDENTS DIFFERENT MODES OF INSTRUCTION MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE DIFFERENT PACING
BUT HOW DOES A TEACHER BEGIN TO TEACH IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IN THE OLD
AND THESE COMMON CORE STANDARDS WILL BE BENCHMARKED TO THE VERY BEST IN THE WORLD TO EDUCATION SYSTEMS LIKE SINGAPORE AND SOUTH KOREA FINLAND
THE VERY BEST IN BLENDED SCHOOL TURNAROUND DESIGN TO THE VERY WORST SCHOOLS TO CREATE A POWERFUL PROOF POINT AT THE VERY BOTTOM THAT WOULD SERVE AS A PROOF POINT NOT ONLY FOR THIS SCHOOL AND ITS COMMUNITY BUT FOR THE CITY THE STATE AND MAYBE EVEN THE NATION
OUR INSPIRATION FOR THIS WAS CHUCK YEAGER
REAL TIME DATA RAPID FEEDBACK CONSTANT PROTOTYPING THESE THREE THINGS HAVE ENABLED OTHER INDUSTRIES TO COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THEMSELVES
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THIS KIND OF GROWTH IF THEY'RE EVER GOING TO CATCH UP
AND LEARNING STYLE I DARE YOU TO FIND ANOTHER INDUSTRY THAT HAS CHANGED SO LITTLE IN A HUNDRED YEARS
WE COULD HAVE GONE TO ANY ZIP CODE IN AMERICA THAT'S IN THE BOTTOM 25 INCOME WISE AND THE CHANCES OF THOSE KIDS GETTING A COLLEGE DEGREE BY AGE 25
SELF DRIVING CARS I SAW THE CONCEPT FIRST IN THE DARPA GRAND
IT WAS THAT HUMANS WERE DRIVING CARS THANK YOU {NS}
WASTING YOUR TIME ON YOUR DAILY COMMUTE
LIKE THIS AND THEN I DECIDED I'D DEDICATE MY LIFE TO SAVING ONE MILLION PEOPLE EVERY
ERROR AND NOT MACHINE ERROR AND CAN THEREFORE BE PREVENTED BY
DRIVING ACCIDENTS ARE THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG
CULTURE OF SELFLESSNESS I'LL MAKE THEM PLAY FOR EACH OTHER SO IF
IS AND THE RESTORATION THAT WE'VE DONE TO OUR DOWNTOWN AND RIVERFRONT AREAS IT'S HUGE SO I'M LIKE WHAT
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO
WE'LL CLOSE OFF
THAT BLOCK OF MLK WE'RE
GOING TO LINE UP A TABLE
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE
WE'RE GOING TO SPONSOR SOME FOOD AND WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMUNITY
TO BRING IN FOOD AS WELL JUST LIKE A POTLUCK
AND WE'RE GOING TO INVITE BOTH SIDES TO THE TABLE
SO WE CAN LET THEM KNOW HEY WE WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORY
YOU MATTER AS WELL YOU MAY NOT
SO WHEN A CITY ALSO STARTS WITH LEADERSHIP IT STARTS AT OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IT STARTS WITH OUR BOSSES IT STARTS WITH OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS
WHO NEVER GOT MUCH PLAYING TIME ALL EQUAL
THEM INTO LITTLE POCKETS OF THE CITY YOU
HAVE TO PICK THEM UP
SEE ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT
IS AN INITIATIVE THAT A NON PROFIT HERE IS LEADING
AND I'M GRATEFUL TO BE A PART OF IT
WE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE DOWNTOWN ON
MARTIN LUTHER KING BOULEVARD ON ONE SIDE OF MLK
THERE'S MILLER PLAZA BUSINESS PEOPLE GO THERE THEY EAT THEY TALK THEY NETWORK
ACCOLADES FASTEST INTERNET IN THE WORLD NATION WORLD I DON'T KNOW IT'S FAST
TO BRING IN LARGE CORPORATIONS AND BRING IN TONS OF JOBS AND GIVE THEM TAX BREAKS AND INCENTIVES FOR THAT BUT WHAT
THEY SELECTED UP AND COMING EMERGING LEADERS IN THE CITY AND THEY PAIRED US TOGETHER
ONCE A MONTH THEY TOOK ONE
MENTOR
WITH EIGHT DIFFERENT PROT G S AND
SAT THEM AROUND A TABLE
AND THAT MENTOR JUST POURED KNOWLEDGE INTO US
HE TOLD US
YOU RUN AND YOU PICK HIM UP THANK YOU
IT ON BIG DEAL IF WE HAVE ENTREPRENEURS OR SINGLE ENTREPRENEUR WHO'S DOING AWESOME THINGS IN THIS CITY BUT IF HE HOLDS ON TO THAT KNOWLEDGE AND NEVER SHARES THOSE THINGS
INCENTIVE TO HIRE THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REPORTED THAT SINCE THE 1970S 55 OF THE OLD JOBS AND 66 OF THE NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED BY SMALL BUSINESSES
IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST GO ALONE BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR YOU TAKE OTHERS WITH YOU SO WHAT WHAT IF WE CREATE A CULTURE OF SELFLESSNESS OK
{NS} EXACTLY IF YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST YOU'RE THE LAST BUT I BELIEVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE CITY IT'S THE COMPLETE
HAVE THANKSGIVING MEAL WITH YOUR FAMILY SO BREAK BREAD WITH US
WAS COACH JASON GILLESPIE
SEE I PLAYED AT A SCHOOL CALLED BLUEFIELD COLLEGE A LITTLE SMALL SCHOOL ABOUT 45 MINUTES OUTSIDE OF VIRGINIA TECH
BUT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE A SMALL SCHOOL
WE HAD A LOT OF NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ACCOLADES
WE LED THE NATION IN SCORING
WE BEAT THREE DIVISION I TEAMS MY SENIOR YEAR
WENT TO AUBURN UNIVERSITY ALMOST BEAT AUBURN AND IF ANYBODY FOLLOWS BASKETBALL THEY KNOW THAT BIG TEAMS LIKE AUBURN CALL LITTLE TEAMS LIKE BLUEFIELD DRAG THEM UP THERE SO THEY CAN BEAT THEM BY 40 POINTS
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS TEAM
GET BONUSES OR INCENTIVES FOR YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE BUT YOU GOT A BONUS OR INCENTIVE EVERY TIME YOU HELPED OUT YOUR CO WORKER YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR
IN A LOT OF WAYS ONE WAY IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE ANY TIME I TELL SOMEBODY I PLAYED AT BLUEFIELD COLLEGE THEY SAY THE SAME THING AS WHEN I SAY I'M FROM CHATTANOOGA WHERE'S THAT {LG}
THEM INTO LITTLE CORNERS AND POCKETS OF THE CITY AND HOPE THE TOURISTS DON'T SEE THEM WHEN THEY COME INTO TOWN IT CAN BE EASY TO DO THAT IT'S
WHAT KIND OF CONNECTIONS YOU NEED TO MAKE HE GAVE
AS A COMMUNITY BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE UNDERPRIVILEGED NEIGHBORHOODS WHAT ABOUT THE HOMELESS WHAT ABOUT THE
THE STAR PLAYERS THE SAME WAY HE TREATED THE GUY SITTING
ANY REASON
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE
YOU RUN AND YOU PICK HIM UP
WE
REALIZED THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO MAXIMIZE OUR POTENTIAL
IF WE WERE GOING TO WIN WHICH WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
WE HAD TO BE SELFLESS
WE HAD TO PUT THE MAN NEXT TO US
AHEAD
BECAUSE I THINK WE ACTUALLY NEED HACKERS
SICK BUT THEY ALSO FIND THOSE HIDDEN THREATS IN OUR WORLD AND THEY MAKE
NO INTRODUCTION TODAY BUT SIX YEARS AGO THEY WERE NOT MUCH MORE THAN
YOU DO THEN INDEED MANY HACKERS DO NOT RESIST THOSE
YOU COULD READ YOUR EX'S EMAILS OR ADD A COUPLE ZEROS TO
LIKE THIS LIKE TODAY EVEN AS GOVERNMENTS
THE SAME PEOPLE WHO DEMONIZE HACKING ALSO UTILIZE
US TO FIX THINGS OR DEMAND SOMETHING BETTER AND I THINK WE
AND THE BEAUTY ABOUT HACKERS THEY JUST CAN'T SEE
BUT THE CHOICES THEY MAKE HAVE DRAMATIC OUTCOMES
FIND THE WEAKER ELEMENTS IN OUR WORLD AND MAKE US FIX IT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR WHEN ANOTHER SECURITY RESEARCHER CALLED KYLE LOVETT DISCOVERED GAPING HOLE IN THE
WE USE EVERY DAY THIS IS WHAT KHALIL DID KHALIL IS A PALESTINIAN HACKER FROM THE WEST
AND OFFLINE WORLD SINCE THEN THEY'VE GONE AFTER MANY
BROKE THE LAW BUT THEY ALSO FORCED THAT COMPANY TO FIX THEIR PRODUCT
CONNECT TO THESE DEVICES OVER THE INTERNET AND DOWNLOAD DOCUMENTS FROM HARD DRIVES ATTACHED TO THOSE
WITH THE EXCHANGE HE TOOK TO USE HIS OWN DISCOVERY
I REMEMBER ONE LATE NIGHT I FOUND A BIT OF PHP
MAGNIFYING GLASS FOR ISSUES THAT WE ARE NOT AS AWARE OF BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE
THEY ATTEMPT TO DO BY SETTING UP ALL YOU CAN EAT SURVEILLANCE
HER SO I STARTED SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON HACKER CHAT ROOMS AND ONLINE
HE SAID IS THE TALENT OUR NATION NEEDS WELL HACKERS IN THE BACK ROW
POTENTIAL IN FACT HE WAS THERE TO GIVE A HIRING PITCH
ALL AROUND THE WORLD FROM MY HOMETOWN OF TEL AVIV TO ADELAIDE
HACKERS ARE A FORCE FOR SOCIAL POLITICAL AND MILITARY
MOST PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT A HACKER FOUND A WAY TO LITERALLY MAKE ATMS THROW MONEY AT
KEEP EXPECTING THEM TO BE THE BAD GUYS HOW CAN THEY BE THE HEROES
GRAB THE SPOTLIGHT FOR CAUSES THEY SUPPORT
VILLAIN AND SO THE SYRIAN ELECTRONIC ARMY IS A PRO ASSAD GROUP OF HACKERS WHO SUPPORT HIS CONTENTIOUS
PEOPLE'S FILES BUT THEY DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING THEY LEFT A NOTE
SIDE OF THE FENCE BUT IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW NOW
THEIR OWN PLAYING FIELD TO ME THAT REPRESENTS HOPE FOR THE PAST THREE
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IF THE INTERNET DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU TRY TO REMOVE THINGS FROM IT
DOWN TO EGYPT'S INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND HAD THEM PHYSICALLY KILL THE
RESEARCH INSTEAD HE BELIEVED THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DEMO A
THINK IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO BLINDLY FIGHT ALL HACKERS IS TO GO AGAINST THE POWER YOU CANNOT CONTROL AT THE
DUE TO SOME MISCOMMUNICATIONS HIS REPORT WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED
I MIGHT ADD THEY ARE NOW SHAPING THE WORLD'S STAGE
WE NEED THEM TO DO JUST THAT BECAUSE AFTER
THAT MATTER TO US ALL THE REALITY IS HACKERS CAN DO LOT MORE THAN BREAK THINGS
HAVE DONE A LOT OF THINGS BUT THEY HAVE ALSO IMPACTED CIVIL LIBERTIES INNOVATION
CORRUPTION ABUSE THEY'VE HACKED POPES AND POLITICIANS AND I THINK THEIR EFFECT IS LARGER THAN SIMPLE DENIAL OF SERVICE
IT PROPERLY HE WAS DENIED THE BOUNTY USUALLY PAID OUT FOR SUCH DISCOVERIES
TRICK AND I WAS JUST SCRIPT KIDDIE BACK THEN BUT TO ME THAT TRICK
BOND VILLAIN WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE BUT HE CHOSE TO SHOW THE WORLD
BUT WHEN THE NET WENT COMPLETELY DOWN TELECOMIX BROUGHT IN THE BIG GUNS THEY FOUND EUROPEAN SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT STILL HAD 20 YEAR OLD ANALOG DIAL UP ACCESS
A WOMAN YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A ONE IN THREE CHANCE OF BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER EVERYBODY KNOWS SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER
HAD BEEN DOING HIS OWN BITS OF RESEARCH AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD AND THAT HE'D LEARNED FROM STUDYING THE
TOLD THAT THERE'S A BACKLOG OF ABOUT 20 YEARS OF DRUGS THAT ARE WAITING TO BE TESTED BUT CAN'T BE FUNDED
TO LET THE RESEARCH DRIVE THE FUNDING NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND SO IN ORDER TO GET STARTED LET ME TELL YOU HOW YOU GET A DRUG FINANCED IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE IN YOUR
GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT WE THINK COULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY RESEARCH FOR CANCER AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS GETS DONE
SOME MATH AND IT TURNED OUT YOU COULD MAKE THIS WORK BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE IT WORK YOU NEED ABOUT 80 TO 150 DRUGS NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S PLENTY OF DRUGS THAT ARE WAITING TO BE TESTED
PARIS AND SAN FRANCISCO LOTS OF DIFFERENT FOLKS WORKING ON THIS TO TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN REALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN WE'RE
THE LABORATORY FOR FINANCIAL ENGINEERING AT MIT WHERE I ALSO HAVE POSITION AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CANCER
YOU'RE A SCIENTIST YOU'RE NOT LIKE ME AND YOU'VE DEVELOPED A NEW COMPOUND THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE THERAPEUTIC FOR SOMEBODY WITH
WITH ALL THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF DRUGS THAT START THE PROCESS ACTUALLY COME OUT THE OTHER
SO WE DID THIS MATH AND WE FIGURED OUT OK WELL YOU NEED ABOUT 80 TO SAY 150 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
YOU TEST TO SEE IF THE DRUG'S EFFECTIVE AND YOU GIVE IT TO PEOPLE WITH CANCER AND YOU SEE IF IT MAKES THEM BETTER AND THAT'S ALSO A HIGHER
TO GET THE DRUG TESTED AND THE WAY THE DRUG GETS TESTED IS THROUGH SERIES OF BASICALLY EXPERIMENTS THROUGH THESE LARGE THEY'RE CALLED TRIALS
IT'S A VERY VERY RISKY TRIAL POSITION AND THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY HARD TO GET FUNDING BUT TO FIRST APPROXIMATION THAT'S ACTUALLY THE PROPOSAL YOU HAVE TO FUND THESE THINGS FROM THE EARLY STAGES ON IT TAKES A LONG
ASKED ME IF I'D WANT TO MAYBE WORK WITH HIM A BIT WORK ON SOME OF THE MATH AND THE ANALYTICS AND SEE IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT SOMETHING WE
TIME THEY GO THROUGH A PHASE OF APPROVAL THEY GAIN VALUE MOST OF THEM DON'T MAKE IT BUT FEW OF THEM DO
DAYS THEY HEARD THE REPORTS FROM THOSE FIVE WORK STREAMS AND TALKED ABOUT IT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE THIS HAPPEN SAT ACROSS THE TABLE FROM EACH OTHER AND HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS
WAS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A BIG BOTTLENECK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP NEW DRUGS AND THE REASON IT'S DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP NEW DRUGS IS BECAUSE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT
US TOGETHER CAN ACTUALLY FUND HUNDREDS OF TRIALS AND GET PAID WELL FOR DOING IT AND SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES LIKE MY DAD THANK YOU
TO START A FUND BUT WE WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO THIS BECAUSE AGAIN I'M NOT A SCIENTIST I CAN'T BUILD A DRUG
GO TO DIE IT'S VERY HARD TO FOR THEM TO GET THROUGH THERE AND OF COURSE IF YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH THERE YOU CAN'T GET TO THE LATER STAGES
WORK STREAM ON THE REGULATORY ASPECTS COULD YOU START A WORK STREAM ON HOW YOU WOULD MANAGE SO MANY PROJECTS
CANCER IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY TOUCHES EVERYBODY IF YOU'RE MAN IN THE US YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A ONE IN TWO CHANCE OF BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER DURING YOUR LIFETIME
GOT RID OF THE RISK BUT NOW WE NEED A LOT OF CAPITAL AND YOU CAN ONLY GET THAT KIND OF CAPITAL IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND PHILANTHROPIES DON'T HAVE
AND GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND THIS AND WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG WHAT ARE ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT MIGHT GET IN THE WAY AND
IF IT ACTUALLY MAKES THEM SICK IN OTHER WORDS ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS JUST SO SEVERE THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH GOOD IT DOES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WORTH IT
PRODUCE LOW RISK BONDS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO BOND HOLDERS THAT WOULD GIVE YOU YIELDS OF ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT PERCENT AND YOU COULD PRODUCE
ATTRACTIVE TO A VENTURE CAPITALIST THEY WANT TO MAKE THOSE BIG BETS AND GET THOSE BILLION {NS} BUT IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER FOLKS THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED
AND WHAT WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS HOW WE CAN HELP MORE PEOPLE LIKE MY DAD BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT RAISING MONEY TO FUND CANCER
WE KNOW ABOUT FINANCIAL ENGINEERING AT THEM LET'S SEE IF WE CAN USE ALL THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THESE
YEARS I'LL TELL YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE ONE OF THE BLUE ONES DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD DEAL FOR
EXPERTS FROM EVERY FIELD WE THOUGHT WOULD BE IMPORTANT INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE THAT RUN RESEARCH CENTERS
IT WE DID BUNCH OF EXPERIMENTS AND THEN WE SAID LET'S REALLY TRY TO TEST IT WE SPENT THE
THEN WE DID A LITTLE MORE MATH AND WE SAID OK WELL THAT'S FUND OF ABOUT THREE TO 15 BILLION DOLLARS SO WE KIND OF CREATED A NEW PROBLEM BY SOLVING THE OLD ONE
WE STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE AS DRUGS WHAT IF WE START THINKING ABOUT THEM AS FINANCIAL ASSETS
GUYS ARE SCIENTISTS EITHER WE DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE CANCER DRUG BUT WE KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RISK MITIGATION AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FINANCIAL ENGINEERING AND SO WE STARTED THINKING WHAT COULD
NEW DRUG THAT HAPPENED TO BE SPECIALLY FORMULATED AND VERY GOOD FOR HIS PARTICULAR KIND OF CANCER THERE ARE OVER 200 KINDS OF CANCER
GOVERNMENT DEVELOPERS
THEY HAVE MONEY
AND POWER
THOSE ARE INVISIBLE
SO THEY HIRE US TO VISUALIZE THEIR POWER AND MONEY
BY MAKING MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE THAT IS OUR PROFESSION EVEN HISTORICALLY IT'S THE SAME EVEN NOW WE ARE DOING THE SAME
SO I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT WE ARE NOT WORKING
SO I WENT THERE AND ALSO I PROPOSED TO THE PRIESTS WHY DON'T WE REBUILD THE CHURCH OUT OF PAPER TUBES AND HE SAID OH GOD ARE YOU CRAZY AFTER A
I COMPLETED THE POMPIDOU CENTER IN METZ IT'S A VERY POPULAR
IT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO DO IT THEN ALSO IT WAS THE FACT OVER 500 KILOMETER COAST LINE WAS DAMAGED BY TSUNAMI THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FLAT AREA TO BUILD
OF THE TUBE FRAME AND THE CURTAIN HOWEVER SOME OF
I BROUGHT MY JAPANESE STUDENTS TO WORK WITH THE CHINESE STUDENTS IN ONE MONTH WE COMPLETED 9 CLASSROOMS OVER 500 SQUARE METERS IT'S STILL USED EVEN AFTER THE CURRENT EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA
IN 2009 IN ITALY L'AQUILA
ALSO THEY HAD A BIG EARTHQUAKE AND THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PHOTO
FORMER PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI
AND JAPANESE FORMER FORMER
OF ARCHITECTS
THEN PEOPLE NEED SOME TEMPORARY HOUSING BUT THERE ARE NO ARCHITECTS WORKING THERE BECAUSE WE ARE TOO BUSY WORKING FOR PRIVILEGED PEOPLE
SO I THOUGHT EVEN
AS ARCHITECTS
WE CAN BE INVOLVED IN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF TEMPORARY HOUSING WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER
SO THAT IS WHY I STARTED WORKING IN DISASTER AREAS
TUBE AND THIS EXHIBITION IS THE FIRST ONE I DID USING PAPER TUBES 1986 MUCH MUCH LONGER BEFORE PEOPLE STARTED TALKING ABOUT
KIND HOLDING MY MODEL I PROPOSED A BIG REBUILDING A TEMPORARY MUSIC HALL BECAUSE L'AQUILA IS VERY FAMOUS FOR MUSIC
AND ALL THE CONCERT HALLS WERE DESTROYED SO MUSICIANS WERE MOVING OUT
SO I PROPOSED TO THE MAYOR I'D LIKE TO REBUILD THE TEMPORARY AUDITORIUM HE SAID AS LONG AS YOU BRING YOUR MONEY YOU CAN DO IT AND I WAS VERY LUCKY MR BERLUSCONI BROUGHT G8
WE WERE PART OF THE EXHIBITION EVEN IF MY FRIEND WANTED TO SEE ME THEY HAD TO BUY TICKET TO SEE ME {LG}
HOUSE IS EXACTLY THE SAME BUT MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE MANY OF THE PEOPLE WANT TO STAY HERE FOREVER I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT NOW I AM WORKING
THEY STARTED PROVIDING ALUMINUM PIPES ALUMINUM BARRACKS VERY EXPENSIVE THEY SOLD THEM OUT FOR MONEY THEN CUTTING TREES AGAIN SO I PROPOSED MY IDEA
OUR PARENTS SAY IT TO US EVERY DAY TO MAKE US FEEL GOOD BUT BECAUSE WE TRULY HAVE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL WE HAVE YET TO REALIZE THAT WE NEED TO USE TO ROCK THIS WORLD I ANTICIPATE THE NEXT TEN YEARS WILL BE FILLED WITH LOTS OF
OF WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER THIS WILL PASS IT MIGHT
I'VE FAILED IN BUSINESS AS A FRIEND AS A STUDENT AND WHAT'S REALLY HELPED ME WAS TO THINK WHERE DID I GO WRONG WHAT CAN I DO BETTER AND IT'S MADE ME A BETTER PERSON A BETTER BUSINESSWOMAN FRIEND SISTER DAUGHTER A MORE TUNED
WITH FAILURE AND SOCIETY'S VIEW OF WHAT SMART MEANS AND IF LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS DO
IN THE WORLD SO I INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME AS WE FAIL FORWARD TOGETHER
MIDDLE SCHOOL
FOR MANY OF US IT'S THE TOUGHEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES
GIRLS AREN'T ALWAYS NICE TO EACH OTHER WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK OR AT LEAST WE THINK SO
WE'RE VERY INSECURE AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OURSELVES
PEOPLE REACT TO THESE MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS FOR SOME GIRLS PUBERTY'S IN THEIR FAVOR THEY HAVE THEIR CLIQUE THEY HAVE GREAT GRADES THEY'RE HAPPY AND THEY'LL SHOW IT
SOME GIRLS STRUGGLE TREMENDOUSLY THEY HAVE TROUBLE IN SCHOOL THEY CAN'T FIND THEIR GROUP OF FRIENDS AND THEY GO WITHIN THEIR OWN BUBBLE AND SOME PEOPLE PLAY IT COOL THEY HAVE GREAT GRADES AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS RIGHT
MIDDLE SCHOOL WAS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE FOR ME AND IT TOOK ME YEARS TO REALIZE IT
I WAS THE GIRL WHO STRUGGLED ACADEMICALLY DUE TO MANY LEARNING DIFFERENCES EVEN THOUGH I WOULD TRY SO HARD AND I COULDN'T FIND MY PEOPLE THAT GROUP OF GIRLS THAT I REALLY GOT ALONG WITH
I WAS UNDERMINED AND I WAS MISERABLE ABOUT MYSELF
BUT THE ONE THING I DID HAVE WAS AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT I HAD ALWAYS LIKED COMING UP WITH BUSINESS IDEAS NEVER EXACTLY FOLLOWING THROUGH BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO MEAN MUCH AT THE TIME
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD A HOBBY OR A PASSION EITHER I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A DARK HOLE THAT WAS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AS EACH DAY WENT BY
THE PRINCIPAL OF MY MIDDLE SCHOOL WAS AN AMAZING GUY WHO SAW THE POTENTIAL I HAD BEFORE I EVEN SAW IT
ONE DAY HE SAID TO ME FAIL FORWARD
FAIL
FAILURE AND SEEM TO ALWAYS BE SUCCEEDING ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WON'T DO WELL IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO APPROACH THEIR FAILURE THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY DID WRONG LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES WHO WILL DO WELL
TAKE THOSE LEMONS AND MAKE THE MOST KILLER LEMONADE YOU CAN THANK YOU {NS}
CAN'T INCH AWAY FROM THE FAILURE THAT'S TO COME YOU CAN'T AVOID IT YOU NEED TO APPROACH
BEFORE THE SPREAD OF COFFEE AND TEA THROUGH BRITISH CULTURE WHAT PEOPLE DRANK BOTH ELITE AND MASS FOLKS DRANK
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT COFFEEHOUSES FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN KIND OF ON THIS QUEST TO INVESTIGATE THIS
THINK OUR BREAKTHROUGH IDEAS YOU KNOW ARE LIKE THAT 40000 BRAND NEW INCUBATOR STATE OF THE ART
WONDERFUL ILLUMINATING MOMENT BUT IN FACT WHAT
COUPLE OF HOURS THEY ACTUALLY START PICKING UP THE SIGNAL BECAUSE THE SOVIETS MADE SPUTNIK VERY EASY TO TRACK IT WAS RIGHT AT 20 MHZ SO YOU COULD PICK IT UP REALLY EASILY BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS HOAX BASICALLY SO THEY MADE IT REALLY EASY TO
METAPHORS AND LANGUAGE STEERS US TOWARDS CERTAIN CONCEPTS OF IDEA CREATION WE
THEY GET PERMISSION THIS IS ALL A LITTLE SIDE PROJECT THAT HADN'T BEEN OFFICIALLY PART OF THEIR JOB DESCRIPTION THEY GET PERMISSION TO USE THE NEW YOU KNOW UNIVAC COMPUTER THAT TAKES UP AN ENTIRE ROOM THAT THEY'D JUST GOTTEN AT THE APL THEY RUN SOME MORE OF THE NUMBERS
FORERUNNER ON THE STREET IN ALL THESE PLACES THEY SEEM TO HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO KEEP CARS WORKING SO THEY STARTED TO THINK COULD WE BUILD A NEONATAL INCUBATOR THAT'S BUILT ENTIRELY OUT OF AUTOMOBILE
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS TURNS OUT THEY HAVE MAPPED THE EXACT TRAJECTORY OF THIS SATELLITE AROUND THE EARTH JUST FROM LISTENING TO THIS ONE LITTLE SIGNAL GOING OFF ON THIS LITTLE SIDE
OF PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY YOU KNOW BUILDING BARRICADES
THE OTHER WAY COULD YOU FIGURE OUT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION ON THE GROUND IF YOU KNEW THE LOCATION OF THE SATELLITE AND THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID WELL I GUESS MAYBE YOU COULD
ON YOU'VE FIGURED OUT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION OF SATELLITE ORBITING THE PLANET FROM A KNOWN LOCATION ON THE GROUND
IS KIND OF HISTORIC WE MAY BE THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES TO BE LISTENING TO THIS WE SHOULD RECORD IT AND SO THEY BRING IN THIS BIG CLUNKY ANALOG TAPE RECORDER AND
IS KIND OF AN EXPERT IN MICROWAVE RECEPTION AND HE'S GOT A LITTLE ANTENNAE SET UP WITH AN AMPLIFIER IN HIS OFFICE AND SO GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH GO BACK TO WEIFFENBACH'S OFFICE AND THEY START KIND OF NOODLING AROUND HACKING AS WE MIGHT CALL IT NOW
IT WAS A SPACE AS MATT RIDLEY TALKED ABOUT WHERE IDEAS COULD HAVE SEX THIS WAS THEIR CONJUGAL BED IN A
NETWORK OF NEURONS FIRING IN SYNC WITH EACH OTHER INSIDE YOUR BRAIN IT'S A NEW CONFIGURATION
THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE KNOW BY GETTING MODERN NEONATAL INCUBATORS INTO ANY
THE SPACES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY LED TO INNOVATION TEND TO LOOK
TO TACKLE THIS REALLY PRESSING PROBLEM OF YOU KNOW THE TERRIBLE PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH INFANT MORTALITY RATES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
BEFORE AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET YOUR BRAIN INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THESE NEW NETWORKS ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO FORM
EVEN DREAMED OF MEAN HERE YOU HAVE THESE GUYS WHO BASICALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST FOLLOWING THIS HUNCH THIS LITTLE PASSION THAT HAD DEVELOPED THEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTING THE COLD WAR
GREAT FOR YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND THEN SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG AND IT WILL BREAK AND IT WILL REMAIN BROKEN FOREVER
IS SHARED PATTERNS KIND OF SIGNATURE BEHAVIOR THAT SHOWS UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IN ALL OF THESE
TO A BUNCH OF SCIENCE LABS AROUND THE WORLD AND VIDEOTAPED EVERYONE AS THEY WERE DOING EVERY LITTLE BIT OF THEIR JOB SO WHEN THEY WERE SITTING IN FRONT OF THE MICROSCOPE WHEN THEY WERE TALKING TO THEIR COLLEAGUE AT THE WATER COOLER AND ALL THESE THINGS AND
OF AN IDEA SOMEBODY ELSE HAS THE OTHER HALF AND IF YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT THEY TURN INTO SOMETHING LARGER THAN THE SUM OF THEIR PARTS SO IN A SENSE WE OFTEN TALK
OF CREATIVITY AND WHAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE LOOKED AT BOTH ENVIRONMENTS LIKE THE COFFEEHOUSE I'VE LOOKED AT MEDIA ENVIRONMENTS LIKE THE WORLD WIDE WEB THAT HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY INNOVATIVE
VARIATIONS HERE WE COULD PROBABLY CALCULATE THE SPEED THAT THE SATELLITE IS TRAVELING IF WE DO LITTLE BASIC MATH HERE USING THE DOPPLER
A LOT OF THESE VALUES AND IT'S JUST WONDERFUL KIND OF TALE OF INNOVATION AND HOW IT HAPPENS IN UNLIKELY
IDEAS AND THE CULTURE WILL BE MORE INNOVATIVE BUT I THINK THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE THAT WE SHOULD SPEND AT LEAST AS MUCH TIME IF
WE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE SLOPE OF THE DOPPLER EFFECT TO FIGURE OUT THE POINTS AT WHICH THE SATELLITE IS CLOSEST TO OUR ANTENNAE AND THE POINTS AT WHICH IT'S FARTHEST AWAY THAT'S PRETTY COOL
A BUNCH OF SATELLITES AND USE IT TO TRACK OUR SUBMARINES AND FIGURE OUT THEIR LOCATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN COULD YOU WORK ON THAT
THEM TOGETHER INTO NEW FORMS AND WE CREATE SOMETHING NEW THAT'S REALLY WHERE INNOVATION
SAID OH THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE SEE I HAVE THESE NEW NUCLEAR SUBMARINES THAT I'M BUILDING AND
AN EXCELLENT IDEA FOR OUR ORGANIZATION IT WILL BE USEFUL IN 2020 COULD YOU JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME TO DO THAT NOW COUPLE OF COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE THEY HAVE INNOVATION TIME OFF 20 PERCENT TIME WHERE IN A
TO SHOW IT TO YOU NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE KIND OF STARBUCKS TOUR OF HISTORIC ENGLAND BUT
OF THEIR COLLEAGUES AND EVERYBODY'S LIKE NO I HADN'T THOUGHT OF DOING THAT THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA AND IT TURNS
IS THAT DARWIN IN A SENSE HAD THE IDEA HE HAD THE CONCEPT BUT WAS UNABLE OF FULLY THINKING IT YET AND THAT IS ACTUALLY HOW GREAT IDEAS OFTEN
THAT IN FACT THE KIND OF NETWORK PATTERNS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD MIMIC LOT OF THE NETWORK PATTERNS OF THE INTERNAL WORLD OF THE HUMAN
MORNING AND THE NEWS HAS JUST BROKEN ABOUT THIS SATELLITE THAT'S NOW ORBITING THE PLANET AND OF COURSE THIS IS NERD HEAVEN RIGHT THERE ARE ALL
GEEKS WHO ARE THERE THINKING OH MY GOSH THIS IS INCREDIBLE I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS HAPPENED AND TWO OF THEM TWO 20 SOMETHING RESEARCHERS AT THE APL ARE
IF NOT MORE HAS USED SAID DEVICE AND SAID SATELLITE SYSTEM TO LOCATE A NEARBY COFFEEHOUSE SOMEWHERE IN THE LAST {LG} IN THE LAST DAY OR LAST WEEK
OF DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT ARE TOGETHER DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS DIFFERENT INTERESTS JOSTLING WITH EACH OTHER BOUNCING OFF EACH OTHER THAT ENVIRONMENT IS IN FACT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT LEADS TO
THAT THERE'S AN INTERESTING PROBLEM BUT THEY DON'T QUITE HAVE THE TOOLS YET TO DISCOVER THEM THEY SPEND ALL THIS TIME
WHERE PEOPLE WOULD GET TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS DIFFERENT FIELDS OF EXPERTISE
AND SEE WHAT ARE THE ABUNDANT RESOURCES IN THESE DEVELOPING WORLD CONTEXTS AND WHAT THEY NOTICED WAS THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DVRS THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MICROWAVES BUT THEY SEEM TO DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF KEEPING THEIR CARS ON THE ROAD
PREMATURE BABIES WARM BASICALLY IT'S VERY SIMPLE WE CAN HALVE INFANT MORTALITY RATES IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE THESE ARE STANDARD IN ALL THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLDS
HUNCH CULTIVATING MECHANISMS IN AN ORGANIZATION BUT THAT'S A
THESE LITTLE BLEEP BLEEPS AND THEY START WRITING THE KIND OF DATE STAMP TIME STAMPS FOR EACH LITTLE BLEEP THAT THEY RECORD AND THEY THEY START THINKING WELL GOSH YOU KNOW WE'RE NOTICING SMALL
THEY'VE GOT THE IDEA WHAT HAPPENED ACTUALLY WHEN DUNBAR KIND OF LOOKED AT THE TAPE IS THAT IN FACT ALMOST ALL OF THE IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IDEAS DID NOT HAPPEN ALONE IN THE LAB IN FRONT OF THE
AT THE CAFETERIA TABLE HAVING AN INFORMAL CONVERSATION WITH A BUNCH OF THEIR COLLEAGUES AND THESE TWO GUYS ARE NAMED GUIER AND WEIFFENBACH AND THEY START TALKING AND ONE OF THEM SAYS HEY HAS ANYBODY TRIED TO LISTEN FOR THIS THING THERE'S THIS
THAT ARE MORE INNOVATIVE WE HAVE TO BUILD SPACES THAT STRANGELY ENOUGH LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE
A WHOLE SYSTEM OF SPARE PARTS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE ON THE GROUND EXPERTISE TO FIX THIS 40000 PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND
RECURRING PATTERNS THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT WE CAN TAKE AND KIND OF APPLY TO OUR OWN LIVES OR OUR OWN ORGANIZATIONS OR OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTS
DRINKING ALL DAY AND THEN YOU SWITCHED FROM A DEPRESSANT TO A STIMULANT IN YOUR
ACTUALLY ON POPULATION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BASIC ALGORITHM OF NATURAL SELECTION KIND OF POPS INTO HIS HEAD AND HE
BUT NOW THIS PLACED ME IN FACE OF DILEMMA WHAT TO BECOME WHEN I GREW UP A PHYSICIST OR AN ARCHAEOLOGIST AND WHAT DID I DO IN THE FACE OF THIS
THIS WAS OFTEN DONE UNDER VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT AT THE END OF A WORKING
ORGANIZING THEMSELVES AND NEW CULTURE A NEOLITHIC CULTURE AND THIS CULTURE WOULD GIVE RISE TO
TO LIVE IN THIS DESOLATE PLACE BECAUSE AT LEAST THERE THEY HAD SAFETY
A VERY TOUCHING STORY AND A STORY WHICH ILLUSTRATES HOW THE LESSONS OF THE PAST CAN STILL BE USEFUL TODAY
REVOLUTION DOMESTICATED ANIMALS WOULD
IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CRETE
IT WAS A SITE CALLED KARFI
AND KARFI WAS ONE OF THE LAST SETTLEMENTS OF THE SO CALLED MINOAN CIVILIZATION
NOW WORKING AT KARFI IMPLIED WAKING UP
MANY OF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT AND THAT IS PROBABLY A TIME MACHINE WELL FOR THE
THERE ALSO I WAS SURROUNDED BY HIGH TECH INSTRUMENTS AND IT WAS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT I MET A
AND OF THE DEVELOPMENTS THAT AROSE FROM THIS ENCOUNTER DEVELOPMENTS THAT PERHAPS EXPANDED THE EXISTING
AND BY COUNTING THE ATOMS IN OUR BODIES WE CAN ACTUALLY RECONSTRUCT OUR DIETARY HISTORIES
THEM IS THROUGH SOMETHING THAT MANY OF US LOVE TO DO BUT WE ALL HAVE TO DO
THESE METHODS FROM PHYSICS WERE APPLIED TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND THAT WAS THE STUDY OF PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS LIVING IN COASTAL AREAS IN SOUTHERN SCANDINAVIA IT ALL STARTED
HOW THEY MANAGED TO SURVIVE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT WHAT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY THEY HAD ACCESS
UNABLE TO LOCATE THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT NOR DID WE FIND ANY GOLD OR SILVER TREASURE
MONUMENTS
AND SO PERHAPS STONEHENGE IS PART OF A TRADITION THAT DATES BACK TO THE MESOLITHIC
NOW ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THIS
BUT IT IS CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO THINK
WAS A TV HERO MACGYVER NOW MACGYVER WAS A PHYSICIST AND HE USED HIS
JONES AND UNTIL TODAY I REMAIN A HUGE FAN OF BOTH
OF SOME FOODS IN SOME CULTURES IS PROMOTED WHEREAS THE CONSUMPTION OF THOSE SAME FOODS IN DIFFERENT CULTURES IS CONSIDERED TABOO BUT WE ARE ALSO WHAT WE EAT IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE
TO FIND A GOLDEN IDOL IN THE JUNGLES OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND TO FIND THESE ARTIFACTS YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
IN THE CASE OF THESE SOUTHERN SCANDINAVIANS LIVING NEAR THE COAST THEY WERE FISHING MARINE FISH COLLECTING
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SAMPLES ARE AND SHE DOES THIS THROUGH A PROCESS KNOWN AS RADIOCARBON DATING IN WHICH THE RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES OF THE ELEMENT CARBON ARE COUNTED AT THE LAB THERE WERE ALSO OTHER
OR IDEAS THAT SEEM TO BE RADICALLY OPPOSED IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE TO FIND THE CROSSING POINT
FOR THE NON RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES OF CARBON
THESE ARE SOME OF THE REAL QUESTIONS OF ARCHEOLOGY AND VERY IMPORTANT ARCHAEOLOGISTS WANT TO
FROM PHYSICS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS FROM ARCHEOLOGY THIS WAY I COULD COMBINE THEM
WE ARE DEVELOPING
THE TELEPATHY ONE RIGHT NOW
THAT
DEVICE
CAN OFFER
SAME MOMENTS
LIKE THESE
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND TURN ON AND
ANYONE COULD POSSIBLY COMPREHEND NOW AS EXCITING AS THAT SOUNDS WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING CYBER
ALL OF THESE THINGS KEEPING THEM WORKING BUT ONCE IN A WHILE PART OF MY JOB IS TO BREAK ONE OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE CYBER ISN'T JUST ABOUT DEFENSE
LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME PRETTY MUCH NO MATTER WHAT I DO MY JOB ALWAYS STARTS WITH SITTING DOWN WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF BINARY INFORMATION
THROUGH BINARY INFORMATION STARTS TO SEEM KIND OF EXCITING BUT HERE'S THE CATCH THIS IS HARD REALLY REALLY HARD AND HERE'S
NEW WEAPON IN THE EVOLVING THEATER OF CYBER WARFARE BUT FOR ALL OF US IT MEANS THAT CYBER ENGINEERS NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO BECOME FIRST RESPONDERS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
HEAT CLEAN WATER FOOD COMPUTERS CONTROL OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT EVERYTHING FROM MISSILE SILOS TO SATELLITES TO NUCLEAR DEFENSE NETWORKS
THIS WAS IT IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT RIGHT BUT I COULDN'T QUITE TELL I COULDN'T TELL WHAT THOSE ONES AND ZEROS REPRESENTED
BEGUN TO UNLOCK THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR MINDS TO PROCESS VISUAL INFORMATION IF WE TAKE THOSE SAME CONCEPTS AND TRANSLATE THEM INTO THREE DIMENSIONS
INCREDIBLE SO IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO TRANSLATE THESE BINARY PATTERNS TO VISUAL SIGNALS WE COULD REALLY UNLOCK THE POWER OF OUR BRAINS TO PROCESS THIS STUFF SO I STARTED LOOKING AT THE BINARY INFORMATION AND I ASKED
I WAS EXHAUSTED AFTER 30 HOURS IN THE LAB I PROBABLY SMELLED HORRIBLE BUT INSTEAD OF JUST GOING HOME AND CALLING IT QUITS I TOOK A STEP BACK
IS UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT CODE CONTROLS YOUR BATTERY
OF BULLETS AND A CAR CHASE BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE ANYMORE WE'RE ENTERING AN AGE WHERE WE CAN STOP HIM WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON FROM 1000 MILES AWAY BECAUSE WHETHER HE KNEW IT OR
OF WARFARE
WARFARE
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD THING
ON THE ONE HAND
IT MEANS WE HAVE WHOLE NEW FRONT ON WHICH WE NEED TO DEFEND OURSELVES
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT MEANS WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW WAY TO ATTACK
A WHOLE NEW WAY TO STOP EVIL PEOPLE FROM DOING EVIL THINGS
SO LET'S CONSIDER AN EXAMPLE OF THIS THAT'S COMPLETELY THEORETICAL
SUPPOSE A TERRORIST WANTS TO BLOW UP A BUILDING AND
IS A LOT OF ONES AND ZEROS IT'S WHAT WE CALL BINARY INFORMATION THIS IS HOW COMPUTERS
COMPUTERS THINK ONES AND ZEROS IT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE THINK BUT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ADAPT OUR MINDS TO THINK MORE LIKE COMPUTERS SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THIS INFORMATION INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE OUR MINDS FIT THE PROBLEM WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING THE PROBLEM
THE REASON FOR THAT IS CYBER IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN ANY ONE OF THOSE THINGS CYBER IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ALL OF OUR LIVES BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF ALL OF OUR LIVES EVEN IF YOU DON'T OWN A COMPUTER COMPUTERS CONTROL EVERYTHING IN YOUR
SO I LOOKED AT IT AT THIS LEVEL THINKING I WAS LOOKING AT THE RIGHT THING ONLY TO SEE THIS DOESN'T HAVE THE CONNECTIVITY I WOULD HAVE
THAT SYSTEM SO I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THE CODE THAT CONTROLS THE BATTERY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT YOU HAVE CODE THAT CONTROLS YOUR SCREEN THAT CONTROLS YOUR BUTTONS
OUT IF THIS WOULD REALLY WORK IN THE WORK I DO EVERY DAY
DISABLE THE OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTIONS ON HIS BATTERY DRASTICALLY OVERLOAD THE CIRCUIT CAUSE THE BATTERY TO OVERHEAT AND
NOT HOW I WANTED TO SPEND MY LIFE BUT AFTER 30 MINUTES OF WORK AS DEFENSE
OF IT REALLY IS THE ESSENCE OF VISUAL EFFECTS SO DIGGING DEEPER INTO THIS WITH THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL OF THE ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURE ARTS AND SCIENCES REVEALS SOME TRUTH BEHIND THE TRICKERY
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO REALIZE THAT FILMS HAD THE POWER TO CAPTURE DREAMS {NS}
GEORGES M LI S WAS FIRST A MAGICIAN NOW
ARE SOME STEPS AND A FEW REPEATS IN THE EVOLUTION OF VISUAL EFFECTS I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY
AS SCALE NOW A FOURTH FACTOR REALLY BECOMES AN OBSESSION WHICH IS NEVER BETRAY THE ILLUSION AND
VERY ESSENTIAL THINGS I WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH YOU TODAY BECAUSE THOSE ESSENTIAL THINGS ARE WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS SHORT CLIP OF FOOTAGE I SEE CERTAIN QUALITIES OF BEING THAT I MUST ADMIT ARE FAR
TO BE MORE PRESENT WITH WHERE WE LIVE AND HOW WE LIVE IN THOSE PLACES WHETHER IT'S TAKING DERELICT PLOTS OF PUBLIC LAND AND ASKING WHAT ELSE COULD THIS BE TO CONTRIBUTE TO A HEALTHY SOCIETY BESIDES A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE THROW TRASH
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO I AM REMINDED OF THE TENDERNESS AND THE DELICACY THAT IS AT RISK IF WE DON'T IMMEDIATELY EMBRACE A MORE MINDFUL WAY OF BEING
BEING WITH OURSELVES AND BEING WITH EACH OTHER
AND IT IS THIS IDEA OF BEING THAT I WANT TO EXPLORE WITH YOU IN OUR FEW SHORT MINUTES TOGETHER
BECAUSE IT IS MY DEEP CONVICTION THAT THIS SIMPLE YET PROFOUND IDEA OF BEING NESS
IS REALLY WHAT WE MUST MOVE TOWARDS AND WHAT WE MUST PRACTICE IF WE ARE TO CREATE THE KIND OF COMPASSIONATE
AND JUST SOCIETY THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT
THAT WE DESERVE AND WE ARE TOTALLY CAPABLE OF
NOW SOMEONE MIGHT SAY SHE'S SLEEPING OF COURSE SHE'S LIKE THAT
BUT ANYONE WHO'S EVER RAISED CHILD PLAYED WITH A CHILD NURTURED A CHILD OR TAUGHT A CHILD
KNOWS THAT THIS IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT WE COME IN LIKE THIS REGARDLESS OF RACE OR GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS WE COME IN WITH THIS CAPABILITY OF BEING PRESENT WITH OURSELVES AT ALL TIMES
ABSENT IN MY DAY TO DAY MEANDERINGS ABOUT PERHAPS YOU WILL FEEL THE SAME
THEN NOTICE THE FEELING OF YOUR FEET IN YOUR SHOES
AND LET THEM REALLY REST ON THE GROUND
NICE
NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND REALLY DO THAT I CAN SEE
YOU
NOTICE ALL THE SMALL SOUNDS
AND A MORE HONEST FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR THE PLANET
KNOW FOR MYSELF WHEN I AM ENCLOSED TO HER HABITS OF BEING EXPRESSED HERE
I FEEL MY OWN JOY I FEEL MY OWN CONNECTION TO THE WORLD I FEEL MY OWN EMBODIMENT AND IN THAT SPACE I SENSE MY CREATIVITY MY AUTHENTICITY AND MY OWN AGENCY AND THAT IS WHERE I SENSE MY OWN EXTRAORDINARY QUALITIES I AM GOING TO IMAGINE THAT IS THE SAME FOR EACH OF YOU
WHAT I ALSO KNOW IS I'VE DEVELOPED THIS SORT OF DETRITUS OF BAD HABITS ALONG THE WAY
I FIND THAT I NEED TO PRACTICE MY BETTER HABITS THAT LITTLE SCORE THAT I DID WITH YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR TIME TOGETHER WAS A SCORE THAT I DO WITH MYSELF TWO FIVE ON MY BAD DAYS 20 TIMES A DAY WHEN I FIND MYSELF SEDUCED INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH MY DAUGHTER OVER WHAT SHE'S GOING TO WEAR TO SCHOOL OR MY DOG LICKS MY LEG FOR THE 20TH TIME OR I'M IN A TRAFFIC JAM AND I'M LATE FOR SOMETHING OR I'VE HAD A REALLY BUMMER COLLABORATIVE MEETING
OR I'VE HEARD NEWS ON THE RADIO THAT IS FULLY DISHEARTENING
FOR ME BUT WOULD NEED TO INSPIRE AND PROPOSE A MORE HEALTHY AND A MORE
PROBABLY WHAT MADE IT WORSE FROM MY PERSONAL STANDPOINT IS THAT THEY WERE JUSTIFIED IN
THEY WOULD SHOOT AT SOMEBODY OTHER THAN ME AS IT TURNED OUT WHILE I WAS TRYING TO MAKE THIS DECISION WE GOT
THE NEW ORDER WOULD BE SO EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT DISTINCTIVE SKILL SET THEN AN EXTRAORDINARY
OTHERS MAY FOLLOW
PEOPLE LIVING IN A COUNTRY HAVE TO ENGAGE NOW IN THE SERIOUS PROCESS OF RESHAPING A NEW POLITICAL ORDER THAT WILL BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT TO WHAT CAME BEFORE THAT WILL BE FUNCTIONAL AND THAT WILL BE SUSTAINED
NOW HOW DO YOU DO THAT
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS
BUT THE WAY THAT HAS BECOME MOST COMMON IN OUR ERA AND THIS
HAPPENED BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BOMBED THE HELL OUT OF IRAQ SENT ITS TROOPS AND FORCED THE OLD REGIME TO LEAVE IN EACH CASE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MODEL OF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE EXISTING ORDER THE
TOOK PLACE WAS NOT THE MECHANISM OF LITERAL OVERTHROW IT WAS CONVINCING THE MILITARY THAT IT WAS LT BR GT NOT A GOOD IDEA
THAT A REVOLUTION CAN ULTIMATELY SUCCEED IS IF THE BORING PRACTICAL INSTITUTIONAL WORK OF SHAPING NEW INSTITUTIONS CAN HAPPEN AND ULTIMATELY THE PUBLIC IN A GIVEN COUNTRY HAS TO BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM THEY HAVE IS
MOMENT THAT SOMEONE STARTED SHOOTING AT US
THE KIDS RAN AWAY EXTREMELY QUICKLY
AND THEY ALSO SEEMED TO KNOW WHERE THE BULLETS WERE COMING FROM WHICH PUT THEM ONE UP ON ME
AND I FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO WORK OUT WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE SEEN
BY WHOEVER WERE SHOOTING AT US AS THOUGH I HAD A WEAPON
SO THAT MAYBE THEY WOULD GO AWAY
NOW LET ME SAY SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SKILL SET THAT IS NECESSARY FOR STAGE ONE OF THE REVOLUTION AND STAGE TWO OF THE REVOLUTION LET ME SAY THAT USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE ARAB SPRING
BY THE WAY PARENTHETICALLY IT IS OBVIOUS IN THE US CASE
WHY THE US COULDN'T DO STAGE TWO IN IRAQ
NOBODY CAN ARRANGE NEW POLITICAL ORDER FROM THE OUTSIDE OF A SOCIETY
I MEAN YOU CAN FORCE IT ON PEOPLE BUT THEY HAVE TO ADOPT IT THEMSELVES OVER TIME
FORCING IT WOULD BE THE EXAMPLES OF UNITED STATES AND GERMANY AFTER WW2 OR JAPAN AFTER WW2 SO IF PEOPLE SAY YOU CAN NEVER SUCCESSFULLY IMPOSE A CONSTITUTION THAT'S NOT LITERALLY TRUE UNITED STATES DID SO IN BOTH JAPAN AND IN GERMANY
BUT FOR THAT TO BECOME
AN ACTUALLY EXISTING
PEOPLE
WENT INTO THE STREETS
IN THE ARAB SPRING COUNTRIES
CONVINCED THE PUBLIC
THAT CHANGE WAS POSSIBLE
AND COORDINATED AMONGST THEMSELVES
THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS OF PEOPLE LT BR GT WHO WERE EXTREMELY BRAVE AND WENT INTO THE STREETS KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THEY WILL GET TEAR GASSED SHOT AT LT BR GT AND VERY WELL POSSIBLY KILLED
SO THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO UNLIKE ME WHO GOT SHOT AT BY ACCIDENT WERE ACTUALLY BRAVE PEOPLE WHO WERE CHOOSING TO GO INTO THE STREETS KNOWING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GET SHOT AT
NOW TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE CHARISMA
YOU HAVE TO HAVE ORGANIZATION AND ABOVE ALL ELSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE IMAGINATION
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IMAGINE THAT THE WORLD CAN BE DIFFERENT
AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE ENORMOUS RISK FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY
BR GT A REVOLUTIONARY VANGUARD AND WHAT DOES THE REVOLUTIONARY VANGUARD DO TO GIVE ITSELF A CHANCE TO CREATE A NEW WORLD IT STARTS ORDERING PEOPLE AROUND IT
ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY WAYS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE LT BR GT AND ESPECIALLY CONNECTED EDUCATED AND IN SOME SENSE ELITE
FOR THE SOCIETY IT HAS TO BE ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE
LT BR GT I MEAN THE GAME IS NOT OVER THERE IT'S NOT A GAME IT'S A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION THE PROCESS IS NOT OVER THERE BUT IT CAN WORK IT CAN BE POSSIBLE TO REPRESS PEOPLE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO KILL ENOUGH OF THEM IN TUNISIA AND THEN AGAIN IN EGYPT THE MILITARIES
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MAYBE MILLIONS WANTED US OUT RIGHT AWAY THE REASON THAT THEY BEGAN TO WANT US
DEMOCRATS PEOPLE WHO ARE FOCUSED ON RELIGION AND DEMOCRACY HAVE WON AND IT IS EXACTLY WHAT
IT REQUIRES THE BUILDING LT BR GT OF LASTING AND ENDURING INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE TO ACTUALLY WORK
AND IT IS ABOVE ALL ELSE BORING
IT'S NOT CHARISMATIC
SURE YOU CAN BE CHARISMATIC IN THIS PROCESS
BUT THAT'S NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM LT BR GT A GUIDE TO WINNING IT'S GOOD TO HAVE GOOD IDEAS
BUT ONE STRIKING FEATURE OF THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS AS THEY EXIST IN TUNISIA AND EGYPT IS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE
CHARISMATIC REMARKABLE LT BR GT IMPRESSIVE PEOPLE AT THE TOP
THEY HAVE IDEAS THAT CARRY CHARISMA
AND THEY HAVE ABOVE ALL ELSE THE IDEA OF ISLAM WHICH IS A TREMENDOUSLY RICH POWERFUL LT BR GT AND CHARISMATIC IDEA BUT THEY ARE NOT DEPENDENT LT BR GT ON CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP
THEY'RE ALSO BY THE WAY AT LEAST SO FAR NOT VERY TECHNOLOGICALLY WIRED
THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE SEEN BEING SO EFFECTIVE AT STAGE ONE
ORGANIZING PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING RAPIDLY HAVE NOT AS OF YET BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN STAGE TWO THAT'S ITSELF A TOPIC FOR ANOTHER TALK
SO IF I COULD LEAVE YOU WITH CENTRAL MESSAGE HERE LT BR GT ABOUT THE NATURE OF REVOLUTIONS
IT'S THAT
REVOLUTIONARY EFFORTS THAT CLEAR THE TABLE BUT DON'T CREATE SOMETHING NEW
ULTIMATELY FAIL
THAT THE ONLY WAY
NOW
IN THIS SITUATION WE WERE AN OCCUPYING FORCE
AND THEY WERE JUSTIFIED IN SOME SENSE WHOEVER THEY WERE IN SHOOTING AT US I WAS WITH UNIFORM PERSONNEL I
DON'T MEAN IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR THEM TO DO AND FORTUNATELLY NOBODY WAS HURT IN THAT INCIDENT
BUT THEIR INSTINCT WAS NOT AN UNREASONABLE ONE THIS WAS AN OCCUPYING ARMY IN THEIR COUNTRY AND SOMEBODY AND IT TURNED OUT MANY MANY
EFFECTIVE AND CAPABLE OF WORKING THANK YOU VERY MUCH {NS}
UNPRECEDENTED LT BR GT IN THE HISTORY OF REVOLUTIONS NOW WHAT HAPPENS USUALLY BETWEEN STAGE ONE LT BR GT AND STAGE TWO OF A REVOLUTION WELL THE PEOPLE WHO MADE STAGE ONE WOULD LIKE TO
AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH
ADMINISTRATORS AND YES RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES TOO
NOT PERHAPS HOLDING FORMAL JOBS
BUT OFFERING SOME SORT OF A MORAL BULLWORK AGAINST WHICH
SOCIETAL AFFAIRS CAN PROGRESS
NOW IT IS MUCH TOO SOON
TO SAY THEY WILL SUCCEED
BUT WHAT IS REMARKABLE IS LT BR GT THAT THE SKILL SET THAT THEY HAVE IS SO STRIKINGLY DISPARATE AND DIFFERENT DIVERGENT FROM THE SKILL SET POSSESSED LT BR GT BY THE STAGE ONE REVOLUTIONARIES
THEY ARE GOOD AT GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION
DRAWING PEOPLE INTO ORDINARY POLITICAL PRACTICES
CONVINCING THEM THAT THEY HAVE THE VALUES AND IDEALS
THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE ANYBODY EVER SHOT AT ME AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE PLEASURE LET ME LET
IDEA ON THEIR PART OR A BAD IDEA ON THEIR PART BUT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THAT FOR YOURSELVES
WHAT THIS REVOLUTIONARY GROUP DID IS THEY PUT THEMSELVES UP LT BR GT FOR ELECTION ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEY CREATED NATIONAL ELECTIONS
AND IMMEDIATELY LT BR GT THEY WERE ALMOST ALL SWEPT OUT OF OFFICE
YOU CAN IMAGINE A SORT OF CLASSIC COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY VANGUARD THEY COULDN'T CONTAIN THEIR LAUGHTER LT BR GT AT THE SITUATION YOU MADE A REVOLUTION LT BR GT AND NOW YOU PUT YOURSELF UP FOR ELECTION AND YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY VOTED OUT OF OFFICE AND WHAT'S MORE THEY PROBABLY KNEW ON SOME LEVEL THEY'D BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE
BECAUSE IN EVERY SINGLE ARABIC
DICTATORSHIP IS RESOLVED BY THE EXISTENCE OF INSTITUTIONS LT BR GT THAT BALANCE EACH OTHER THAT IS TO SAY LEGISLATURE A
WITH POWER AND THE PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER
THAT'S WHY IT COULDN'T HAPPEN IN IRAQ
AT LEAST NOT IN THE TIME FRAME LT BR GT THAT UNITED STATES WAS THERE
IN THE ARAB SPRING CASES LT BR GT THE SITUATION IS ALL TOGETHER DIFFERENT
SO LET'S START WITH THE SKILL SET TO CHANGE THE ORDER THIS IS PEACEFUL REVOLUTION NOT VIOLENT REVOLUTION LT BR GT IMPOSED FROM THE OUTSIDE
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR LT BR GT FROM SOME OF THE NEXT SPEAKERS IN THIS
THERE'S NOTHING INHERENTLY WESTERN ABOUT DEMOCRACY
INDIA WHEN I LAST CHECKED IS NOT A WESTERN COUNTRY AND IT IS THE LARGEST AND AMONG THE BETTER FUNCTIONING DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD
SO DEMOCRACY CAN ADAPT ADJUST AND BE MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE LT BR GT AND CAN BE MADE TO BE RECONCILED WITH DIFFERENT WORLD VIEWS
BUT IT WILL
THERE OR THE ISLAMIC DEMOCRATS IN EGYPT WHO HOPED TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GOVERN WHERE IT REMAINS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MILITARY CAN ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY SHAPE LT BR GT IN THE STAGE TWO
SAID TO THEM WELL AMBASSADOR BREMER IS THE GOVERNMENT HE HAD ARRIVED A DAY OR TWO BEFORE AND THEN THEY SAID WHO THE HELL IS AMBASSADOR BREMER I SAID WELL YOU KNOW HE WAS SENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEY SAID WELL THAT'S OKAY AS LONG AS SOMEBODY IS THE
LIES OVERWHELMINGLY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WENT INTO THE STREETS LT BR GT BUT NOTICE THAT THE MECHANISM WHEREBY THE
THE ARAB WORLD
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THESE YOUNG LEADERS INSPIRED LOTS MORE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE SOCIETY SO THAT EVENTUALLY THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS WERE NOT JUST THE EDUCATOR OR THE YOUNG OR PEOPLE WITH THE ACCESS TO A TWITTER ACCOUNT
BUT BROAD CROSS SECTIONS OF THE SOCIETY LT BR GT IN THESE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SO IN TUNISIA YOU SAW LABOR UNIONS AND IN EGYPT YOU SAW LT BR GT AN ENORMOUS CROSS SECTION OF SOCIETY
THAT WAS STAGE ONE
AS IT TURNED OUT LT BR GT EVEN THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH FULLY TO DISPLACE THE GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS AS WE SEE IN SYRIA TODAY TURNED TO THEIR
SOCIETY OVER TIME
AND DOING ALL THIS IN REAL TIME
THIS IS NOT EVERYONE GET TOGETHER LET'S HAVE PROTEST
THIS IS LET'S REORGANIZE OUR SOCIETY LT BR GT AND DRAFT A NEW CONSTITUTION THAT WILL ENABLE US TO GOVERN ACCORDING TO NEW PRINCIPLES
THIS IS ITERATIVE REPEATED OVER MONTHS NOT DAYS
THIS IS IDEOLOGICAL IT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO HAVE BELIEFS ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY TO BE GOVERNED
IT IS
THEY STILL THERE THEY REPRESENT MINORITY PARTIES
OR SOME OF THEM ARE IN COALITION WITH ISLAMIC PARTIES AS ONE SEES FOR EXAMPLE IN TUNISIA BUT FOR
THE MOST PART LT BR GT AND I THINK I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT AND IF YOU ONLY TAKE AWAY ONE THING FROM LT BR GT WHAT I'VE SAID THEN I HOPE IS THIS BY PUTTING THEMSELVES UP FOR ELECTION THE STAGE TWO REVOLUTIONARIES
LT BR GT ABOLISHED THEIR OWN POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND THAT IS EITHER THE MOST ADMIRABLE THING LT BR GT I'VE EVER HEARD OF IN THE HISTORY OF REVOLUTIONS OR THE CRAZIEST
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS NOW IN STAGE TWO
IN STAGE TWO THE PEOPLE LT BR GT WHO'RE GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE A NEW FUNCTIONING ORDER ARE MOSTLY PEOPLE WHO ARE THEMSELVES ENGAGED LT BR GT IN A UNIQUE HISTORICAL UNDERTAKING
OF TRYING TO RECONCILE ISLAMIC VALUES DRAWN IN PART FROM SHARIA THE CLASSICAL ISLAMIC LAW WITH WESTERN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THEY WILL NO LONGER BE WESTERN AS THEY ARE ORIENTED TO AND MADE TO
THAT USUALLY ON THE GROUNDS THAT
WE ARE IN A EXTRAORDINARY NEW SITUATION THINGS ARE CHANGING VERY FAST
WE ARE GOING TO BE IN CHARGE HERE YOU CAN
SEE THIS IN THE CASE OF LT BR GT THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY INCIDENTALLY WHICH TALKS THIS WAY
THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE REVOLUTION
BUT THEY STILL SAY THAT THINGS ARE UNSTABLE AND UNCERTAIN YOU REALLY NEED US
IN ANY CASE MOST REVOLUTIONS ENTAIL THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MADE STAGE ONE TRYING TO MAKE STAGE TWO HAPPEN
THIS REVOLUTIONARY SITUATION WAS EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO DID STAGE ONE LT BR GT
THE WILL OF THE PRESIDENTS AND THE VERY NEXT DAY IN EACH CASE THE PRESIDENTS MUBARAK IN EGYPT LT BR GT AND BEN ALI IN TUNISIA FLED SO CREDIT FOR WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED THERE
THAT'S THE FIRST CRUCIAL STAGE IN IRAQ WHICH IN THE END ULTIMATELY I WILL SUGGEST YOU PROBABLY WAS NOT A REVOLUTION THE CHANGE IN EXISTING ORDER ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN
AT ME WHICH IS A VERY AWKWARD SITUATION TO BE IN AND I WASN'T EVEN FEELING I WAS IN A RIOT NOR DID I HAVE ANY WEAPON OF ANY KIND ON ME SO LET ME JUST
PROBLEMS IN THEIR SOCIETIES THAT SOLVES THE POLITICAL BALANCE QUESTION IN
VERY KIND OF STAID AND FORMAL AND MEANWHILE I USE
MODELED ON THE TITANIC BUT IT'S NOT A CRI DE COEUR ABOUT MAN'S HUBRIS IN THE FACE OF THE ELEMENTS IT'S JUST A SICK SILLY JOKE
A CANARY HUNG INSIDE THE THING TO MAKE
THINKING ABOUT IT AND THEN WHEN IT RAN A LOVELY LADY AN OLD LADY NAMED MRS EDGAR ROSENBERG IF YOU KNOW THAT NAME CALLED ME AND SAID SHE LOVED THE COVER IT WAS SO SWEET HER FORMER NAME WAS FAY WRAY AND SO THAT
ALWAYS ASK ME WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR IDEAS HOW DO YOUR IDEAS COME TRUTH ABOUT THAT ONE IS I HAD A HORRIBLE RED WINE HANGOVER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THIS CAME TO ME LIKE XEROX ALL I HAD TO DO WAS WRITE IT DOWN IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR I DIDN'T
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I HAD AN ART SHOW IN NEW YORK AND I TITLED IT SERIOUS NONSENSE SO I THINK I'M ACTUALLY THE FIRST ONE HERE I LEAD
SAID THAT NOSTALGIA IS THE ONE UTTERLY MOST USELESS HUMAN EMOTION SO I THINK THAT S A CASE FOR SERIOUS PLAY
THAT EVER WAS AND IT S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN FINE BOOKSTORES CRUMMY BOOKSTORES TABLES ON THE STREET IN OCTOBER SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ALWAYS WRONG ALWAYS HILARIOUSLY OPTIMISTICALLY WRONG AND THE PEAK TIME FOR THAT WAS THE 30S BECAUSE THE DEPRESSION WAS SO DISMAL THAT ANYTHING TO GET AWAY FROM THE PRESENT INTO THE FUTURE AND TECHNOLOGY WAS GOING TO CARRY US
OF 25 OR 27 OR 30 DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK WHEN I USUALLY SHARE THIS WORD WITH SOMEONE WHO IS UNFAMILIAR WITH IT THE REACTION IS A MIX OF SURPRISE AND DISMAY
TELEVISION STATION WHERE I WAS WORKING AT THAT TIME WAS FULL OF LEFTOVERS THEY WERE THE
REALIZED THAT THEY WERE AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POPULATION
I BEGAN TO CHRONICLE THEIR LIVES IN A BOOK
THE MORE I SPOKE WITH LEFTOVER WOMEN THE MORE I'VE REALIZED THEIR LIVES WERE BROADCASTING A MINI DIORAMA OF THE STORY OF CHINA'S RISE AND DEVELOPMENT
A CHART THE CHART YOU ABOUT TO SEE IS MY FAVORITE CHART
WHERE DO THEY COME FROM WHY DO THERE SUDDENLY SEEM TO BE SO MANY OF THEM THE BEST ANSWER I CAN PROVIDE FOR THAT HAS TO DO WITH
AND EDUCATIONALLY THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY COMPATIBLE WITH LEFTOVER WOMEN WHAT WE SEE IS THAT CHINA RIGHT NOW HAS TWO HUGE POPULATIONS OF LEFTOVERS
WILLING TO STAND UP AND DEFEND IT EVEN IF IT MEANS LIVING IN A WAY THAT IS CONSIDERED UNCONVENTIONAL SUSPECT OR TRAGIC
REPRESENT A CLASS OF WOMEN WHO ARE CARVING OUT A NEW TIMELINE FOR THEIR YOUNG ADULT YEARS A CLASS OF WOMEN WHO PERHAPS CHOOSE TO FLESH THEMSELVES AND THEIR CAREERS OUT A BIT MORE FULLY BEFORE MAKING ANY MAJOR
WERE CLEARLY HOLDING THE KEYS TO GREATER EDUCATION WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE FLIP FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE
WHICH MEANS FOR EVERY 100 GIRLS BORN THERE ARE 105 BOYS THIS IS A LAW OF NATURE IT TENDS TO HAPPEN THIS WAY
AS SOON AS THE FIRST DRAFT OF MY BOOK WAS DONE I FELT THIS DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WRITING A BOOK ABOUT LEFTOVER WOMEN IS A PRIVILEGE YOU GET TO SPEND TIME WITH SOME OF THE FUNNIEST MOST TRAILBLAZING WOMEN IN CHINA
ROLL TO MAKE BETTER SENSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CHART I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A DIFFERENT SET OF DATA AS
IS A HUGE PARADIGM SHATTERING SHIFT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE WAY RELATIONSHIPS ARE FORMED MARRIAGES WORK AND HOW WE LIVE BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS
BY 2020 THE CHINESE ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES ESTIMATES THERE WILL BE 30 MILLION MORE MEN OF MARRIAGE AGE IN CHINA THAN WOMEN
DURING CHINESE NEW YEAR WHEN SHE WENT HOME THE INQUISITION WOULD BEGIN
I AM NOT A MAN AND I AM NOT A WOMAN {LG} THIS IS WHEN THE AUDIENCE LOOKS AT HER IN A FUNNY WAY AND SHE SAYS I'M A FEMALE
INCITE A LOT OF MUCH NEEDED CHANGE IN SOCIETY AND YES THEY DO GO BY MANY NAMES ALL AROUND THE WORLD
THE EDITORS AND THE DIRECTORS A VIBRANT POPULATION OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO I DEEPLY ADMIRED IN MY EYES THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE TOAST OF THE NATION A GLITTERING TESTAMENT
REVISED MONOLOGUE TO TELL YOU A BIT ABOUT HOW SHE ARRIVED WHERE SHE IS TODAY
SHE WAS IN A FRENZY SHE WAS 24 YEARS OLD AND HER DAD DECIDED SHE NEEDED TO GET MARRIED THE PROBLEM IS HE WAS APPROACHING HER MARRIAGE SEARCH LIKE A FOOTBALL
ECONOMICALLY SOCIALLY POLITICALLY IT'S BEEN USED AS MEANS OF SEALING ALLIANCES BROKERING DEALS
ENFORCING IDEOLOGIES
A FORMER PARTY OFFICIAL WHO I INTERVIEWED ABOUT THIS TOLD ME THAT MARRIAGE IN CHINA IS THE WIND CHIME UPON WHICH ALL CHANGES IN THE SOCIOPOLITICAL CLIMATE ARE ANNOUNCED
WE WILL BE PERFORMING AT THE PEARL THEATER TOMORROW AFTERNOON SINCE WE FIRST STARTED THIS PLAY EIGHT MONTHS AGO IN BEIJING MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE LIVES OF OUR PERFORMERS IN FACT ABOUT HALF OF THEM ARE NO LONGER SINGLE
POPULATION OF CHINESE WOMEN KNOWN AS SHENGNV OR LEFTVER WOMEN
TO WRITE THEIR STORIES VERY CANDID VERY VISCERAL VERY PERSONAL INTIMATE STORIES THAT THEY SHARED ON STAGE
EXPECTATIONS OF HOW HIS GIRLFRIEND SHOULD TEND TO DOMESTIC DUTIES HE SHARES HOW IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE LOST THIS GIRL THAT HE TRULY LEARNED TO
CONGRATULATIONS LADIES YOU NOW EARN MORE HIGHER EDUCATION THAN
BE IDEALISTIC BUT DON'T BE A TOTAL DREAMER WE ARE SOCIAL CREATURES SO IT IS DIFFICULT NOT TO BE INFLUENCED BY EXTERNAL PRESSURES BUT ULTIMATELY WE ARE INDIVIDUALS
SUFFICE TO SAY THAT ALL OF THAT STUDYING HAS PAID OFF IN GREAT DIVIDENDS
AND WITH ABANDON
BUT THEN AS SOON AS YOU GRADUATE COLLEGE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WHOLE SET OF STANDARDS ARE IMPOSED ON YOUR MARRIAGE SEARCH
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT SOMEONE'S HU KOU WHETHER THEY OWN A CAR OR A HOME AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SEARCH THIS WAY
BECAUSE CHRISTMAS IS ON THE 25TH OF DECEMBER SO THE IDEA IS AFTER YOUR 25TH BIRTHDAY YOU'RE DONE
REASONABLY MILD GENDER IMBALANCE AS YOU CLICK THROUGH
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN THE ONE CHILD POLICY WHEN COMBINED WITH CHINA'S TRADITIONAL PREFERENCE FOR BOYS HAS LED TO A SURPLUS OF
WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE NAME OF OUR PLAY
DESPITE THE CHANGE IN STATUS OF MANY OF OUR PERFORMERS BECAUSE WE CAME TO REALIZE THAT MORE THAN A LABEL
LEFTOVER IS A MINDSET
IT IS THE TRADEMARK OF ANY PERSON WHO
SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL HER MOM ALWAYS TOLD HER THAT SHE NEEDED TO STUDY HARD BECAUSE HER EYES WERE TOO SMALL AND SHE WOULDN'T ATTRACT A GOOD HUSBAND {LG}
TALL ORDER I HAD A DESIRE TO SHOW A LIVE AUDIENCE WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING AS
{LG} MAYBE I CAN FIND THEM INTRODUCE THEM TO MY LEFTOVER FRIENDS {LG} IT TURNS OUT THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE SO EASY IF
OF ALL I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE WORD LEFTOVER IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH AN UNFAIR AND INACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF A POPULATION OF WOMEN WHO I TRULY BELIEVED SHOWED GREAT PROMISE
YES OMUSASUSI THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THESE WOMEN IN MY TRIBE IN KENYA SHE THEN TOLD ME THAT KENYA HAS 52 DIFFERENT
AND IT WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE AWARE OF ANIMALS AND OTHER HUMANS AND NOT TO BE OVERLOADED WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT GREEN
WELL THIS WAS A NICE TOOL AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR EVOLUTION BUT TODAY IT'S A PROBLEM
TODAY
THIS PLANT BLINDNESS PREVENTS US FOR
MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER BUT THEY CAN MOVE A LOT OPS
WORK AND WE ARE ALL THE TIME UNDERESTIMATING THEIR
STEFANO SO CONSCIOUSNESS IS JUST YOUR ABILITY TO BUILD A MODEL OF YOURSELF IN RELATION TO THE SPACE TO THE OTHER ORGANISMS AND TO THE TIME ARE PLANTS ABLE TO DO THAT
IT'S A KIND OF TOOL THAT PROTECTS OUR BRAIN TO BE OVERLOADED WITH A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS USELESS GREEN STUFF
AND THE SECOND THE SECOND POINT IS THAT PLANTS HAVE NO ORGANS
THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLE DIFFERENCE WITH THE ANIMALS
SO I MEAN ANIMALS CONCENTRATE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS INSIDE SPECIFIC ORGANS SO WE HAVE EYES TO SEE WE HAVE LUNGS FOR BREATHING WE HAVE THE STOMACH TO DIGEST AND SO ON
BUT THE PLANTS EVOLVED NOT TO HAVE ANY ORGANS BECAUSE HAVING AN ORGAN IS TOO DANGEROUS
FOR PLANTS THAT HAVE
TO BE PREDATED TO BE EATED BY ANIMALS SO YOU CAN IMAGINE
THAT A SINGLE INSECT JUST EATING A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR BRAIN WOULD BE ENOUGH TO KILL YOU
IS MADE THAT IS AMAZING THAT MAKES POSSIBLE THIS WONDERFUL MOVEMENT
AH SO THIS IS WHY THE PLANTS HAVE NO ORGANS BUT
HAVING NO ORGANS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY HAVE NOT THE FUNCTION
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT
IN OTHER WORDS PLANTS ARE ABLE TO SEE WITHOUT EYES THEY ARE ABLE TO HEAR WITHOUT
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER
CAN WE TELL THAT PLANTS ARE CONSCIOUS ORGANISMS
SO BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THEY ARE INTELLIGENT I WILL NOT DISCUSS WITH YOU ABOUT THAT
PLANTS ARE INTELLIGENT AND
THEY ARE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND THIS IS MY PREFERRED DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE
NOW THE POINT IS ARE PLANTS CONSCIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS IS
ARE PLANTS AWARE
OF THEIR POSITION IN THE ENVIRONMENT SO
IT'S PROBLEM TO FIND RIGHT DEFINITIONS ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS IT'S NORMALLY DEFINED BY
REMOVING
A GREEN LIFE ALL THE ANIMALS ALTOGETHER HUMAN INCLUDED IS JUST 0 3
JUST IN REAL TIME SO IT'S FEW TIMES FEW SECONDS A GROWING ROOT IS PRODUCING SPECIFIC SOUNDS THAT PROBABLY ARE
SO EVERYTHING THAT I WOULD SAY THAT THE LIFE OF THE PLANET IT'S A
A LAST THING FROM MY POINT OF VIEW INTELLIGENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE
REAL BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENONS
SO THEY CAN BE STUDIED AS REAL THEY NEED TO BE STUDIED AS REAL BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENONS
AND IT'S SOMETHING LIKE REPRODUCTION I MEAN REPRODUCTION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN BACTERIA PHANGIAE AND HUMANS OK BUT THERE IS A COMMON
BACKGROUND THAT MEANS THAT THE PHENOMENON IS REPRODUCTION IT'S THE SAME FOR INTELLIGENCE IT'S DIFFERENT BUT ALWAYS THE SAME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THINGS ABOUT PLANTS PLANTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE ABLE TO MEMORIZE THEY ARE ABLE TO MEMORIZE AND TO LEARN
WE DEMONSTRATED JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO TEACH A MIMOSA SENSITIVE PLANT NOT TO CLOSE ANYMORE WHEN THERE IS A NON DANGEROUS STIMULUS
AND THIS SENSITIVE PLANT IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE INFORMATION FOR 40 DAYS SO I MEAN THE MEMORY LASTS AT LEAST 40 DAYS THAT IS A LOT
AND IN THE AVERAGE THE MEMORY OF AN INSECT IS JUST 24 HOURS
EVEN FOR ME 40 DAYS IS A LOT
AND SO IT'S AMAZING TO SEE THAT PLANTS ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN INFORMATION FOR SO LONG
AND
AND PHYSICAL PARAMETERS ALL THE TIME AMONG THEM THERE ARE ALL THE OUR COMMON SENSE LET'S SAY BUT ALSO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT STRANGE AS ELECTRICAL GRADIENT CHEMICAL
WE KNOW THAT
TODAY THAT
PLANTS HAVE DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF RELATIVENESS
OF THE OTHER PLANTS SO NORMALLY FOR EXAMPLE BEANS THE VERY COMMON BEAN
ARE COOPERATING WHEN THEY ARE IN THE SAME POT THEY ARE RELATED
BUT WHEN THE TWO PLANTS ARE UNRELATED THEY ARE NORMALLY COMPETING
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE
I'M SORRY I CANNOT SPEAK IN YOUR WONDERFUL LANGUAGE
BUT IT'S ALL THE SAME A PLEASURE TO BE HERE IN THIS WONDERFUL PLACE THE
RIGHT PLACE TO
SPEAK ABOUT PLANTS
OK LET'S START IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT TOO MUCH TIME AND I WILL SHOW YOU NOW
FOUR SLIDES IN A VERY FAST
THEY ARE ABLE TO TASTE AND TO SMELL AND TO BREATH WITHOUT THE ORGANS AND THEY ARE ALSO ABLE TO MAKE CALCULATIONS MEMORIZE LEARN WITHOUT BRAIN
SO REPTILES ARE VERY WELL
BECAUSE THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE PLANTS IS VERY WELL KNOWN PLANTS ARE SOCIAL
AN ADULT MAN AND A
YOUNG GIRL WELL ALL THESE SLIDES HAVE IN COMMON THE FACT THAT 80
OF THE SLIDES IS MADE BY PLANTS
BUT OUR BRAIN IS FILTERING OUT
INFORMATION ABOUT THE POSITION OF THE ROOTS IN THE SOIL
UNBELIEVABLE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY HOW
FOR THE LAST SLIDE 98 OF THE PEOPLE
DID HEAVEN HEATHER ITSELF AT YOUR WRIST CAT CRADLING HOPE BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS HAVE YOU EVER BATHED IN THE HUSH OF ANOTHER MAN'S PRAYERS WHILE SOAKING OFF ALL UNREASONABLE DOUBT
INTIMACY OUR MINDS JUST JUMP INTO BED
IT IS REGENERATIVE WE EXPERIENCE BOTH THE REWARDS AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF
SOMEONE WHO REENFORCES OUR IMMEDIATE COMPLETENESS
WELCOME AND THAT SOMEONE ELSE DOWN THE ROAD JUST MIGHT HAVE THE COURAGE TO OPEN THEIR ARMS AND CATCH US THANK YOU
AND THEN AGAIN YOU MIGHT NOT BE BUT ISN'T IT STRANGE HOW WHEN WE HEAR THE
HEART AND AN OPEN MIND AND AN OPEN SPIRIT WHEN WE'RE WELCOMED WHEN WE'RE LOVED OPENLY EASILY OUR TRUST GROWS OFF OF THAT
AND THEN I REMEMBERED THIS
A
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
I WENT THROUGH ONE OF THE HARDEST BREAKUPS OF MY LIFE
THUS FAR
I LITERALLY REMEMBER WATCHING THIS MAN
WALK OUT OF MY LIFE
US TO PRACTICE AN UNDRESSING OF PRETENCE
CALLUSES ON OUR SPIRITS AND AVOID FEELING THE NEED TO NEED ANYONE OTHER THAN OURSELVES THIS DEFENSE MECHANISM THAT WE HAVE CREATES A
FRIENDS AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT WHEREVER AND WHENEVER I AM WITH HIM I FEEL LIKE I'M HOME
KIND OF DIVINITY TO IT WHEN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE SANCTUARY THAT WE HAVE IN SOMEONE ELSE AND VICE VERSA EGO BECOMES EVAPORATED AND WE GIVE UP A PORTION OF OUR RIGHTS TO BE IN CONTROL
HAVE YOU BEEN INTIMATE YOU USUALLY GIVE THEM A YES OR A NO OR I DON'T KISS AND
SOME LIGHT SOME CATCHING SOME UNFOLDING SOME
EFFECT WITHIN OUR SOCIETY WHERE WE SAY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HURT NO ONE ELSE FROM THIS POINT ON DESERVES TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ME
I REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS MY TURN I CLOSED MY EYES CROSSED MY ARMS OVER MY CHEST AND STARTED TO ROCK BACK ON MY HEELS
THING IS THAT WE GET BACK UP REALIZING THAT FALLING OVER AND
DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT TOO
UNTIL I MET THIS GUY THROUGH A MUTUAL FRIEND WE
HADN'T KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR VERY LONG BUT ONE DAY WE WERE TALKING
AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE CONVERSATION HE ASKED ME JUST PLAIN AS DAY
SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
I CHALLENGE YOU EVEN WHEN IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN IT IS HARD TO REMAIN HUMAN TO FEEL AND TO DO IT DEEPLY AND OPENLY
BEAUTIFUL IS IT TO HAVE SOMEONE NOT NECESSARY A ROMANTIC PARTNER OR A LOVER BUT JUST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THAT WE CAN ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE BROKEN IN FRONT OF
SOME SWEET FALLING IT'S BEEN A WHILE HASN'T IT
WHEN ENIGMA WAS BORN HE WAS THREE METERS LONG IN A METRIC TON YOU KNOW AVERAGE FOR
A SPERM WHALE BUT
IN ABOUT 25 YEARS TIME
WHEN ENIGMA IS FULLY GROWN HE'LL BE AS LONG AS TWO SCHOOL BUSES
AND WEIGH AS MUCH AS TEN OF THEM
THE MALE SPERM WHALE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ANIMALS ON THE PLANET
HE WILL BECOME MOBY DICK
AND WHEN HIS MOM MYSTERIO MAKES DEEP DIVES
IS MATRILINEAL IT'S GRANDMOTHERS MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS WHO LIVE TOGETHER FOR LIFE
CARING FOR EACH OTHER AND DEFENDING THEIR FAMILY
FAMILY
IS CRITICAL
TO SURVIVAL
IN THE VAST DARKNESS OF THE OPEN OCEAN ALL THAT THEY HAVE IS EACH OTHER
PINCHY
FIND SUCH DEEP SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE LIFE OF A SPERM WHALE
THAT LIVES SO NEAR THE ISLANDS SO NEAR TO US
IS AT RISK
THERE'S LESS THAN 300 ANIMALS LEFT IN THE CARIBBEAN CLAN
AND 1 IN 3 BABIES BORN OFF DOMINICA WILL NOT MAKE IT TO THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY
APRIL
BEFORE LEARNING TO MAKE THESE CALLS ACCURATELY
AND THEY NEED TO MAKE IT RIGHT
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL CLAN
WHERE THEY BELONG RECOGNIZABLE ACROSS THESE HUGE GEOGRAPHIC SCALES THAT THESE ANIMALS EXIST ACROSS
WHEN TWO FAMILIES OF SPERM WHALES MEET AT SEA THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT FAMILIES THAT SPEAK THE SAME DIALECT
FAMILIES FROM THE SAME CLAN WILL SPEND TIME TOGETHER AND FAMILIES THAT SPEAK A DIFFERENT DIALECT FROM DIFFERENT CLANS WILL
BIRTH OF A NEW SPERM WHALE CALF IT GIVES ME HOPE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
SO I'M HERE NOT TO LET US REMAIN IMMUNE TO THE SUFFERING THAT THESE WHALES ARE GOING THROUGH TO NOT ALLOW US TO BE IGNORANT OF THE DAMAGE THAT WE CAUSED TO PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT WE DON'T OFTEN SEE
BUT I'M ALSO HERE TO CELEBRATE THEM
THE BEAUTY AND MAGNIFICENCE OF A SPERM WHALE
HOW AMAZING THEIR LIVES ARE
GLOBALLY SPERM WHALES REMOVE AS MUCH BIOMASS FROM THE OCEAN AS ALL OF HUMANITY'S FISHERIES COMBINED BUT ENIGMA IS STILL
PINCHY
FINGERS AND
HER AND IN 2015
DIGIT GOT A ROPE TIED AROUND HER TAIL
SHE WAS ONLY FOUR
SHE DOESN'T DIVE DEEPLY ANYMORE
AND SHE'S STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE
FINGERS HAS HAD TO START NURSING HER AGAIN
EVERY CALF COUNTS
ESPECIALLY WHEN FAMILIES ARE SO SMALL
IF THESE FAMILIES ARE GOING TO PERPETUATE THEMSELVES THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CALF SURVIVES
AND THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING
EVERY YEAR WHEN I LEAVE I WONDER WHICH ONE OF
HARD NOT TO THINK ABOUT HOW CHRONIC INJURY LIKE THIS WOULD AFFECT THE WHOLE DYNAMIC OF MY FAMILY
THIS ROPE CREATES SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF DRAG AND THAT DRAG IS GOING TO EXHAUST HER AND
AS SHE GROWS THE ROPE THAT'S TIED AROUND HER TAIL WILL CINCH IT OFF
IT'S HARD ON A NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT THAT'S SO EXCITING
IT'S EASY REALLY TO FORGET THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE
PINCHY WAS HIT IN 2010 BUT SHE'S A LUCKY ONE
CALVES I WON'T SEE AGAIN EVERY YEAR WHEN I COME HOME FROM THE OCEAN I WONDER WHICH WHALE I KNOW SO WELL WILL BE GONE LOSING
FOR OUR OWN IDENTITIES
WHAT IS LOST
WHEN WE LOSE A WAY OF LIFE
EVERY CULTURE WHALE OR OTHERWISE IS SET OF SOLUTIONS ON HOW TO SURVIVE THE ENVIRONMENT
IN WHICH WE LIVE
IF WE LOSE A CULTURE WE LOSE ALL OF THE TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO SUCCEED
AND WE CAN'T NECESSARILY GET THAT BACK
EVEN IF THE GLOBAL POPULATION OF SPERM WHALES COULD MOVE BACK INTO THE CARIBBEAN THEY WOULD BE OTHER WHALES
THEY ROAM THEIR SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PROBABLY A WHOLE BUNCH OF CULTURAL WAYS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND YET AND THEY APPEAR TO IDENTIFY THESE
AND WHEN ONE IS BORN IT'S A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION THE GROUP OF SEVEN IS THE BEST STUDIED FAMILY OF SPERM WHALES IN THE WORLD AND THEY'VE TAUGHT ME ALL THE MINUTIAE OF LIFE AS FAMILY IN THE OPEN OCEAN THEY
BETWEEN THEIR VALUES AND OUR VALUES
HOW DIFFERENT CAN WE ALL BE
WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER
TO LIVE TOGETHER
ON THIS SHARED PLANET
WE NEED TO RESPECT ALL PEOPLE AND ALL SPECIES
IF WE'RE GOING TO PRESERVE LIFE OURS AND THEIRS
AND BABYSITTERS LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO ENIGMA I FOLLOWED ENIGMA'S FAMILY SINCE BEFORE HE WAS BORN
ANIMALS THAT YOU KNOW SO WELL HAS BEEN A TRAGEDY FOR ME AND FACED WITH THIS NEW REALITY I'VE ASKED MYSELF TWO QUESTIONS WHY
WHALES HAVE EVOLVED A SYSTEM OF ECHOLOCATION TO SEE IN THE DARK HER UNIQUE NOSE HAS EVOLVED AS THE MOST POWERFUL NATURAL
BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR
CARE FOR EACH OTHER
RESPECT DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO EVERYDAY PROBLEMS AND SHARE THE BURDEN OF YOUR DAY BY WORKING TOGETHER
IF I'VE LEARNED ONE THING FROM SPENDING TIME IN THE CULTURE OF WHALES IT'S THE POWER OF COMMUNITY
LIFE IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILD WITH THOSE AROUND US
AND THE WORST THING WE'VE EVER DONE TO THE CITIZENS OF THE OCEAN IS TO HAVE IGNORED THEM
WE'VE BEEN KILLING WHALES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BUT WE DO SO NOW OUT OF IGNORANCE RATHER THAN INTENT
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH AUTHORITY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
AND THEN QUESTION THOSE WHO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE REAL CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT WE INTERACT WITH OUR OCEANS
BUT THE SECOND QUESTION
SPERM WHALES HAVE BEEN SPERM WHALES FOR LONGER THAN WE'VE BEEN WALKING UPRIGHT
THEIR SOCIETIES ARE FAR OLDER THAN OUR SOCIETIES AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY SUCCEED IS THEIR CULTURAL SOLUTIONS
TRADITIONALLY WE'VE MANAGED WILDLIFE AROUND THE WORLD USING GENETICS STOCKS
BUT GENETICS CAN'T PRESERVE THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE
THE DIVERSITY IN A SPERM WHALE LIFE
IS IN THEIR CULTURAL
THE GROUP OF SEVEN BELONGS TO THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN CLAN AND IN THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN THEY USE ABOUT 22 DIFFERENT CODA PATTERNS
ONE TO RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS ANOTHER SET TO RECOGNIZE THE FAMILIES AND ONE UNIQUE ONE THAT THEY USE TO MARK THEIR CULTURAL CLAN
EVERY WHALE IN THE EASTERN
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE DEEP OCEAN AND ONLY TEN MINUTES OUT OF EVERY HOUR WILL BE SPENT IN THE PART OF THE OCEAN THAT THE LIGHT TOUCHES AS A RESULT HER WORLD IS A WORLD OF SOUND AND JUST LIKE
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GET A LITTLE BIT TALLER ON THE INHALE YEAH HOW YOU GET TALLER AND STRETCH UPWARDS AND ON THE EXHALE SORT OF SETTLE DOWN BECAUSE I'M SEEING IT
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR SURROUNDINGS THEY COULD BE PERFECTLY MUNDANE ROUTINE YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN FIGHT OR FLIGHT SO THIS CONNECTION TO STRESS IS WHAT GOT ME INTERESTED IN THE BREATH I WOKE UP ONE
TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX HOLD TWO CLOSE YOUR EYES TWO
WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BREATH
ANCIENT YOGIS SAY WE COME INTO THIS WORLD WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BREATHS
AND WE CAN TAKE THEM QUICKLY AND LIVE A SHORT LIFESPAN OR WE CAN TAKE THEM DEEPLY AND SLOWLY AND LIVE A LONG LIFESPAN
AND STARTED TEACHING NOW WHO DO YOU THINK WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT CALLED ME WAS IT MEMBERS OF THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY WAS IT
TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX HOLD TWO
TO GET THE AIR THAT YOU NEED
NOW HERE'S WHAT'S MOST FASCINATING FOR ME AS A PSYCHOLOGIST
THE VAGUS NERVE IS A NERVE THAT GOES TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD AND GOES THROUGHOUT YOUR WHOLE BODY VAGUS MEANS WANDERER IN LATIN AND IT DOES IT WANDERS THROUGHOUT YOUR WHOLE BODY PICKING UP SIGNALS TO TELL YOUR
WAY LONGEVITY AND HEALTH SO I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING I'M BREATHING WRONG HOW COULD THIS BE WELL RELAX IT'S NOT ALL YOUR FAULT SOMETIME BETWEEN THE
THAN YOUR TODDLER YOUR DOG YOUR CAT EVEN YOUR FISH
THEY BREATHE EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING IN THE MIDDLE
USING THE DIAPHRAGM
NOW MUCH OF THE CONFUSION AROUND BREATHING OCCURS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DIAPHRAGM IT'S A MUSCLE DEEP INSIDE IT'S DEPICTED AS THIS LITTLE RED LINE THAT CROSSES THE BODY
WHEN ACTUALLY IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE THIS ENORMOUS MUSCLE IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF YOUR BODY SEPARATING YOUR THORACIC CAVITY FROM YOUR DIGESTIVE ORGANS AND THE
SOMEONE POKES YOU IN THE BELLY
AND CALLS YOU FATTY
AND
HENCE STARTS YEARS EVEN DECADES OF GUT SUCKING SO EVEN NOW AS AN ADULT YOU'RE SUCKING IT IN
BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING IT MAKES YOU LOOK THINNER
BECAUSE IT'S AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO FEAR
BECAUSE IT'S A BRACING STANCE THAT HELPS YOU FEEL PREPARED TO RUN OR TO STRIKE
BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THE MYTH
THAT TENSING YOUR ABS MAKES YOUR CORE STRONGER
BUT THE
BREATH TO AN UPPER BODY BREATH AND IT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF SEVERAL THINGS
{LG} SO I WANT YOU TO TIP FORWARD INHALE LET YOUR BELLY GO READY TIP
ABOUT
CELLULAR RESPIRATION AND RATES OF OXYGEN EXCHANGE
I STUDIED BREATHING IN BIRTHING
FREEDIVING
SINGING
AND MARTIAL ARTS
WHAT WAS MOST ALARMING TO ME WAS WHEN I LOOKED AROUND
ALMOST EVERYONE I KNEW WASN'T BREATHING CORRECTLY
AND I KNEW
DO YOU HAVE DENTAL INSURANCE
I DIDN'T AND BEING A COMPULSIVE TYPE A I WASN'T JUST GRINDING MY TEETH I WAS PULVERIZING THEM
SO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LATER I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I WAS NOT CONTROLLING MY STRESS IT WAS CONTROLLING ME
IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE
I STARTED BY SIGNING UP FOR A YOGA CLASS WHERE WE WOULD DO BREATHING EXERCISES AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS I HEARD WORDS LIKE KAPALABHATI
UJJAYI
WE WOULD BREATHE THROUGH ONE NOSTRIL THEN THE OTHER WE WOULD DO BREATH HOLDS I WAS INTRIGUED
I DOVE IN HEADFIRST I TOOK EVERY CLASS I COULD FIND
TAKE A DEEP BREATH YES RIGHT NOW COME UP FROM THE BACK OF YOUR SEAT SIT UP STRAIGHT AND TAKE A BIG
GOES HERE THEY SAY TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND YOU THINK HM MY LUNGS MUST BE UP HERE
TO BE BREATHING MUSCLES SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S A SMALL MOVEMENT YOU'RE DOING IT THOUSANDS OF TIMES A DAY MILLIONS OF TIMES A YEAR
YEAR AFTER YEAR
SO IF YOU HAVE NECK AND SHOULDER PAIN JUST A LITTLE RIGHT YOU CAN BLAME THE CAR YOU CAN BLAME THE COMPUTER BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST BLAME YOUR BREATHING
SECOND THING IS THAT YOU'RE ONLY USING THE TOP PART OF YOUR LUNGS
WHERE'S THE BIGGEST MOST OXYGEN RICH PART OF YOUR LUNGS
RIGHT DOWN HERE TAKE YOUR HANDS PUT THEM THERE
FOUR FIVE SIX HOLD TWO INHALE TWO
TO YOUR STERNUM LIKE HANDLES ON A PAIL
ON THE INHALE THEY'RE MEANT TO MOVE OUT HORIZONTALLY
AND ON THE EXHALE THEY NARROW WITH YOUR BODY
WHAT BEAUTIFUL MACHINE THE BODY IS
BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME
BREATH IT COMES FROM THE MILITARY IT'S MY FAVORITE ONE IT'S CALLED TACTICAL
RESEARCH SAID THAT BREATH AFFECTS YOUR SLEEP
YOUR BACK
YOUR DIGESTION YOUR MEMORY ANXIETY ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS IT AFFECTS PARTS OF OUR BODY
THAT YOU'D NEVER EVEN CONSIDER LIKE ESOPHAGUS AND YOUR PELVIC FLOOR
IT'S AN ANATOMICALLY INCONGRUOUS WAY TO BREATHE MEANING THAT YOU'RE BREATHING OUT OF SYNC WITH YOUR BODY HOWEVER NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE BREATHE THIS WAY SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS
YOU GO WAS A TECHNOLOGY OR AN IDEA PIONEERED IN AFRICA BY A COMPANY CALLED VODACOM A GOOD 15 YEARS AGO AND
IS THE MOST FAMOUS INVENTOR YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF IN 1963 A STORM RIPPED UP THE HARBOR IN A SMALL SOUTH AFRICAN TOWN CALLED EAST
IS NOT THAT CATCHY CATCHPHRASE THIS IS INNOVATION OVER THE EDGE
EVERYBODY'S REALLY EXCITED ABOUT A LITTLE SQUARE OF PLASTIC THAT YOU PLUG INTO A PHONE AND YOU CAN SWIPE YOUR CREDIT CARD AND PEOPLE SAY WE'VE LIBERATED THE CREDIT CARD FROM THE POINT OF SALE TERMINAL
IS REAL INNOVATION AND I DEFINE IT AS PROBLEM SOLVING PEOPLE ARE SOLVING REAL PROBLEMS IN AFRICA WHY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BECAUSE WE HAVE REAL PROBLEMS
IT'S HAPPENING AT THE EDGE BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE EVERYBODY'S UPDATING FACEBOOK OR WORSE STILL THEY'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FACEBOOK'S PRIVACY SETTINGS {LG}
ERIC MERRIFIELD HAVE TO INVENT THE DOLOS BLANK
WHY DO YOU EVEN NEED A CREDIT CARD IN AFRICA WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING IT ON PHONES LIKE
WHAT WE NEED WE HAVE REALLY SEVERE ENERGY PROBLEMS IN AFRICA BY THE WAY YOU CAN UPDATE FACEBOOK AND SEND GMAIL FROM A PHONE LIKE THIS
ALSO A RADIO AND IT'S ALSO A TORCH AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IT HAS REALLY SUPERB BATTERY LIFE WHY
BILLS WITH IT YOU CAN BUY YOUR GROCERIES YOU CAN PAY YOUR KIDS' SCHOOL FEES AND I'M
IN KENYA IS A 463 MILLION BUSINESS
SHIPPING ECONOMY WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT AFRICAN TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS
AND WHILE HE WAS WATCHING HIS KIDS PLAYING WITH TOYS MADE FROM OXEN BONES CALLED DOLOSSE HE HAD THE IDEA FOR
IT'S MOBILE ONLY SO WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING ALL OF THOSE
HOW MANY OF YOU WHEN YOU ARRIVED HERE LIKE ME WENT AND BOUGHT PAY AS YOU GO SIM CARD
EVEN BRIBE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS {LG} SOMETHING LIKE 25 MILLION DOLLARS A DAY IS TRANSACTED THROUGH M
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SOME OTHER QUESTIONS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOUR HANDS UP THESE ARE
WE'RE GOING SO YOU HEAR THE WEST TALK ABOUT INNOVATION AT THE EDGE
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WORKED WITH IT BARS SALOONS ETC THE GOLD OF TODAY IS MOBILE AND MOBILE IS THE ENABLER THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT
BETWEEN A SUBSISTENCE FARMER AND AN ABUNDANCE FARMER IS ONLY A COUPLE OF LITERS OF MILK A DAY AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN RISE OUT OF POVERTY REALLY SIMPLE USING BASIC PHONE
ANGRY BIRDS
SO WHERE
IT'S HAPPENING IS IN AFRICA NOW THIS IS REAL INNOVATION NOT THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE EXPROPRIATED THE WORD TO TALK ABOUT LAUNCHING NEW PRODUCTS
PAY AS YOU GO IS ONE OF THE MOST DOMINANT FORCES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE
ABOUT IT AT HER BEDTIME AND IT'D BE THERE WITH HER WHEN SHE GOT UP IN THE MORNINGS I'D TAKE HER INTO NURSERY AND AS SOON AS SHE'D
BEING BULLIED AT WORK IS A LONELY PLACE TO BE AND WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHO'S GOT THEIR BACK
BUT THIS IS WHAT THIS LITTLE GIRL TAUGHT ME
THAT BRAVERY IS A HECK OF A LOT EASIER
IF YOU'VE BEEN EMPOWERED
AND IT GOT ME THINKING IF FOUR YEAR OLD CAN TAKE SUCH SIMPLE LITTLE PRINCIPLES AND USE THEM TO TURN AROUND THEIR OWN CONTEXT IN QUITE SHORT SPACE OF TIME AS WELL ALL BY HERSELF
THEN WHY COULDN'T SOME OF THIS THINKING APPLY TO THE WORKPLACE AS WELL
I THINK IT CAN
SO NUMBER ONE
PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU HAPPY
SO RECRUIT FOR VALUES
RECRUIT TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD A POSITIVE WORKING CULTURE PRESCREEN OUT THE BAD GUYS
NUMBER
AND OFF SHE WENT
AND WE CROSSED OUR FINGERS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
IN TWO OR THREE DAYS
SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
MAYBE SHE WAS SMILING A LITTLE BIT MORE OR
MAYBE LAUGHING A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT
AS THE DAYS WORE ON
SHE SEEMED TO EVERY DAY GET A LITTLE BIT STRONGER EVERY DAY SHE SEEMED TO GET JUST A LITTLE BIT BRAVER
EVERY DAY
SHE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CONFIDENCE BACK
AND WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY ON THE WAY INTO NURSERY SHE'D BE CARING BEHIND MY LEG
NOW SHE'D BE WALKING BESIDE ME HOLDING MY HAND
THE CIPD SAID A WHILE BACK
THEY THINK THAT EVERY YEAR THE UK ECONOMY LOSES 18 MILLION WORKING DAYS
TO WORKPLACE BULLYING
SICKNESS ABSENCE
ACAS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SAID THAT
THE SUM COST AND IMPACT TO THE UK ECONOMY EACH YEAR IS 18 BILLION POUNDS
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TO THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN COST
THE DESTROYED CAREERS
THE WRECKED HOME LIVES THE BROKEN DOWN RELATIONSHIPS
RIGHT AND SEE THAT SHE HAS GOT MY BACK AND IF I'VE GOT ALL OF YOUR BACKS AND IF YOU CAN ALL GO OUT AND EMPOWER EACH OTHER TO BE THE ONES BRAVE ENOUGH TO STEP ASIDE FROM THE CROWD AND SAY STOP
MAYBE WE COULD TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH WE THOUGHT MAYBE IF WE COULD GIVE SOME REALLY SIMPLE PRINCIPLES SOMETHING SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT A FOUR YEAR OLD COULD UNDERSTAND THEN MAYBE SHE COULD EMPOWER HERSELF WITH THIS TO TAKE ACTION
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IT'S OUR LEADERS AND MANAGERS WHO ARE DOING MOST OF THE BULLYING
THEY'RE ALSO THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING US FROM BULLYING
THEY'RE MARKING THEIR OWN HOMEWORK
ROBERT SUTTON SAID
HOW WE TREAT THOSE LESS POWERFUL THAN OURSELVES IS AS GOOD A MEASURE OF HUMAN CHARACTER AS I KNOW
I AGREE WITH THAT
BUT YET YOU'VE SHOWN ME THOSE ORGANIZATIONS BOLD ENOUGH BRAVE ENOUGH OF SUFFICIENT MORAL FIBRE
TO FIRE
A STAR PERFORMER
IF THEY'RE CAUGHT BULLYING
DADDY
SOMEONE WAS REALLY NASTY TO ME TODAY
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT AH YOU KNOW KIDS THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO BUMBLE THEIR WAY THROUGH LIFE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THESE COMPLEX RULES OF HOW TO LIVE AND NOT BE NASTY TO PEOPLE IT'S COMPLEX FOR SMALL PEOPLE LIKE THESE YOUNG LITTLE TODDLERS
BUT
THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND SHE CAME BACK AND SAID DADDY SOMEONE'S BEEN REALLY REALLY NASTY AND
THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN
AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT HAD BEEN TWO THREE WEEKS
AND WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS BEING BULLIED
AT THIS AGE I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS WAS A THING
MAYBE I'M NAIVE
AND WE SPOKE TO THE NURSERY AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE GREAT THEY WERE BRILLIANT
BUT THE
PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND OF BULLYING IS THAT
IT OFTEN HAPPENS BACKSTAGE DOESN'T IT WHEN NO ONE'S LOOKING
ON THIS YEAR
AND WHEN THE RESEARCHERS WERE LOOKING THROUGH ALL OF THE INTERVIEWS AND THE SURVEYS WITH KIDS AGED 8 TO 17 WHAT
DO YOU THINK THE BIG COMMON THEMES WERE THAT WERE COMING THROUGH
WHAT WERE THE WORDS THAT CHILDREN WERE MOST USING MORE OFTEN THAN ANY OTHERS TO DESCRIBE THEIR LIVES THEIR ENVIRONMENTS AND EXPERIENCES
FRIENDS'
FAMILY'
AND BULLYING
THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THESE CHILDREN SAID THAT THEY'D BEEN HIT BY CLASSMATE IN THE LAST MONTH
FIFTY PERCENT OF THEM SAID THAT THEY'D BEEN LEFT OUT BY THEIR PEERS
IN THE LAST MONTH
AND THE REST OF THE REPORT'S PRETTY GRIM READING AS WELL BUT HERE'S THE HEADLINE FOR YOU OUT
OF 15 COUNTRIES ACROSS EUROPE ASIA AND
AFRICA
28000 CHILDREN I THINK THEY SPOKE TO
THE KIDS IN THE UK ARE UNHAPPIER AT SCHOOL THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS AND PEERS IN PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND
IT GOT ME THINKING
IF THIS IS CASE FOR OUR CHILDREN
WHAT HOPE IS THERE FOR THE ADULTS THEY BECOME
WHAT HOPE IS THERE FOR THE SOCIETY THAT WE'RE BUILDING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TOO LATE BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY BUILT IT
BECAUSE BULLYING IS NOT JUST A SCHOOL YARD
SWEETHEART
OK
I'VE GOT THREE RULES FOR YOU
NUMBER ONE
PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU HAPPY
I LIKE THAT ONE
NUMBER TWO
THOSE PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU SAD ALL THE TIME NOT YOUR FRIENDS DARLING
NUMBER THREE
IF SOMEONE ELSE IS MAKING YOUR FRIENDS SAD
YOU'D BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
GOT IT
HIGH FIVE
THIS OTHER KID THAT WAS DOING THE BULLYING SHE WOULD PHYSICALLY RECOIL AND HIDE BEHIND MY LEG WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND I WALKED INTO THE ROOM AND I SAW IN THE CORNER A WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR AND SHE WAS BANGING A NAKED BABY DOLL ON A TABLE
ONLY FOR OUR ELDERS BUT FOR US ALL SO AS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER I DECIDED THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING I WANTED TO EXPLORE IN A FILM
I'M NOT RUNNING AROUND DOING 15 DIFFERENT THINGS
AT ONCE THEN I'M SOMEHOW NOT USING MY TIME WISELY
SO I'M MULTITASKING FROM THE TIME I WAKE UP TO THE TIME I GO TO BED AND AM ALWAYS PRESSED FOR TIME
IN FACT ONE MORNING
I WAS DROPPING MY OLDEST SON OFF AT PRESCHOOL AND
WE PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT AND I SAID
WE'RE EARLY
AND HE REPLIED IN ALL SINCERITY WHAT DOES EARLY MEAN
WITH ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO VIVID
AND THAT JUST MADE ME SO CURIOUS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS MAN AND WHO HE HAD BEEN IN HIS LIFE UP UNTIL THIS POINT
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW
FOR ALL OF US WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO
REALLY BE IN THE MOMENT AND TO BE PRESENT
AND
FOR
CONSIDERED A BAD THING AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT WHAT ARE THE REPERCUSSIONS OF APPROACHING LIFE IN THAT WAY
I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS AND HERE'S WHY THERE'S CONCEPT THAT SCHOLARS REFER TO AS GENERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
AND
BASICALLY WHAT IT MEASURES IS A PERSON'S ABILITY TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THE SHOES OF SOMEBODY OF A DIFFERENT GENERATION
SO
THE US CENSUS PREDICTS THAT BY THE YEAR 2050 OUR ELDERLY POPULATION WILL HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED
SO THIS IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE IMPORTANT IN THE COMING YEARS
LIVING INTERGENERATIONALLY
IS A HUGE PART OF THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF LIFE
WHERE I FILMED WAS INUNDATED WITH MEDIA REQUESTS AND THEY'VE GIVEN TOURS
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO GROUPS COMING AS FAR AWAY AS NEW ZEALAND AND NORWAY AND THE NETHERLANDS ALL PEOPLE INTERESTED
IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO REPLICATE THIS MODEL IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BACK HOME
AND ALL OF THIS IS JUST SO VERY EXCITING TO ME BECAUSE
WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE STORY THAT REALLY STRUCK A CHORD
AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST STORY ABOUT THE VERY YOUNG AND THE VERY OLD
IT'S REALLY A STORY ABOUT US ALL
SO
ON THAT NOTE I GOT AN EMAIL
FROM THE HEADMASTER OF SCHOOL IN AUGUSTA GEORGIA A FEW WEEKS AGO AND HE SENT SOME PHOTOS AS WELL AND I WANT TO SHARE AN EXCERPT OF IT WITH YOU
AND SOMETHING TOTALLY UNEXPECTED AND AMAZING HAPPENED THE STORY GOT PICKED UP BY NEWS OUTLETS ALL OVER THE WORLD I ENDED UP BEING INTERVIEWED FOR TELEVISION AND RADIO AND BLOGS AND PODCASTS AND
IT'S CALLING YOUR GRANDPARENTS OR
STRIKING UP A CONVERSATION WITH THE OLDER WOMAN THAT YOU SEE AT YOUR BUS STOP EVERY DAY
OR MAKING A POINT OF VISITING AT LOCAL RETIREMENT HOME
ONCE A MONTH
OR MAYBE STARTING AN INTERGENERATIONAL BOOK CLUB IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS BUT THE POINT IS THAT ANYONE CAN DO IT AT ANY TIME AND JUST IMAGINE WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT COULD MAKE
I EXPLAINED THAT I JUST WANTED TO EMBED MYSELF IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND
SO IN THE SPRING OF 2012 I WAS AT A PARTY TALKING TO A FRIEND AND SHE MENTIONED THAT SHE KNEW OF
A
RETIREMENT HOME IN WEST SEATTLE THAT HAD PRESCHOOL HOUSED INSIDE OF IT
AND
I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS SO COOL AND I WAS SURPRISED I HADN'T EVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE SO I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS NEW BUT IN FACT IT ISN'T NEW IT'S BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION FOR ALMOST 25 YEARS SO
RETIREMENT HOME TO SING CHRISTMAS CAROLS ONE YEAR
AND
WE HAD NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE SO ON OUR WAY THEY WERE COACHING US AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT
THE RESIDENTS WERE GONNA BE SUPER EXCITED TO SEE US AND WE NEEDED TO BE REALLY FRIENDLY AND SMILE AND SHAKE PEOPLE'S HANDS
AND I WAS TOTALLY PREPARED TO DO THAT
RIGHT UNTIL
AND WHEN WE ENCOURAGE RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS GENERATIONS THEN WE ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO PROVIDE AND RECEIVE VALUABLE
AND JUST PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE WAYS THAT OUR CULTURE REINFORCES THIS IDEA THAT INCREASING AGE EQUALS DECREASING VALUE
AND
THERE'S A LOT SO TO BEGIN THERE'S THE YOU KNOW OUR EMPHASIS ON OUTWARD APPEARANCE AND THE ENDLESS ADS FROM COSMETIC AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING US PRODUCTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP US HIDE OUR AGE
THERE'S
MEDIA REPRESENTATIONS OF OLDER ADULTS WHICH WHEN THEY HAPPEN
THEY'RE VERY RARELY NORMAL THEY'RE LIKE ZANY CARICATURES LIKE
LIKE MRS DOUBTFIRE FOR EXAMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN THERE'S THE FACT THAT NURSING HOMES EXIST AND THEY'RE THESE DEPRESSING PLACES
THAT NOBODY EVER WANTS TO END UP
AND WE KIND OF JUST OLD PEOPLE GO THERE AND LIVE OUT THE REST OF THEIR DAYS MOSTLY CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY
BUT WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW DID HOW DO WE EVEN GET TO THIS PLACE WHERE GROWING OLD IS
LOVED GETTING THAT EMAIL BECAUSE I THINK HIS SENTIMENT GETS TO THE HEART OF
WHAT I THINK IS SO BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THIS WHOLE CONCEPT WHICH IS JUST THAT IT IS SO SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT AND YET I FEEL LIKE THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF IT COULD BE HUGE
I MEAN WE DON'T NEED POLITICIANS TO HELP US MAKE THIS HAPPEN WE DON'T NEED TO RAISE LOTS OF MONEY
JUST BE A FLY ON THE WALL
SO THAT I COULD JUST CAPTURE WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SPACE
AND AND THEY LET ME DO IT WHICH WAS AWESOME AND I SPENT A YEAR FILMING AT PROVIDENCE MOUNT ST VINCENT WHICH IS A RETIREMENT HOME IN WEST SEATTLE AND
THE INTERGENERATIONAL LEARNING CENTER WHICH IS THE PRESCHOOL THAT'S HOUSED INSIDE OF IT
GONNA BE OLD AND FOR ME THINK IT WAS IN MY MID TO LATE 20S
WHEN I WAS JUST MORE OF A GROWNUP THAN I EVER IMAGINED I WOULD BE
AND IT FINALLY HIT ME THAT I WAS GOING TO BE OLD SOMEDAY AND
I WASN'T LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
FRIENDS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS AND THE GUY WHOSE STORE IT WAS WAS RATHER DISMISSIVE BUT I BOUGHT IT ANYWAY AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO LONDON I WAS SO FASCINATED BY IT THAT I BEGAN A
ILLEGAL YOU ARE UNDER ARREST IT'S PRETTY INCONCEIVABLE RIGHT BUT IF WE GO BACK 70 YEARS TO RUSSIA
YOU CAN RECORD MUSIC ON TO VARIOUS TYPES OF PLASTIC BUT HUMAN BEINGS AS WE KNOW ARE INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF OPPRESSION SOME VERY CLEVER RESOURCEFUL PERSON HAD COME
THE POLISH THE RUSSIANS AND THE AMERICANS WERE ON THE SAME TEAM SO FOR WHILE IN RUSSIA JAZZ WAS OK THERE WERE RUSSIAN JAZZ BANDS MANY OF THEM VERY POPULAR
YOU COULD WATCH AMERICAN FILMS WITH JAZZ SOUNDTRACKS IN RUSSIA YOUNG PEOPLE LOVED IT OF COURSE BUT WHEN THAT WAR ENDED AND A
WOULD DECIDE IF THAT PIECE OF ART IF THAT BOOK IF THAT SONG WAS IN THE SERVICE OF SOCIALIST REALISM OF COURSE I'M IN POLAND YOU HAVE SOME OF THIS HISTORY YOURSELF
FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE AND BOGOSLOWSKI MANAGES TO MAKE A RECORDING MACHINE
AND THEY MAKE THEIR FIRST RECORDING
BUT I'VE MISSED SOMETHING OUT
THIS IS THE SOVIET UNION WHAT WERE THEY RECORDING ON TO
TOO HAVE THOUSANDS OF SONGS ON MY COMPUTER AND I LOVE IT IT'S AMAZING TO HAVE SO MUCH ABUNDANCE I WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP I HEAR MUSIC EVERY DAY
TO YOU YOU'VE GOT A SONG BY THE BRITISH BAND THE REAL TUESDAY WELD' AND THAT IS FORBIDDEN IT'S INCONCEIVABLE ISN'T IT IT'S INCONCEIVABLE YOU HAVE A SONG BY MY BAND ON YOUR MP3 PLAYER
THEY'D BEEN BIG STARS BUT THEY DIDN'T COME BACK TO THE SOVIET UNION TO JOIN IN THE GREAT COMMUNIST PROJECT THEY BECAME EFFECTIVELY TRAITORS SO THEIR RECORDS WERE EVEN IF THEY WERE SINGING ABOUT
THAT POOR OLD STANIS AW PHILO STARTED TO LOSE HIS CUSTOMERS THEY MOVED OVER TO THESE GUYS THEY BECAME SO BUSY THEY GOT A FRIEND INVOLVED THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE GOLDEN DOG GANG
AW PHILO AND HE WAS CARRYING WITH HIM A MOST EXTRAORDINARY
BUT HE KNEW IT WAS FORBIDDEN HE SAID TO STANIS AW PHILO CAN I BUY THAT AND PHILO SAID NO BUT COME BACK WHEN THE SHOP IS CLOSED AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
FORBIDDEN HE'S ALSO GOT IN THOSE BOXES SOME OUTRIGHT ILLEGAL RECORDS BUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER WHY WOULD A NICE YOUNG MAN LIKE NICK MARKOVICH
BOGOSLOWSKI WAS TAKEN TO COURT THERE WAS A TRIAL HE WAS GIVEN FIVE YEARS IN THE GULAG FOR COPYING MUSIC
BORIS TAIGIN WAS GIVEN SEVEN YEARS HE WAS GIVEN AN EXTRA TWO YEARS BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN WRITING AND RECORDING HIS OWN SONGS
FORTUNATELY FOR THEM TWO YEARS LATER
STALIN DIED
WE CUT NEW X RAY RECORDS IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES
WHAT WOULD I BE LOSING
WHAT WOULD I RISK TO GET IT BACK
CAN MUSIC STILL
CAUSE A REVOLUTION IN MY BLOOD
IN MY BONE
WHY NOT NEXT TIME WE'RE FLICKING THROUGH OUR MP3 PLAYER LOOKING AT ALL THE THOUSANDS OF SONGS WE'VE GOT THINKING AH WHAT SHALL I LISTEN TO MAYBE THINK BACK TO A TIME WHEN THE
A VERY GOOD IDEA WHY BECAUSE IN THE SOVIET UNION THE GOVERNMENT HAD ISSUED AN ORDER THAT ALL HOSPITALS HAD TO GET RID OF THEIR X RAYS AFTER YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE A
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS IN RUSSIA WITH MY BAND THE REAL TUESDAY WELD WE'D BEEN PLAYING SOME CONCERTS AND AFTERWARDS I WENT TO FLEA MARKET
THE SECRET GOT OUT HOW TO RECORD ONTO X RAYS THIS STARTED TO SPREAD OTHER PEOPLE IN LENINGRAD STARTED TO DO IT TOO
HE CAME TO SEE US IN AN APARTMENT IN MOSCOW AND HE BROUGHT WITH HIM HIS PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYER AND
FROM BEFORE THE WAR IS BANNED
YOU HAVE A WHOLE CULTURE
CUT OFF
FROM ITS CULTURE
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE SAYING TO US YOU CAN NO LONGER LISTEN TO THE BEATLES AND OF COURSE THE STATES COMPLETELY CONTROL THE RECORDING INDUSTRY THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO GET THIS MUSIC APART FROM IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES AT HIGH COST
IT DIDN'T MATTER IN A WAY THEY WERE PRECIOUS OBJECTS BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO WHAT THEY WANTED WHEN THEY WANTED UNFORTUNATELY FOR BOGOSLOWSKI HE WAS CAUGHT
MAN HE WAS AN AUDIOPHILE HE WAS MUSIC LOVER HE WAS NOT A DISSIDENT HE DIDN'T WANT TO BRING THE SYSTEM DOWN OR CORRUPT SOVIET YOUTH HE WAS A MUSIC LOVER AND HE BELIEVED THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE MUSIC UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS CAUGHT AGAIN
TWENTY THOUSAND RIGHT OK WELL LOOK WE'RE USED TO LISTENING TO WHATEVER WE WANT WHEN WE WANT WE HAVE ABUNDANCE BUT YOU SIR FOR THE
EXPENSIVE ON THE BLACK MARKET THEN BOGOSLOWSKI TAKES OUT HIS NOTEBOOK AND SHOWS HIM FOR WEEKS HE'S SECRETLY BEEN MAKING DRAWINGS AND MEASUREMENTS OF STANIS AW PHILO'S
HIS MACHINE IN THE CORNER FOR A FEW RUBLES PEOPLE COULD COME IN AND USE A MICROPHONE TO MAKE A RECORDING OF THEIR VOICE ONTO A PLASTIC DISC LIKE A SOUVENIR HIS BUSINESS STARTED TO DO AMAZINGLY WELL
THROUGH THE NOISE AND HISS AND CRACKLE AND STATIC THERE WAS A THIN RIBBON OF
ARE IMAGES OF PAIN AND DAMAGE INSCRIBED WITH THE SOUNDS OF PLEASURE THEY ARE PICTURES OF THE INTERIOR OF SOVIET CITIZENS IMPRESSED WITH THE MUSIC THEY SECRETLY LOVED THEY WERE SOLD ON STREET
TAIGIN WOULDN'T IT BE AMAZING IF APART FROM JUST BUYING THESE BOOTLEG RECORDS WE COULD MAKE OUR OWN AND TAIGIN SAID IT WOULD BE AMAZING
TIME IN THE CULTURE IN MUSIC THERE WERE LOTS OF EXPERIMENTAL AMAZING THINGS HAPPENING BUT AS THE YEARS WENT BY THE STATES GOT MORE AND MORE INVOLVED WITH WHAT THE PRODUCTS OF CULTURE SHOULD BE AND BY 1932
OK SO WHO'S GOT MORE THAN 1000 SONGS ON THAT DEVICE OR ON THEIR LAPTOP
BUT I SET UP THE X RAY AUDIO PROJECT TO TELL THE STORY OF PEOPLE LIKE BOGOSLOWSKI AND TAIGIN THE OTHER BOOTLEGGERS AND WITH MY FRIEND PAUL HARTFIELD
AND OUR SPROUTS BEGIN TO SHAPE AND THE TREE OF LIFE ESCAPES BRANCHING OUT IN LOVE OR HATE TO DESTROY OR TO CREATE
THE BOUNDARIES IN THE DIRT SO HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER SHOULD BE HOW WE MEASURE OUR WORTH AND
GOD AS AN EXCUSE TO KILL AT WILL BECAUSE HE'S ON MY SIDE LIKE GOD WOULD CHOOSE A SIDE AGAINST ANOTHER SIDE
AND I'M NOT SAYING DON'T PROTECT YOURSELF PROTECT YOURSELF BUT KNOW THAT REVENGE IS AGAINST YOURSELF
TEMPLE EVERYWHERE'S A CHURCH EVERYWHERE'S A MOSQUE JUST SHOW ME WHERE IT
IS A CIRCLE RIGHT IF IT WASN'T SELF DEFENSE THEN IT WAS MY INTERNAL FIGHT
PEACE WITHOUT WAR WOULD BE HARD ENOUGH IT'S NOT US VERSUS THEM IT'S NOT US VERSUS US IT'S JUST US {NS} THANK YOU
BECAUSE ONCE THE CONFLICT HAS STARTED I FORGET THE GOAL YEAH I KNOW I'M
SO WE SHOULD QUESTION EVERY SINGLE THING WE'RE TOLD IF WE TOOK ALL THE ENERGY WE SPENT ON WAGING WAR AND PUT IT INTO SOLVING OUR DISPUTES INSTEAD OF MAKING MORE THEN MAYBE WE COULD FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT WE THINK WE'RE FIGHTING FOR AND SOLDIERS WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE AND DIE IN REVOLVING DOOR
ENEMY IS A MIRROR IF I'M WILLING TO BE FEARLESS I COULD
THE WORLD CHANGE YOURSELF AND IT WILL START MAKE
EVERY SINGLE THING WE SEE STARTED PLANTED IN OUR BRAINS
ASSUME TO KNOW TAKE IT IN BUT DON'T TAKE IT ON OR I'LL RESPOND BY TAKING PEOPLE
YOU BREAK A SWEAT AND YOUR EARS CAN HEAR YOUR HEART'S BEAT BEAT
THE GUN THAT'S POINTING AT MYSELF I COULD BE DROPPING THE
TO COMMENT ON YOUR GRIEF WHEN I HAVEN'T KNOW THE DEPTHS OF YOUR EXPERIENCE OR YOUR BELIEFS
ENTIRE STARTING LINEUP OVERNIGHT TO SUICIDE
WHO'S LOVED AND SUPPORTED ME
INSTRUCTORS WHO DEDICATE THEIR TIME TO TEACH THESE VETERANS THROUGH SKYPE AND OTHER INTERNET APPLICATIONS WE SHIP THE VETERAN THE
AT THAT MOMENT FULL BATTLE RATTLE WAS BORN WE NOW TEACH FOURTEEN COMBAT
FOUND MYSELF IN ONE OF THESE POSITIONS NINE SHORT MONTHS AGO IN JANUARY OF 2014 I HAD
TODAY WHEN NINE SHORT MONTHS AGO IT WAS AN IDEA YOU KNOW THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE SUPPORT
YOUR GUITAR HAD CHANGED YOU JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO YOU WERE HATING LIFE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S FOR DINNER
AND I REACHED I REACHED FOR SOMETHING THAT FELT INCONSEQUENTIAL TO ME SOMETHING THAT I FELT WOULD JUST INTERRUPT THE PROCESS JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING ELSE TO FOCUS ON
THAT MEANS ALMOST EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY OUR NATION LOSES A HERO WE LOSE A
IT'S DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR A GUN OR A COMBINATION OF THOSE THEY GET SCARED AND THEY GET
AND SHE WAS RIGHT SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT'S ALL IT TOOK PLAYING JUST A FEW CHORDS ON MY GUITAR TO CHANGE ME AND TO REFOCUS WHAT I WAS FEELING AT THAT TIME
OF NATIONAL HEROES EVERY DAY THAT
IS PROBABLY THE MOST REMOTE CITY ON EARTH THERE IS REALLY NOTHING CLOSE TO IT GEOGRAPHICALLY IT ALSO SHARES SOMETHING UNIQUE WITH PHILADELPHIA IN THAT IT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE SPOT ON THE PLANET FROM THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS AND PEOPLE TOLD US IF WE DUG FAR ENOUGH WE WOULD GET TO CHINA
THAT'S NOT TRUE YOUR'RE GONNA GET TO PERTH
SO
THERE WE WERE WE WERE SITTING ON THE BEACH AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE ILLUSTRATION IT'S ABOUT SUNSET
AND WE REALIZED THAT WE WERE AS FAR FROM HOME AS WE WERE EVER GOING TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY EXCEPT FOR THAT GUY IN SPACE THIS IS AS FAR AS WE WERE GONNA GET
FIVE MILES IN ANY DIRECTION WAS GOING TO SEND US CLOSER TO HOME AND BACK TO OUR FORMER LIFE
AND SUDDENLY THAT DIDN'T SEEM SO APPEALING
WE REALIZED THAT OUR LIFE WAS CHANGING AND WE WERE CHANGING WITH IT
AND WE DIDN'T WANNA GO BACK TO THAT FORMER LIFE
WE REALIZED THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WITH THE EXPERIENCES WE HAD HAD A NEW PHASE OF OUR LIFE HAD BEGUN
AND THAT WAS THE A HA MOMENT SO WE WATCHED THAT SUN AND THAT SUN DIDN'T SET I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MELTED IT MELTED INTO THE INDIAN OCEAN AND IT TOOK OUR OLD LIFE
WITH IT
WHICH
WHO WOULD'VE THINK BUT WE LEARNED THAT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD KNOW LITTLE
TO TRAVEL
AND PART OF OUR GOAL WAS TO GO A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY THAN WE EVER HAD BEFORE WE HAD NEVER HAD A WHOLE YEAR TO TRAVEL
AND WE TRAVELLED THROUGH CHINA AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND
WHEN WE COULD WE COULD STAY IN APARTMENTS
SO THAT WE COULD IMMERSE OURSELVES IN THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD AND LOCAL CULTURE WE SHOPPED AT THE MARKETS WE MET PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE TRIED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCES THAT WE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE WE ENGAGED WITH PEOPLE WE STAYED AT A CATTLE RANCH IN THE AUSTRALIAN BUSH COUNTRY WHERE I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THIS HAPPENED BUT I ENDED UP BOTTLE FEEDING MOTHERLESS CALF AND ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS NOT A FARM GIRL REALLY NOT SO DEFINITELY STEPPING OUTSIDE THE COMFORT ZONE
BUT AFTER A WHILE SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENED TO US IN ANY KIND OF MAJOR EVENT IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE THERE'S USUALLY SOME SORT OF A HA MOMENT WHERE THE CLOUDS PART THE SUN COMES OUT AND YOU HEAR THE CHOIR IN THE BACK GOING AHAAA WELL FOR
US THIS OCCURRED ON THE WEST COAST OF AUSTRALIA IN THE CITY OF PERTH
HE'S NOT REAL CHARACTER BECAUSE HE REALLY IS
BUT WE BROUGHT LITTLE ROCKY WITH US THE OBJECTIVE WAS PROBABLY SIMILAR TO WHAT SOME THINGS THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WE WERE GOING TO TAKE PHOTOS OF US WITH HIM ON MAJOR WORLD LANDMARKS THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA
THE SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE ETC AND THIS WAS GOING TO FORM A PHOTO ALBUM FOR US
BUT
AN INTERESTING THING HAPPENED AS WE WERE CHANGING LITTLE ROCKY
AMAZING FOR US SO NOW WHAT NOW WE'VE GOT
OR YOUR SMARTPHONE
PAPER MAPS ARE BECOMING
OBSOLETE
BUT WE NOW STAND ON THE VERGE OF ANOTHER REVOLUTION
IN GEOLOCATION ACCURACY
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THE TWO METER POSITIONING THAT OUR CURRENT CELL PHONES AND OUR TOMTOMS GIVE US
IS PATHETIC COMPARED TO WHAT WE COULD BE GETTING
FOR SOME TIME NOW IT'S BEEN KNOWN THAT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE CARRIER PHASE OF THE GPS SIGNAL AND IF YOU HAVE AN INTERNET
CARRIER PHASE BASED POSITIONING WILL BECOME CHEAP AND UBIQUITOUS AND THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE FANTASTIC THE HOLY
ON A WAVE BUBBLE MIGHT NOT JUST CAUSE INCONVENIENCE
IT MIGHT BE
DEADLY
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT FOR PURPOSES OF PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY
AT THE EXPENSE OF GENERAL GPS RELIABILITY
THERE'S SOMETHING EVEN MORE POTENT
AND MORE SUBVERSIVE
THAN A WAVE BUBBLE
AND THAT IS A GPS SPOOFER
GPS DOTS IN BULK AND YOU'LL STICK THEM ON EVERYTHING YOU OWN WORTH MORE THAN A FEW TENS OF DOLLARS I
BETTER SENSITIVITY SO MUCH SO THAT A FEW YEARS
RELATIONSHIP WITH GPS WE'RE ALMOST BLINDLY RELIANT ON IT IT'S BUILT DEEPLY INTO OUR SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SOME CALL IT THE INVISIBLE UTILITY
LEVEL OF POSITIONING THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND I BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS I PREDICT THAT THIS KIND OF HYPER
GMAIL REMEMBER HOW REFRESHING IT WAS TO GO FROM ORGANIZING ALL OF YOUR EMAIL TO SIMPLY SEARCHING IT THE GPS DOT WILL DO THE SAME FOR OUR POSSESSIONS NOW OF COURSE
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR
THE SUPREME COURT RULED LAST MONTH THAT A POLICEMAN HAS TO GET A WARRANT IF HE WANTS TO DO PROLONGED TRACKING
BUT THE LAW ISN'T CLEAR ABOUT CIVILIANS DOING THIS TO ONE ANOTHER
SO IT'S NOT JUST
BIG BROTHER WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
THERE
IS
ONE ALTERNATIVE THAT CAROL COULD HAVE TAKEN
VERY EFFECTIVE
IT'S CALLED THE WAVE BUBBLE
YOU'RE CAROL YOU COULD LURE YOUR EX BOYFRIEND INTO SOME EMPTY PARKING LOT WHERE THE POLICE ARE WAITING FOR HIM SO I'M FASCINATED
WELL THEN YOU'D BETTER GO TO THE POLICE I SAID
I ALREADY HAVE SHE REPLIED
THEY'RE NOT SURE THIS RISES TO THE LEVEL OF HARASSMENT
AND THEY'RE NOT SET UP TECHNICALLY TO FIND THE DEVICE
OKAY WHAT ABOUT THE FBI I'VE TALKED TO THEM TOO
AND SAME STORY
WE THEN TALKED ABOUT HER COMING TO MY LAB AND US PERFORMING A RADIO SWEEP OF HER CAR
BUT I WASN'T EVEN SURE THAT WOULD WORK
GIVEN THAT SOME OF THESE DEVICES ARE CONFIGURED TO ONLY TRANSMIT WHEN THEY'RE INSIDE SAFE ZONES OR WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING
SO THERE WE WERE CAROL
A FLIP SIDE TO THE GPS DOT
I WAS IN MY OFFICE SOME MONTHS BACK AND GOT A TELEPHONE CALL
THE WOMAN ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE WE'LL CALL HER CAROL
WAS PANICKED
APPARENTLY AN EX BOYFRIEND OF CAROL'S FROM CALIFORNIA HAD FOUND HER IN TEXAS AND WAS FOLLOWING HER AROUND
SO YOU MIGHT ASK AT THIS POINT WHY SHE'S CALLING YOU
WELL SO
THE WAVE BUBBLE SOUNDS GREAT
I SHOULD HAVE ONE MIGHT COME IN HANDY IF SOMEBODY EVER PUTS A TRACKING DEVICE ON MY CAR
BUT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT ITS USE IS VERY MUCH ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES
AND WHY IS THAT WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BUBBLE AT ALL
ITS JAMMING SIGNALS DON'T
RIGHT FOR ONE THING GPS DOESN'T WORK INDOORS AND FOR ANOTHER THEY DON'T
OF PROMISE AND PERIL IT'LL BE FASCINATING TO SEE HOW THIS ALL TURNS OUT
BUT WE KNOW THAT IN THE WORLD OF NONFICTION THE
MEANS THAT I GOT A LITTLE EXTRA HELP FROM MY THREE YEAR OLD SON RAMON
AT THE TIME
THE CHANGE WAS SILENT
IMPERCEPTIBLE UNLESS YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK FOR
ON THAT MORNING U S PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON ORDERED THAT A SPECIAL SWITCH BE THROWN IN THE ORBITING SATELLITES OF THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
INSTANTANEOUSLY
EVERY CIVILIAN GPS RECEIVER AROUND THE GLOBE
WENT FROM ERRORS THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD
TO ERRORS THE SIZE OF A SMALL ROOM
OF A GPS DOT
MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE A WHOLE BAG FULL OF THEM
YOU'LL NEVER LOSE TRACK OF YOUR THINGS AGAIN
THE GPS DOT WILL FUNDAMENTALLY REORDER YOUR LIFE
BUT WILL YOU BE ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION
TO TRACK YOUR FELLOW MAN
OR WILL YOU BE ABLE TO RESIST THE
BUT IT TURNED OUT THERE WAS A TECHNICAL TWIST TO CAROL'S CASE
EVERY TIME HER EX BOYFRIEND WOULD SHOW UP
AT THE MOST IMPROBABLE TIMES AND THE MOST IMPROBABLE LOCATIONS
HE WAS CARRYING AN OPEN LAPTOP
AND OVER TIME CAROL REALIZED
THAT HE HAD PLANTED A GPS TRACKING DEVICE ON HER CAR
SO SHE WAS CALLING ME FOR HELP TO DISABLE IT
WELL YOU SHOULD GO TO A GOOD MECHANIC AND HAVE HIM LOOK AT YOUR CAR I SAID
I ALREADY HAVE SHE TOLD ME
HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING OBVIOUS AND HE SAID HE'D HAVE TO TAKE THE CAR APART PIECE BY
YOU A STRUCTURE UP HERE IN 3D MILLIMETER ACCURATE THAT ONLY YOU COULD SEE OR MY FRIENDS AT HOME
WAVE BUBBLE
BUT IN FACT THE RESULTS CAN BE DISASTROUS
IMAGINE FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN OF A CRUISE SHIP TRYING TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH A THICK FOG
AND SOME PASSENGER IN THE BACK TURNS ON A WAVE BUBBLE
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR GPS READOUT GOES BLANK
AND NOW IT'S JUST YOU AND THE FOG
AND WHATEVER YOU CAN PULL OFF THE RADAR SYSTEM IF YOU REMEMBER HOW TO WORK IT
THEY IN FACT
THEY DON'T UPDATE OR UPKEEP
LIGHTHOUSES ANYMORE
AND LORAN THE ONLY BACKUP TO GPS WAS DISCONTINUED LAST YEAR
OUR MODERN
SHE FELT THREATENED BY GPS TRACKING
THEN SHE POSTED HER DESIGN TO THE WEB
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO BUILD YOUR OWN
YOU CAN BUY ONE CHINESE MANUFACTURERS NOW SELL THOUSANDS OF NEARLY IDENTICAL DEVICES
ON THE INTERNET
SO YOU MIGHT BE
UNINVENTED TECHNOLOGY BUT MEANWHILE GRAB SOME POPCORN BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING TO GET INTERESTING
SMALL ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE DEVICES HAVE TO RELAY THEIR MEASUREMENTS BACK OVER NETWORK WELL THESE OBJECTIONS WERE PERFECTLY REASONABLE FEW YEARS AGO BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED THERE'S BEEN A STRONG
AUGMENTED REALITY APP THAT OVERLAYS A VIRTUAL WORLD TO MILLIMETER LEVEL PRECISION ON TOP OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD I
{NS} AND MAYBE FOR THOSE WHO DO BUT DON'T UNDERSTAND MY POLISH {LG} I WANT TO TALK TODAY ABOUT A CONCEPT WHICH DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE A CONCEPT WHICH I HAVE
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THE ONE THING THE EASTERN EUROPE STILL HAS IS THAT IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE WEST AND THAT'S KIND OF TRUE IN THE 2007 2013 FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE IN THE EU TENS OF BILLIONS OF EUROS WENT
20 YEARS AGO WAS NOT EVEN ON THE MAP WELL
20 YEARS AND
TWO MONTHS AGO A
COUNTRY WHICH PEOPLE JUST WROTE OFF AS ANOTHER EAST EUROPEAN
BASKET CASE CAN ANYONE GUESS WHICH COUNTRY THAT IS THE ONE COUNTRY
IN EUROPE IN NATO WHICH ACTUALLY MEETS THE RULES
CORRECT VERY GOOD
YOU WIN A
PRIZE
NOW IF WE DON'T
BERLUSCONI WHO IF HE WAS AN EAST EUROPEAN LEADER EVERYBODY WOULD BE SAYING OF COURSE THAT'S SO EAST EUROPEAN THIS OVERLAP BETWEEN POLITICS AND BUSINESS AND THIS GUY WHO RUNS A MEDIA EMPIRE HE'S VERY CORRUPT HE'S IN WITH ORGANIZED CRIME YOU KNOW BERLUSCONI WOULD MAKE A PERFECT CARTOON CHARACTER AS AN EAST EUROPEAN LEADER BUT ACTUALLY HE'S THE PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LIKE SLOVENIA WHICH RICHER THAN SOME COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE MORE IMPORTANT IS THE TRAJECTORY
ALL THE TEN
NEW MEMBERS OF THE EU OR NEW ISH SINCE IT'S NOT THAT NEW NOW
HAVE
DEFICITS THAT ARE FALLING AND ECONOMIES THAT ARE GROWING THERE'S NOT ONE OF THEM NOT EVEN HUNGARY IS IN THE SAME BASKET CASE
SPAIN HAS A BIG ROMA POPULATION DONE PRETTY WELL WITH IT TURKEY BIG ROMA
FROM WHEN I WAS A STUDENT HERE 25 YEARS AGO THE TRAFFIC'S CHANGED AS WELL
SO YOU HAVE A VERY BIG TRANSFER FROM WEST TO EAST BUT THOSE SUMS ARE DWARFED BY THE SIZE OF THE BAILOUT
YOU KNOW IN ONE EU SUMMIT MEETING THEY SORT OF THINK OH WELL 100 BILLION MAY BE NOT ENOUGH 200 BILLION 300 BILLION MAKE IT HALF A TRILLION THAT
AGAIN THIS IS NOT ROMA IS A TERRIBLE EUROPEAN SOCIAL PROBLEM VERY BAD EDUCATION VERY BAD HOUSING LOTS OF DISCRIMINATION LOTS OF CRIMINALITY VERY HIGH BIRTH RATE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM PARTICULARLY I THINK FOR OUR CHILDREN GOING
FREE TRADING AND DISTINCTLY OPEN AND NOWADAYS THEY'RE ALL PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIA AND IT'S MAJOR PART OF NATO'S THINKING ITS THINKING ABOUT BALTIC SECURITY IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY INVOLVES SUPPOSEDLY NON NATO SWEDEN AND FINLAND SO I THINK BALTIC EUROPE KIND OF MAKES
AUSTRIA SWITZERLAND SLOVENIA THE CZECH REPUBLIC
AND SLOVAKIA
AND
THOSE ARE COUNTRIES WHICH ALL HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON
THEY ARE
STABLE POLITICALLY
NO WORRIES ABOUT WEIRD EXTREMIST PARTIES WE HAVE THOSE WORRIES A BIT FURTHER EAST A BIT FURTHER SOUTH AND A BIT FURTHER WEST BUT IN THAT
CORE CHUNK OF EUROPE YOU HAVE BASICALLY STABLE POLITICS YOU HAVE STRONG ECONOMIES NO ONE ANYWHERE NEAR A BAILOUT NO ONE'S WORRIED ABOUT CREDIT RATINGS THE CREDIT RATINGS ARE GOING UP
IT'S ABOUT INTEGRATION EASTERN EUROPE IS INTEGRATED INTO WESTERN EUROPE TO THE POINT WHERE THE CONCEPT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANY MORE
LOOK AT NATO YOU HAVE SO CALLED WEST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LIKE IRELAND SWITZERLAND
AUSTRIA FINLAND SWEDEN WHICH ARE NOT IN NATO YOU'VE GOT ALL THE EU10 IN NATO AND COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EU10 WHICH ARE TRYING TO JOIN SO
TO BUILD NEW ROADS THE NEW BRIDGE WHICH I CAME ACROSS TODAY IN CRACOW VERY NICE
DAMAGING DISPARAGING IRRELEVANT CONCEPTUALLY FLAWED IDEA OF EASTERN EUROPE IN THE DUSTBIN LET'S DEAL WITH THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AS THEY ARE AND IF WE MAKE CATEGORIES MAKE THEM REAL ONES WITH REAL COMMON CHARACTERISTICS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHICH IS NOT REALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE EUROPEAN MAINSTREAM COUNTRIES WHICH ARE A BIT WEIRD A BIT DIFFERENT IT'S EASTERN EUROPE IT'S ALMOST USED AS A TERM OF ABUSE THE FOOD WAS REALLY BAD IT WAS LIKE EAST EUROPEAN THIS INCIDENTALLY
ARE EITHER STABLE OR IMPROVING AND SOME OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY EAST EUROPEAN BASKET CASES NOW HAVE MUCH STRONGER CREDIT RATINGS THAN EVEN THE REALLY
OF EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND IT EXCLUDES COUNTRIES LIKE BRITAIN WHICH ARE NOT IN SCHENGEN SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE EURO YOU'VE
RULE SO EVEN THEN IT WAS A PRETTY UNTIDY CONCEPT BUT IT SORT OF MADE SENSE WESTERN EUROPE BASICALLY FREE EASTERN EUROPE BASICALLY NOT BUT SINCE THE FALL OF THE IRON CURTAIN THIS TERM HAS STAYED IT'S BECOME A KIND OF
AND WE LOVE IT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS AWESOME RIGHT
PEOPLE OUT THERE TOO WHO HAVE SKIPPED PAST COLLEGE FOR EXAMPLE BILL GATES
THAN ONE QUARTER OF THEM ACTUALLY LOOKED FOR A SPECIFIC COLLEGE
DIDN'T HAVE A REAL JOB OR HAVE BEEN TOLD TO GET REAL JOB OR HAD DECIDED THEY
BLOG POSTS PODCASTS ALL MADE BY PEOPLE WHO
AS LONG AS IT'S ONE OF THESE 3 OR 4 SPECIFIC PROFESSIONS RIGHT SO
AND AT THIS POINT SOME OF US START TO QUESTION RIGHT
AND WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THAT IS THOSE AUTHORS HAD JOB TITLES
BUT NOT EVERYONE AND CERTAINLY NOT YOU RIGHT
CHILDREN WE NATURALLY HAVE THAT AND THAT'S WHY YOU ASK
ONES IRRELEVANT IF YOU GET PAID WELL ENOUGH ANY JOB IS A REAL JOB
BEEN IN THIS SITUATION MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE SO IF GOOGLE DOESN'T KNOW THE ANSWER
AND TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR PASSION IS BUT IT'S BECOME
MORE MONEY AND MORE HOUSES THAN I WILL EVER SEE IN MY LIFE
SO IF YOU CHOOSE THE MAJOR THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT LEAD TO A
ZUCKERBERG TECH GIANTS WHO HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY GRADUATED OR CELEBRITIES LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT WHO IS ABOUT MY AGE
THE SKILLS TO DO THE JOB
WE'VE BEEN MADE A LOT OF
IT'S REAL OR ABOUT WHETHER IT EXISTS OR ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GOOD AT IT WALT DISNEY WAS FIRED FROM HIS FIRST JOB AT A NEWSPAPER BECAUSE HE LACKED IMAGINATION
PRACTICE IT BECOMES EASIER AND IF YOU
EXAMPLE TO BE A NURSE YOU DO NEED TO GO TO A NURSING SCHOOL BUT YOU DON'T
TURN OFF THE INTERNET GET AWAY FROM FRIENDS OR ROOMMATES ANY OTHER VOICES THAT ARE
TO START A COMPANY OR A BUSINESS
WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO WHEN THEY GROW UP YOU WILL GET A CREATIVE AND
PICK THE WRONG MAJOR YOU'RE DOOMED TO A LIFE OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT AND JOBS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE A DEGREE ANYWAY AND
AND TO REALLY EXPLORE OPTIONS THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE THIS
PATH RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GONNA CONNECT WITH
NAMES THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT ON OUR WORLD AND IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE THEY DID NOT GET WHERE THEY ARE BY LISTENING TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TOLD THEM THEY SHOULD BE
JUST TO GO TO COLLEGE SO THEY KEEP ADDING ON RIGHT THE ECONOMY IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE AND WE'VE BECOME REALLY SCARED IT'S NOT ENOUGH ANYMORE TO GET A COLLEGE
BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE AS LONG AS IT'S A
YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO GET IT AND WHEN YOU ASK
WHAT TRULY MAKES YOU PASSIONATE AND EXCITED IT'S PRACTICING LISTENING TO YOUR OWN VOICE
DEVICE YOU PRESS A BUTTON
IT CALLS THE SECRETARY
AND IF SHE KNOWS YOU SHE WOULD PRESS 8
ON HER TELEPHONE AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN
WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
IS THAT EACH ONE OF YOU CAN OPEN THIS DOOR IN FIVE SECONDS BY PLAYING THE SOUND 8
ON YOUR CELL PHONE JUST NEXT TO THE INTERCOM
SCIENTISTS AND PARTICIPANTS AND WHEN WE HAVE TRUST WE CAN DO GREAT THINGS
DO THESE TESTS JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR ANCESTRY THEY WANT TO FIND THEIR RELATIVES OR MAYBE MEET THE BLACK SHEEP IN THEIR FAMILY
BY THIS POINT WE EXHAUSTED ALL THE DEMOGRAPHIC IDENTIFIERS WE STILL HAD 20000 PEOPLE AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO IS THE PERSON WE WERE STUCK
SHARING AND PRIVACY I REALIZE THAT IN MANY CASES WHEN PEOPLE SAY I WANT MY PRIVACY IN MANY CASES THEY TELL US I DON'T TRUST YOU WITH MY DATA
ARE GOING TO COLLECT BLOOD FROM THIS NEWBORN AND ANALYZE HIS DNA IMMEDIATELY TO KNOW ALL THE PREDISPOSITIONS IN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE
THE Y CHROMOSOME OF THIS INDIVIDUAL AND SEARCHED THIS DATABASE AND EVENTUALLY WE FOUND A MATCH TO ANOTHER Y CHROMOSOME SINCE THESE TWO Y CHROMOSOMES WERE IDENTICAL WE ALSO KNEW THAT THE SURNAMES SHOULD MATCH EACH OTHER SO NOW WE ARE ABLE TO INFER THE SURNAME
DO IT FOR EVERY GENOME AND THEN PEOPLE FEEL THAT WE RECIPROCATE WE GIVE THEM SOMETHING BACK AND THIS CREATES THESE
WERE ABLE TO BREACH THE PRIVACY OF CLOSE TO 50 DIFFERENT PARTICIPANTS WE HAD THEIR ENTIRE GENOME AND FULL NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION
WE REDUCED THE SEARCH SPACE FROM 20000 INDIVIDUALS ALL THE WAY TO
WITHOUT BIOBANKS WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HELP ARIELA THE WHOLE PROCESS
A HACKER I WONDERED IF THIS SECURITY MECHANISM IS GOOD
AND I WANTED TO TRY TO HACK IT AND TO SEE IF I CAN BREACH THE PRIVACY OF THESE PARTICIPANTS
SO MY LAB CONDUCTED AN EMPIRICAL TEST
WE TOOK A DNA SAMPLE FROM A US BIOBANK
NOW SINCE THIS PERSON COULD MATCH
AND WHEN THEY'RE SICK WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE BEST CLINICAL CARE THAT IS AVAILABLE WITH GENOMICS WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE BLUEPRINTS OF DIFFERENT HUMAN MALADIES WE CAN DEVELOP BETTER TREATMENTS AND WE CAN REALLY OPEN A NEW CHAPTER IN BIOMEDICAL
MEASURES TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY AND THE PRIVACY OF THEIR PARTICIPANTS WHEN SCIENTISTS ACCESS THE DNA IN THESE BIOBANKS THEY DON'T GET THE NAME OR CONTACT INFORMATION OF THESE PEOPLE
THEY ONLY GET ACCESS TO THE DNA WITH SOME BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SUCH AS
EVERY MONTH OR 100 GENOMES EVERY DAY AND WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TRUST RELATIONSHIPS HOW DO WE GET TO THESE TRUST
I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT I WORKED AS HACKER IN A COMPUTER SECURITY FIRM WE USED TO BE HIRED BY BANKS AND CREDIT CARD SERVICES TO
GENOME I WANT TO ALSO SHOW THEM MY OWN TEST RESULTS AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EACH ONE OF YOU TO CONSIDER SHARING YOUR GENOMIC INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATE IN SUCH
INFORMATION WHERE HE LIVES ALL OF THESE WERE CONNECTED WITH HIS GENOMIC INFORMATION WITH ALL THE
HEART DISEASE CANCER OR PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESSES
ONCE WE KNOW THE GENETIC BASIS WE CAN NOW OFFER HELP FOR PATIENTS WE CAN OFFER THEM EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION
TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT THIS PROCESS MIGHT LOOK LIKE I WANT TO SHOW YOU A SHORT SCENE
IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH FOR FAMILIES LIKE ARIELA'S BUT ALSO FOR OTHER TYPES OF DISEASES
WE SEQUENCED ARIELA'S GENOME AND WERE ABLE TO PINPOINT THE MUTATION THAT CAUSED THIS FACIAL MALFORMATION AND QUITE LIKELY ALSO INDUCED HER CANCER
WITH THIS INFORMATION AND ALSO WE CAN GO AND TELL THEM WHAT WE DO WITH THEIR DATA AND THIS IS PART BASICALLY WHERE WE GO TO THIS WEBSITE
TO WORK WITH DEMOGRAPHIC IDENTIFIERS TO NARROW DOWN THE SEARCH SPACE WE KNEW THAT THE SAMPLE CAME
WE DON'T HAVE BANKS BUT I FOUND THAT WE HAVE BIOBANKS THESE REGISTRIES COLLECT AND STORE THE DNA OF MANY INDIVIDUALS TO GIVE ACCESS TO
THE CEILING
THIS IS SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT
DEFORESTATION IS THE OPPOSITE OF THIS
DEFORESTATION IS ABOUT DESTROYING TREES
ABOUT DESTROYING FORESTS
AND ABOUT DESTROYING BIODIVERSITY
MY IDEA'S A SIMPLE ONE
IT'S ABOUT PLANTING FORESTS
TO MOUTH EXISTENCE FISHING ESPECIALLY WITH DECLINING FISHING STOCKS
ARE CLEARING THE FORESTS OF WEST SULAWESI AT AROUND
THING WAS HAPPENING FURTHER UP THE SLOPE
ACROSS THE VALLEY OVER THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE
ON THE NEXT ISLAND
HUNDREDS OF SMALL CLEARINGS
THOUSANDS OF FIRES
AND MILLION OF HECTARES OF FORESTS LOST
IT ALSO MEANS THAT NEXT YEAR
WE'LL BE ABLE TO START
A PILOT PROJECT THAT WILL SEE TREES PUT BACK IN THE LANDSCAPE OF WEST SULAWESI FOR THE FIRST TIME
WE'RE PERSISTENT
I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO A PLACE WHERE TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND SMALL FARMERS COLLIDE IT'S IN SULAWESI AND MOST OF YOU WILL KNOW BEING IN DARWIN THAT SULAWESI IS NOT VERY FAR FROM
PER ANNUM YOU SAY OH 5 PERCENT THAT'S NOT MUCH
FOREST LANDSCAPES BY PLANTING NEWLY
PLANTED FORESTS
THOSE NEWLY PLANTED FORESTS PROVIDE TIMBER FOR THE NEW TIMBER INDUSTRIES AND THEY PROVIDE RENEWABLE
ENERGY THE RENEWABLE ENERGY IS AN ENABLING
DEVELOPMENT IT ENABLES VALUATING IT ENABLES THE TIMBER INDUSTRY TO GET GOING BUT IT ALSO ENABLES
LEVELS OF INVESTMENT
TO MAKE A CHANGE TO BREAK THE DINDIN PARADOX
THE FIRST IS
PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT
TO
CREATE THE PLANTED FORESTS AND AS I SAID THE PLANTED FORESTS
WILL PHYSICALLY PROTECT
THE REMAINING FOREST THEY PROVIDE NEW TIMBER FOR NEW TIMBER INDUSTRIES AND RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY AND THE PUBLIC SIDE OF THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
FACED WITH DINDIN'S DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULD YOU FIND IT ACCEPTABLE JUST TO CUT DOWN A FEW SMALL TREES JUST SO YOU COULD
GROW SOME CROPS SO YOU COULD FEED YOUR FAMILY
THAT SOUNDS ACCEPTABLE
THIS IS
SUSTAINABLE FORESTS
AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURES
IT'S ABOUT FORESTS IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE FOREST FROM DEFORESTATION IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
MOST IMPORTANTLY
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAUSE THE DEFORESTATION
IT'S ABOUT EMPLOYING PEOPLE GIVING THEM A FUTURE GIVING THEM MEANINGFUL JOBS IN
SUSTAINABLE FORESTS
AND IT'S ABOUT CARBON
BECAUSE ONCE THE WORLD
SORTS ITSELF OUT AND ESTABLISHES A VIABLE AND RELIABLE CARBON TRADING SYSTEM
THEN
THE DEBRIS WAS ON THE GROUND HE'S LIT A COUPLE OF SMALL FIRES THESE ARE NOT GREAT CONFLAGRATIONS THESE ARE SMALL SMOKY FIRES THAT CREEP THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE
JUST LIKE DINDIN THESE SAPLINGS WERE GROWING
LOOKING FOR SPACE GROWING FOR SUNLIGHT AND WATER AND GROWING SPACE
SO DINDIN MADE A START AND HE CUT DOWN THOSE SAPLINGS BUILT HIMSELF A SMALL
DWELLING BUILT HIMSELF A PLATFORM
TO SLEEP ON AND SET ABOUT CLEARING
TIDING UP
THE REST OF THE CLEARING
STANDING ON THE MDF THAT'S IN YOUR LITTLE TABLES AND THE POLES THAT ARE
THE
TREES ARE BEING CUT DOWN WE REPLANT
THEM IF THE PEOPLE CUTTING DOWN THE TREES ARE CUTTING DOWN FOR ECONOMIC REASONS WE
PAY THEM
TO REPLANT THEM
AND THOSE TREES THE TREES THAT PLANTED
THEN PROVIDE PROTECTION
AGAINST DEFORESTATION OF THE REMAINING FOREST THEY PROVIDE TIMBER FOR A REJUVENATED TIMBER
DEFORESTATION IS CAUSING THE LOSS OF TROPICAL FORESTS UNIQUE TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS AND UNIQUE TROPICAL BIODIVERSITY
UNSURPRISINGLY IS WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE GIVE UP
WALK AWAY
BUT IF YOU PERSIST
IF YOU
BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
IF YOU BECOME PART OF THE LANDSCAPE
IF YOU BECOME PART OF THE FURNITURE
THEN CONFIDENCE IS BUILT
RE BUILT
AND
GAME CHANGING INNOVATION FOR THE PROVINCE AND THIS IS THE ONE INNOVATION THAT'S CARRYING THE PROJECT TOGETHER WITH
AND
TO GET TO THIS POINT IT'S BEEN ABOUT MANAGING EXPECTATION AND
THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO THIS PROJECT
THIS WILL
RESONATE WITH MANY OF YOU WHO'RE INVOLVED IN PROJECTS OR ANY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
YOU START OFF WITH A GOOD IDEA
CREEPING THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE THEY KILL THE YOUNG RAINFOREST GERMINATING SHOOTS
RAINFOREST SEEDS ARE VERY VULNERABLE NOT LIKE EUCALYPTUS THEY BURN AND DIE VERY EASILY
AND
THESE FIRES
CHANGED THEY CONVERTED
THE FOREST DEBRIS INTO ASH
NOW THAT ASH IS THEN THE ESSENTIAL FERTILIZER FOR DINDIN'S FOOD GARDEN
AND WITH TIMBER CERTIFICATION
PRODUCT LABELING
AND
CHAIN OF CUSTODY
WE'RE CONSTRICTING
THE TIMBER PRODUCT'S MARKET SUCH THAT
IT'S BECOMING IMPOSSIBLE FOR ILLEGALLY HARVEST TIMBER TO
BE SOLD AND PROCESSED
SO
SOCIETY IS MAKING DIFFERENCE AND
THEM WE CAN TELL WHETHER YOU'RE MALE OR FEMALE WITH 93 ACCURACY WE CAN TELL YOUR AGE WITHIN FIVE YEARS AND WE CAN PROFILE YOUR PERSONALITY AND YOUR HEALTH BEHAVIORS
BUT THE WORDS ALSO KNOW ABOUT YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
AND
THOSE ARE TREMENDOUSLY INFLUENTIAL THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU AFFECT YOUR MENTAL AND YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH AND THOSE ARE HIGHLY CONNECTED
CORRELATE THE WORDS WITH AGE SEX PERSONALITY HEALTH TO SEE WHAT WE CAN LEARN ABOUT THEM
THE WORDS AND GRABBED FROM THE CENTRES FOR DISEASE CONTROL MORTALITY FROM ARTHEREOSCLEROTIC HEART DISEASE SO WHAT FRACTION OF THE POPULATION IN
INTROVERT FEATURES APPARENTLY WORDS OF A LITTLE MORE COMPLEXITY AND THINKING
NOT MUCH DEPRESSION JUST A LITTLE BIT
SO THAT'S EXTROVERSION INTROVERSION I WANT TO SHOW YOU NOW ONE MORE PAIR NEUROTICISM
VOLUNTEERS ALSO TOOK A DETAILED PERSONALITY QUESTIONNAIRE THE FIVE FACTOR MODEL AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE WORDS OF DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES SO LET'S START WITH HIGH EXTROVERSION THESE ARE CONTROLLED FOR MALE AND FEMALE BALANCE WHAT DO
FOR YOU GUYS GO BUY A FRIEND A PRESENT AND COME BACK IN 3 HOURS WHO'S HAPPIER AFTER 3 HOURS THE ONES WHO BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR THEIR FRIENDS GIVING MONEY AWAY IS ACTUALLY
THAT TWEETS AT A COUNTY LEVEL GIVE INSIGHT INTO THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF THAT COUNTY
THEM SO FOR THE SECOND SET OF RESULTS WE COLLECTED A BILLION TWEETS WE MAPPED MANY OF THEM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL TO SEE WHERE THEY CAME FROM WE CORRELATED THAT THEN WITH DATA FROM THE CENTRES FOR DISEASE
AND A POSITIVE SENTIMENT WE CAN GET A BETTER PICTURE BY LOOKING AT THE TOPICS THESE CLUSTERS OF WORDS TO SEE WHICH TOPIC CLUSTERS MOST CORRELATE WITH LOWER HEART DISEASE ON THE TOP IN GREEN OR
THAT LEADS TO THE SECOND HALF OF MY TALK WHICH IS TO NOTE THAT COUNTIES COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS CHURCHES ALL HAVE PERSONALITIES TOO AND THOSE PERSONALITIES HAVE A HUGE INFLUENCE ON THE PEOPLE THAT
IN MUCH MORE SPORTS THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT RELIGION YOU CAN SEE THE LORD AND CHURCH AND BLESSED AND PROVERBS POSITIVE CORRELATES OF LOW NEUROTIC PEOPLE WELL THIS
AVERAGE COUNTIES THAT TALK MORE ABOUT GIVING MONEY ARE HAPPIER COUNTIES
AND YOU CAN SEE THE SOUL AND I MISS AND PROUD OF BUT BEFORE YOU GET UPSET ABOUT MY CLICHENESS ABOUT FEMALES IF THIS IS WHAT GIRLS LOOK
BEING BLACK IS UNFORTUNATELY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH HEART DISEASE IN THE US BEING FAT
LET'S START WITH SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY CLEAR AND LET'S SEE IF IT MAKES SENSE SEE THE WORDS THAT ARE MOST TYPICAL MOST DISCRIMINATIVE MOST PREDICTIVE OF
IF YOU LIVE IN A COMMUNITY THAT COMMUNITY HAS A PERSONALITY PROFILE
TOOLS START TO OFFER THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE AN
WHICH IS YOUR PHONE YOUR PHONE KNOWS THE WORDS THAT YOU SAY AND
THE PERSONALITY OF YOUR COMMUNITY AFFECTS YOUR LONGEVITY NOT JUST YOUR HAPPINESS BUT YOUR HEALTH
WELL HOW BIG IS THIS EFFECT
WELL WE HAVE LOT OF DEMOGRAPHICS FOR THESE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND WE KNOW WHAT THE NORMAL CORRELATES ARE THE
DROP OUT AND RELAPSE BUT MONITORING WORDS IS NOT JUST FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEPRESSED OR ADDICTED
LEVEL MODEL ABOUT PEOPLE
BUT DO THESE
PERSONALITY TRAITS HAVE BROADER CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF CHARACTERIZING WHOLE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE
THE COMMUNITIES I'LL TALK ABOUT TODAY ARE GOING TO BE US COUNTIES
I'M SHOWING AT THE TOP HERE THE EXACT SAME SLIDE I SHOWED YOU OF WELL ADJUSTED
SO WE'VE LOOKED AT TWO LEVELS HERE
WHETHER YOU'RE DEPRESSED OR NOT AS ACCURATELY AS A TWO QUESTION SCREEN THAT WE USE IN THE HOSPITAL HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
WE CAN TELL A LOT THERE BUT WE ALSO KNOW LOT NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TWEETING OR TEXTING BUT ALSO WHAT YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOING WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY IS TELLING THERE AND COMMUNITIES ARE TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT STUDY AFTER STUDY IS SUGGESTING THAT
EVERYTHING IS CONTAGIOUS NOT JUST HAPPINESS OR SMOKING BUT OBESITY
WHAT'S THE VECTOR HOW ARE THESE THINGS TRANSMITTED
IT'S TRANSMITTED BY WORDS AND THOSE WORDS ARE IN FACT CAPTURED BY YOUR PHONE NOT JUST YOUR TEXTS AND TWEETS BUT INCREASINGLY YOUR SPOKEN WORDS AS WELL
THIS
TWO SETS OF STUDIES IN THE FIRST WE'LL LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL LEVEL MODELING FROM FACEBOOK TO SHOW WHAT
THIS CORRESPONDS TO INDIVIDUAL LEVEL RESULTS THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE HAVE DONE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT YOU ALL HERE'S TEN BUCKS GO BUY YOURSELF A NICE PRESENT A LITTLE ONE AND COME BACK IN 3 HOURS HERE'S
ON MONITOR PROFILING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHAT YOU'RE READING
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING
THE QUESTION THEN
YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE CHOICE AT LEAST I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE THE CHOICE
AS TO WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE MONITORED WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE RECORDED OR NOT RECORDED AND YOUR CONVERSATIONS ANALYZED
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT HOW YOUR WORDS AFFECT YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT HOW
HOW RICH OR POOR ARE YOU
IT ALSO CAPTURES THOUGH THE MOOD AND PERSONALITY HOW ANGRY HOW POSITIVE HOW WELL ADJUSTED
IS YOUR COMMUNITY
SO THE WORDS OF YOUR COMMUNITY HAVE
A BIG
IMPACT ON YOU THE WORDS THAT YOU HEAR AND SEE AROUND YOU
SHAPE
HOW WELL YOU THRIVE BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY
AND POSSIBILITIES FANTASTIC WEEKENDS WHAT DO YOU NOT WANT YOUR NEIGHBOURS TO BE TWEETING ABOUT BULLSHIT
TRUE BY THE WAY ONLY FOR THE WEALTHIER COUNTIES IF YOU'RE POOR DONATION IS NOT AS VALUABLE BUT IF YOU'RE WEALTHIER
WELL THAT'S THE THESIS LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OTHER FORM OF RESPONSE
I'VE SHOWN YOU THE FEMALE SLIDE BUT SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF FEMALE WORDS TO GROUP THEM INTO TOPICS
SO WE'VE CLUSTERED WORDS THAT TEND TO SHOW UP TOGETHER WHICH TEND TO HAVE SIMILAR MEANINGS IN THE CLUSTERS AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE FEMALE WORDS INCLUDE EXCITEMENT
CUTENESS HAPPY BIRTHDAY WISHES FAMILY SO YOU CAN SEE THE TOPICS OFTEN GIVE
WHO ARE HAPPY AND IN GOOD RELATIONSHIPS ON AVERAGE LIVE FIVE YEARS LONGER THAT'S COMPARABLE TO NOT SMOKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE
A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR BUILDING MONITORS BASED ON PHONES
TO LOOK AT THE WORDS PEOPLE USE WE'RE GOING NOW INTO PREGNANCY CLINICS TO HELP PREGNANT WOMEN
WITH THEIR CHOICE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE MONITORED FOR DEPRESSION A RISK FACTOR IN PREGNANCY WE'RE GOING INTO OPIOID TREATMENT CLINICS WITH PEOPLE'S PERMISSION MONITORING TO SEE WHAT TRIGGERS WHAT DRIVES THEM TO EITHER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE TREATMENT
BY HIGHLY QUALIFIED BOARD CERTIFIED VETERINARIANS WHO TAKE OUTSTANDING CARE OF THEIR ANIMAL PATIENTS BUT OCCASIONALLY
THEIR ANIMAL PATIENTS AND OCCASIONALLY ON THE VERY SAME DAY I WENT ON ROUNDS AT UCLA MEDICAL CENTER AND AT THE LOS ANGELES ZOO
IN A BRIDE
WHO'D BEEN LEFT AT THE ALTER
BUT IT TURNS OUT THIS NEW HUMAN DIAGNOSIS
WAS NEITHER NEW
NOR WAS IT UNIQUELY HUMAN
VETERINARIANS
HAD
SO I STARTED WONDERING WITH ALL OF THESE OVERLAPS HOW WAS IT THAT I HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO ASK A VETERINARIAN OR CONSULT THE VETERINARY LITERATURE FOR
COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AS AN UNDERGRAD I HAD EVEN WRITTEN MY SENIOR THESIS ON DARWINIAN THEORY
INDUCED HEART FAILURE AROUND THE YEAR 2000 HUMAN CARDIOLOGISTS DISCOVERED EMOTIONALLY
CAN HELP US BETTER TAKE CARE OF A DANCE INSTRUCTOR WITH PAINFUL PERIODS AND HOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE TREATMENT OF SEPARATION ANXIETY IN A HIGH STRUNG SHELTIE
OF THE TIME
I WAS WORKING AT UCLA MEDICAL CENTER WITH PHYSICIANS DISCUSSING SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES AND TREATMENTS
FOR MY HUMAN PATIENTS
BUT SOME OF THE TIME
ASKED EVER ATTENDED A VETERINARY CONFERENCE
PATIENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN OCEANS AND FARMS AND JUNGLES
MONKEYS TO FLAMINGOS FROM TO DEER TO RABBITS
SINCE THE 1970S
HOW MANY HUMAN LIVES MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED IF THIS VETERINARY KNOWLEDGE HAD BEEN PUT INTO THE HANDS OF E R DOCS
THE NONURBAN
YOU KNOW WE HEAR ABOUT THESE CITY KIDS WHO THINK THAT WOOL GROWS ON TREES
OR THAT CHEESE COMES FROM A PLANT
WELL TODAY'S HUMAN HOSPITALS INCREASINGLY
ARE TURNING INTO THESE GLEAMING CATHEDRALS OF TECHNOLOGY
SOME BIOLOGICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS EVERY MEDICATION THAT WE PRESCRIBE OR THAT WE'VE TAKEN OURSELVES OR WE'VE GIVEN TO OUR FAMILIES
FEEL THAT TUG OF HUMAN EXCEPTIONALISM EVEN AS I RECOGNIZE THE SCIENTIFICALLY ISOLATING COST OF SEEING OURSELVES AS A SUPERIOR SPECIES APART
ALS BREAST CANCER EVEN PSYCHIATRIC SYNDROMES LIKE DEPRESSION
THEIR NEWBORN AND IN SOME EXTREME CASES
EVEN HARM THE CHILD
EQUINE VETERINARIANS ALSO KNOW THAT OCCASIONALLY A MARE SOON AFTER GIVING BIRTH
WILL NEGLECT THE FOAL
REFUSING TO NURSE AND IN SOME INSTANCES
KICK THE FOAL EVEN TO DEATH
BUT VETERINARIANS HAVE
DISCUSSIONS OF THE SHARED DISEASES AND DISORDERS OF ANIMAL AND HUMAN PATIENTS AT ZOOBIQUITY CONFERENCES PARTICIPANTS LEARN
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE BRAIN TUMORS LEUKEMIA
THE DOOR AND COME TOGETHER AS COLLEAGUES AS PEERS AS DOCTORS
AND VETERINARIANS CHECK THEIR ATTITUDES AND THEIR
TREATING AND EVEN PREVENTING EMOTIONALLY INDUCED SYMPTOMS IN ANIMALS
WHAT DO YOU CALL A VETERINARIAN WHO CAN ONLY TAKE CARE OF ONE SPECIES
AN ELDERLY FEMALE CHIMPANZEE HAD WOKEN UP WITH A FACIAL DROOP
AND THE VETERINARIANS WERE WORRIED THAT SHE'D HAD A STROKE
THEY ASKED IF I'D COME TO THE ZOO
AND IMAGE THE ANIMAL'S HEART TO LOOK FOR A POSSIBLE CARDIAC
VETERINARIANS HAVE VERY SPECIFIC
AND VERY EFFECTIVE WAYS OF TREATING AND EVEN PREVENTING SELF INJURY IN THEIR SELF INJURING ANIMALS
SHOULDN'T THIS VETERINARY KNOWLEDGE BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF
AND BIRDS SO I DON'T BLAME THE VETS FOR FEELING ANNOYED BY MY PROFESSION'S CONDESCENSION AND
DEVELOPING CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE OR DIABETES OR BREAST CANCER ON THEIR OWN
TO EMBRACE OUR PATIENTS' AND OUR OWN ANIMAL NATURES AND JOIN VETERINARIANS IN A SPECIES SPANNING
MOST HUMANISTIC MEDICINE IS BEING PRACTICED BY DOCTORS WHOSE PATIENTS AREN'T
EXPLAIN IT I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO AIR SOME DIRTY LAUNDRY SOME PHYSICIANS CAN BE REAL SNOBS ABOUT DOCTORS WHO ARE NOT M D
AND PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT MAYBE ESPECIALLY ANIMAL DOCTORS
AND PHYSICIANS WHERE WE DRAINED 700 CC'S OF FLUID FROM THE SAC IN WHICH THIS LION'S HEART WAS CONTAINED AND THIS
I BE TAKING BETTER CARE
OF MY HUMAN PATIENT
IF I SAW THEM
AS A HUMAN
ANIMAL PATIENT
HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF EXCITING CONNECTIONS
BUT I THINK THERE'S AN EVEN DEEPER REASON
PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS WE ACCEPT INTELLECTUALLY THAT OUR SPECIES HOMO SAPIENS IS MERELY ONE SPECIES NO MORE UNIQUE
OR SPECIAL THAN ANY OTHER
BUT IN OUR HEARTS
WE DON'T COMPLETELY BELIEVE THAT
I FEEL IT MYSELF WHEN I'M LISTENING TO MOZART
OR LOOKING AT PICTURES OF THE MARS ROVER ON MY MACBOOK
ANIMAL EXPERTS AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS AND EMBEDDING THEM ON OUR MEDICAL TEAMS WITH OUR INTERNS AND OUR RESIDENTS
IN HER FOAL SHOULDN'T THIS INFORMATION BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF OB GYN'S AND FAMILY DOCTORS AND PATIENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
BY PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO HOW ALL THE OTHER PATIENTS ON THE PLANET LIVE GROW GET SICK AND HEAL
SOME PLUCK OUT PATCHES OF HAIR OTHERS ACTUALLY CUT THEMSELVES SOME ANIMAL PATIENTS ALSO HARM THEMSELVES THERE ARE BIRDS THAT
WHAT DO THE ANIMAL DOCTORS KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THAT I DON'T KNOW AND
NOW I'VE GOT A CONFESSION TO MAKE EVEN THOUGH
AND I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY PHYSICIANS WHO WAS INVITED IN TO
THAN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THAT WHEN WE GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL WE LEARN EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT ONE SPECIES HOMO SAPIENS BUT
BEFORE I GOT MAX I FELT NERVOUS I NEVER HAD A PET BEFORE WOULD IT BITE WOULD IT BE SCARY I
WRITING MY OWN BOOK ABOUT MY OWN GECKO I HAVE A GECKO NAMED MAX AT
HIM I ALSO MIST HIS HOME EVERYDAY A LITTLE IN THE MORNING AND A LOT AT NIGHT I LOVE MY GECKO AS MUCH AS AN AUTHOR WOULD LOVE HIS OWN BOOKS I LOVE MY GECKO SO
OF THEM ARE GENTLE AND HARMLESS PETS TO HUMANS I THOUGHT I COULD ENJOY QUITE A LONG TIME WITH MY PET LIZARD BUT MY MOM SAID IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY I PROMISED THAT I WOULD TAKE A REALLY GOOD CARE FOR HIM
I HAVE A GECKO WHO LOOKS AT RAIN AND THE SOUND OF THE RAIN DROPS HIM WHEN THEY LAND ON YOUR UMBRELLA I HAVE A GECKO AS MY BEST FRIEND ALSO IF YOU'RE
LAST GECKO AND SAID NOW I DEFINITELY WANT THIS ONE THE DAY WE BROUGHT HIM HOME WAS THE BEST DAY
TO ASK YOU A LITTLE QUESTION DO YOU LIKE ANIMALS IF YOU DO YOU WILL LIKE THIS SPEECH WAIT FOR IT WAIT
A BIG DIFFERENCE IN YOU AND BY THE WAY REMEMBER TO SAY I LOVE ANIMALS EVERYDAY {NS}
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS I'VE FOUND IS THAT PET LIZARDS CAN LIVE UP TO 5 TO 15 YEARS
ASLEEP DREAMING ABOUT MAX EVER SINCE I GOT MAX I'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING HARD TO TAKE CARE OF HIM I HELP MY MOM WHEN SHE CLEANS HIS
AROUND ABOUT 93 BILLION ADD THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THIS IS ABOUT WHAT YOU GET WHAT WE SPEND ON LOOKING AFTER PATIENTS WITH CANCER IN THE WORLD 170
MAKING PROGRESS BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING ARE INCREMENTAL BENEFITS BY ALL MEANS MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN SURVIVAL FOR OUR PATIENTS SO THIS IS WHAT THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE IN
I'LL KEEP IT PRETTY SIMPLE STOP SMOKING EAT HEALTHILY EDUCATE AND VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN THANK YOU
THERE'S A WOMAN WHO HAS A BREAST COMPLETELY REPLACED WITH TUMOR
AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE'S A LADY THAT WE ARE TOO LATE TO HELP
HER BREAST IS ALSO REPLACED BY CANCER SHRUNKEN AND SMALL HER ABDOMEN IS SWOLLEN BECAUSE SHE HAS LIVER FAILURE FROM ADVANCED LIVER METASTASIS HER CANCER HAS SPREAD AND SHE NOW HAS TERMINAL BREAST CANCER
VERY OFTEN WE'RE DETECTING SOMETHING THAT A PATIENT CAN'T FEEL SHE'S HAVING A MAMMOGRAM AND WE'RE DETECTING AN ASYMPTOMATIC CANCER AT A STAGE WE'RE ABLE TO CURE BUT THIS IS HOW BREAST CANCER PRESENTS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
I'D LIKE TO FINISH WITH THE WORDS OF PAUL FARMER WHO SAID THAT THE IDEA THAT SOME LIVES MATTER LESS IS THE ROOT OF ALL THAT'S WRONG WITH THIS
AND THE ILLUSIVE MAGIC BULLET IS BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT TARGETS JUST THE CANCER CELLS AND IN SO DOING THE REST OF YOUR BODY YOUR HEALTHY CELLS AREN'T AFFECTED SO THE MAGIC BULLET KILLS THE CANCER AND LEAVES YOU UNAFFECTED WITHOUT ANY SIDE EFFECTS
BUT OF COURSE MAGIC BULLETS ARE REALLY HARD TO MAKE AND FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
SO
IS A SCORING SYSTEM CALLED THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX THAT'S USED TO RANK COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT LIFE EXPECTANCY EDUCATION AND GDP OF A COUNTRY
OURSELVES THE USA WE WOULD BE VERY HIGH HDI COUNTRIES
UP TO MORE THAN 50 THIS
IS WHEN THEY'RE DEVELOPING THE HABIT IT'LL BE VERY HARD TO STOP THEM FROM SMOKING IF THEY START IT AT 18 19 20 SO WE'VE GOT A LONG DISTANCE STILL TO COME
SMOKING IS LINKED TO MORE THAN 15 CANCERS AND SINGLE HANDEDLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FORMATION OF OVER 90 OF LUNG CANCERS IN MEN AND OVER 50 OF LUNG CANCERS IN WOMEN
BLOOD BORNE
TARGET THE GROUPS THAT NEED IT MOST THE SEX WORKERS HEALTH WORKERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO BLOOD PRODUCTS INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS TARGET THEM EDUCATE THEM GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO AVOID THE CANCERS TO GET VACCINATIONS THERE ARE GREAT VACCINATIONS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH HEPATITIS B AND ALSO HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS THAT KILLER OF WOMEN THAT CAUSE OF CERVICAL CANCER
WE'VE CHATTED ALREADY TODAY ABOUT HOW VERY DIFFICULT IT IS TO CHANGE BEHAVIORS WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE APPROACHES AND CULTURES AROUND ALCOHOL YES BANNING SPORTS ADVERTISING FOR ALCOHOL REDUCING
SUGAR IN DRINKS FOR OUR CHILDREN INCREASING THE TAX ON SUGARY DRINKS IT'S
GASTRIC CANCER
LIVER CANCER CAUSED BY HEPATITIS B AND C AND CERVICAL CANCER THE BIGGEST CANCER KILLER OF WOMEN IN ASIA AND IN CHINA CAUSED BY HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS A PREVENTABLE VIRUS A VIRUS THAT IS SPREAD BY SEXUAL CONTACT EVEN EDUCATION ALONE CAN IMPACT THE INSTANCE OF HPV AND THESE ARE THE CAUSES OF CANCER IN LOWER HDI COUNTRIES
A LATENCY BETWEEN THE TIME YOU PICK UP THE VIRUS AND THE TIME YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRONE TO DEVELOPING A CANCER OF ABOUT 30 TO 40 YEARS SO THESE ARE ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE
BUT IF SUCCESSFUL AND IF THE HPV VACCINATION PROGRAM IS USED CORRECTLY IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE INCIDENTS OF CERVICAL CANCER THAT HUGE KILLER OF WOMEN WORLDWIDE WILL BE REDUCED BY HALF WITHIN ABOUT 40 YEARS
ARE SURVIVING BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING TREATMENT FOR MALARIA FOR TB FOR HIV THE
UNDER FIVE MORTALITY RATE HAS ALMOST HALFED JUST SINCE 1990
AND BECAUSE OF THAT LIFE EXPECTANCY IS UP
WHILE THERE IS AN INCREASE ALL OVER THE WORLD INCLUDING DEVELOPING PARTS OF THE WORLD LIKE OUR OWN
WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE WORLD OVERALL IT'S A RESOUNDINGLY GOOD SUCCESS STORY THIS IS THE UNDER FIVE MORTALITY RATE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK SIMPLY BY HAPPY HAPPENSTANCE YOU'RE LIVING IN IRELAND SO YOU'LL PROBABLY SURVIVE YOUR CANCER ABOUT HOW MUCH DID WE SPEND ON THE RIO OLYMPICS THIS YEAR A
NOT ALL CHEAP BUT THEY CAN BE APPLIED THESE ARE THE TOP FIVE BEHAVIORS WE NEED TO CHANGE STOP SMOKING EDUCATE PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT HEPATITIS B AND C ARE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
WHY DOES IT COST SO MUCH WHERE IS ALL THIS MONEY GOING
WELL THE PHARMA COMPANIES WILL SAY MY SEXY DRUG WAS REALLY EXPENSIVE TO MAKE AND THAT'S TRUE ON AVERAGE YOUR NEWEST ONCOLOGY DRUGS TAKE ABOUT TEN YEARS TO DEVELOP AND ABOUT 2 6 BILLION TO
MAKE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY
DON'T KNOW WHAT BECAME OF EVELYN OR WHAT BEFELL EVELYN WE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN PARTNERS IN HEALTH IS A CHARITY FOUNDED BY A DOCTOR PAUL FARMER
BUT YOU'LL SEE ON THE LEFT THE BIG BAR LOOKING AT VIRUSES LIKE HEPATITIS B AND C CAUSING LIVER CANCERS HELICOBACTER PYLORI IT'S A LITTLE BUG ENDEMIC IN SOME AREAS THAT CAUSES STOMACH CANCER
THIS IS EVELYN EVELYN IS A PATIENT WE TREATED IN HAITI WITH CHEAP OLD CHEMOTHERAPY DRUGS AND THIS IS HOW WELL THEY WORKED YOU CAN SEE THE BEFORE
THE BAD NEWS IF YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH IT TURNS OUT YOU'LL GET CANCER CANCER IS A DISEASE OF THE AGING IF YOU'VE GOT CLEAN WATER YOU SURVIVED CHILD BIRTH AND YOU DIDN'T DIE OF TB YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GET CANCER
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE RESOURCES ARE NOT GOING TO WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF DEATHS ARE OCCURRING IT'S CALLED THE 5 80 PARADOX ONLY 5 OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING INTO ONCOLOGY ARE BEING SPENT IN THE PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE 80 OF THE PATIENTS ARE DYING
WHEN I TRIED YOGA I FELT AS IF SOMEBODY WAS PUTTING A NAIL INTO MY THROAT HERE AND IT WAS COMING OUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE SO I LEARNED TO COPE WITH THE PAIN BY WORKING MANY HOURS AND IGNORING WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE SO I COULDN'T FEEL
ABOUT A MOMENT AT WORK IN WHICH YOU FELT FULL OF LIFE
I WAS STUNNED
FIRST I REALIZED HOW MUCH LITTLE JOY I HAD IN MY LIFE
AND SECOND
I REALIZED THAT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS CHANGING ME THANKS TO SOMEBODY LISTENING TO ME
OUT FROM YOUR HOME THE GOOD OLD FRIEND AND LET ME ADD THE STAND GOOD OLD FRIEND YOU HAD LEFT HOME FOR HALF AN HOUR AND WITHIN THIS
2004 UNTIL 2015 THE RED IS THE AMOUNT OF SEARCHES FOR THE WORD TALKING AND THE BLUE IS FOR LISTENING
MAY TALK YOUR EAR OFF AND YOU SAY I CAN'T LISTEN TO THIS ANYMORE YOU WANT TO LEAVE THE ROOM OR WANT THEM TO
BEHAVIOR AND IN ONE TOP JOURNAL OUT OF 3000 PAPERS I FOUND ZERO
DISCUSSING LISTENING IN OTHER TOP JOURNAL OUT OF 4000 PAPERS TWO
DISCUSSED LISTENING
AND WHILE IT REFLECTS SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISINTEREST OF RESEARCHERS IN LISTENING
I THINK IT REFLECTS THE DISINTEREST OF HUMANS
IN LISTENING
WATCH WITH ME THIS GRAPH THIS
TO PEOPLE YOU MAY START TO HEAR HORRIBLE
GET ALONG I SEE THAT YOU REMEMBER THIS CASE SO DO ME ONE MORE LITTLE FAVOR WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
PREMATURE DEATH YOU MAY FEEL BURDENED THAT NOW YOU
TO THEIR TEACHERS THEIR STUDENTS HAVE BETTER GRADES IN SCHOOL AND FINALLY
EVERY DAY CHOOSE ONE TWO PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
PERSON WHO SHARED THE STORY BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT OFTEN WHAT THE OTHER PERSON WANTS IS NOTHING BUT YOUR LISTENING IF YOU LISTEN AND BELIEVE IT IS HELPFUL YOU WILL NOT HAVE SUCH BURDEN
THEM TO TELL STORIES
INSTEAD OF ASKING WHAT'S YOUR NAME COULD YOU TELL ME SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT YOUR NAME YOU
CAN ASK THESE PEOPLE AND IN GENERAL AFTER THEY SAY WHATEVER THEY SAY AND WHAT ELSE
AND WAIT SOMETIMES THE BORING PERSON WILL START TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BORING ANYMORE
IS 7 5 TIMES MORE DANGEROUS THAN JUST LISTENING TALKING COULD CAUSE YOU TROUBLE
USING QUESTIONS FROM AN APPRECIATIVE INQUIRY SHE ASKED WHEN WERE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IDEAL
ARE INTERESTED IN AND YOU SPEAKING PORTUGUESE DO NOT
MEMORY SO YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT YOURSELF SUCH THAT IF A
WHAT AN INTERESTING PERSON AND THE OTHER ONE YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT THANK YOU FOR THIS INTRODUCTION
AND MORE INTERESTING STORIES YOU COMMIT WHATEVER YOU HAVE SAID TO
AND LISTENING AND MY OTHER SMALL WISH IS THAT DURING THE BREAK THE BREAKS HERE
THE COLLECTION OF OUR LISTENERS SLOWLY IMPERCEPTIBLY CHANGES OUR SELF KNOWLEDGE IF THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
EVEN STARTED TO FEEL ANXIETY WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS UNTIL THAT AGE BUT LATER ON I WON SOME MOMENTS OF TRANQUILITY QUIETNESS AND MOMENTS OF JOY AND I STARTED TO
AND NOW THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT YOU HAVE TWO CREATURES IN YOUR MIND WHO KNOWS WHAT IS THE TRUTH HOW MANY CREATURES DO YOU HAVE INSIDE IS IT
I ALLOWED MYSELF TO TRY A VARIETY OF THINGS SUCH AS MASSAGE THERAPY PSYCHODRAMA
STORYTELLING CLASSES VOICE CLASSES
ZEN BUDDHISM WORKSHOPS AND MORE RECENTLY DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE FOR ME
FIRST I COULD FEEL THE PAIN AGAIN BUT I DIDN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT
YOU WILL GO AND ASK SOMEBODY AROUND YOU COULD YOU TELL ME A STORY ABOUT GOOD LISTENING ENJOY IT {NS}
STATUS BASED ON DOMINANCE BUT YOU WILL GAIN SOCIAL
YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN YOUR PATIENT WILL BE MORE SATISFIED IF YOU'RE A BOSS YOUR WORKERS WILL HAVE MORE COMMITMENT IF YOU
ALMOST 8000 PEOPLE
AND IT SUGGESTS
THAT IF YOU LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE THE BOSS THEY'LL THINK YOU ARE A LEADER OF PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO LEAD THE PEOPLE ASPECTS IN LEADERSHIP
YOU WILL FEEL MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY YOU'LL SAY WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND YOU WILL TRUST THE LISTENER
IF IT'S YOUR BOSS YOU HAVE HIGHER JOB
SO IT'S UP TO YOU TO CHOOSE HOW DO YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR STATUS AND THEN
I HAVE SAID IS NOT THAT NEW LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF PROVERBS IN THE
WHEN YOU CAME BACK HOME DON'T YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
OF THOSE ON MANY TOPICS AND LET ME FIRST SUMMARIZE TO YOU THE RESULTS
WHY I'M INTERESTED IN LISTENING
WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS OLD I STARTED TO SUFFER FROM A PAIN IN MY THROAT
PSYCHIATRISTS CALLED IT GLOBUS HYSTERICUS
COMPLETELY PSYCHOSOMATIC
EVENTUALLY I DEVELOPED DEPRESSIONS
AND EVEN CONSIDERED SUICIDE AND I COULD
38 IN LISTENING IN CONTRAST I DIDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT LISTENING CAN CAUSE DAMAGE PERHAPS 5 OF THEM SHOWED IT DOESN'T PRODUCE ANYTHING EFFECTIVE MY MOST
ALONG WITH THE NEW ONE WE'VE JUST ESTABLISHED THEY'D HAVE GOTTEN ALONG JUST FINE LET ME TELL YOU YOU KICKED OUT FROM HOME THE CHARACTER THAT YOU
COLLECT STAMPS I COLLECT SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ON LISTENING AND EVERY PAPER THAT HAS NUMERICAL DATA I TAKE IT AND PUT IT ON A PILE TO SEE THE OVERALL PICTURE OF WHAT WE KNOW AND THIS PROCESS IS CALLED META
MORE BUT YOU'LL TALK MORE COHERENTLY AND YOU'LL TELL MORE INTERESTING STORIES AND IF
VIOLENCE AGAINST THE STAFF IF YOUR MANAGER LISTENS TO YOU YOU'LL HAVE LESS BURN OUT YOUR PERFORMANCE IS HIGHER AND MAYBE A
I CAN SLIGHTLY PREDICT YOUR JOB SATISFACTION BUT IF I KNOW WHETHER YOUR BOSS LISTENS TO YOU OR NOT I HAVE A PREDICTOR THAT'S
A COUNSEL
TO OUR OWN PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES AND THE VALUE
OF
THIS ADVICE IS LIKE WATER WHICH IS SOURCE OF LIFE
THAT IS THE ADVICE THAT WE HAVE FOR OURSELVES IS SOURCE OF LIFE BUT
A MAN OR A PRISIONER OF UNDERSTANDING WILL THROW IT OUT
THIS IS THE OTHER THAT WILL BRING OUR OWN WISDOM OUTSIDE
SO I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE
WITH TWO DREAMS THAT I HAVE
ONE
I WISH THAT IN 20 OR 30 YEARS FROM NOW EVERY CHILD IN EVERY SCHOOL WILL LEARN READING
AND HERE COMES LISTENING
MY UNDERSTANDING IS
THAT WHEN YOU REALLY LISTEN
A PERSON WILL START TO HEAR HIDDEN
CHARACTERS INSIDE HIM OR
HER BUT NOT ONLY RECOGNIZE
CAREER AND THINGS WERE AS IF THEY WERE OK UNTIL BY THE AGE OF 46 I WAS HIT BY A CRISIS THAT WAS SPARKED BY A
BUT DO ME A FAVOR DO YOU REMEMBER THE CASE THAT YOU HAD THAT IN YOUR HOME THERE WAS A GOOD FRIEND SITTING
HOME AND TELLS THE PARENTS OH WE DID THIS AND THAT IN SCHOOL AND THE PARENTS SAY NOT NOW HAVE A SHOWER AND WE'LL HAVE DINNER THE CHILD WILL REMEMBER THAT WHATEVER HE OR SHE DID IN SCHOOL WAS NOT THAT INTERESTING THAT WILL BE COMMITED TO MEMORIES
TAUGHT LET'S SEE MORE DATA THERE IS ALSO
US WANT TO GAIN SOCIAL STATUS IT'S PERHAPS AN EVOLUTIONARY FORCE THAT WE CANNOT FIGHT BUT WE CAN DO IT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN
5 TIMES STRONGER AND MORE ACCURATE THAN YOUR PAY NEXT IN MY
THE GOOD OLD FRIEND BECAUSE HE OR SHE
NO ONE AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM NOW I'M GOING TO ACT SO DON'T GET
WHAT MADE IT POSSIBLE AND MY ANSWER WAS THAT I WAS SO LUCKY AS TO RAISE
DOWN AND IN THIS WAY I WAS ABLE TO RAISE A FAMILY
PARTS OF THE SELF BUT IT ALLOWS TO BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN THEM SO THE ELEMENTS
TO STAY HOME DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FOOD AND WATER FOR YOUR FAMILY TO SURVIVE FOR THREE DAYS WHAT ABOUT SEVEN DAYS IN THE REAL
SURGICAL GLOVES OR SURGICAL MASK WHAT THIS CAN
POWER OUTAGE OR STORM OR IN MY CASE THE COMING ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE THANK YOU
A ZOMBIE VIRUS IS IT TRANSMITTED BY A BITE IS IT IN THE
GO OUT AND READ FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MIGHT NEED IN THESE SITUATIONS WHATEVER THAT MAY BE GO
LIKE BIOLOGICAL OUTBREAKS OR TERRORIST ATTACKS OR A FLU OUTBREAK THE POINT
MINUTES AN HOUR
DO YOU ALREADY HAVE BAGS PREPARED
IN THE REAL WORLD WHAT THIS MIMICS
IS A NATURAL DISASTER EVACUATION
THERE'S PARALELS HERE
BUT IN THIS SCENARIO LET'S PRETEND THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE THAT THERE'S A QUARANTINE AND YOU
INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER HUMANS OR ZOMBIES HOW DO YOU KEEP YOURSELF FROM
GO TO THE RED CROSS WEBSITE GO TO FEMA LOOK AT THESE THINGS THEY HAVE GREAT LISTS SO THAT YOU CAN BE PREPARED FOR
IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEE IN BLIZZARDS AND FLOODING AND EARTQUAKES THESE ARE ALL SCENARIOS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LEAVE YOUR HOME MAYBE YOU'RE TRAPPED FOR THAT TIME PERIOD LET'S SAY THAT YOU DO HAVE FOOD AND WATER YOU KIND OF PREPARED FOR THIS
OKAY HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS SPIRITUAL IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM RAISE YOUR
GOOD IT FEELS REALLY GOOD IN WAY TOTALLY UNLIKE ANYTHING WE FEEL IN OUR NORMAL LIVES IT FEELS SOMEHOW UPLIFTING THIS IDEA THAT WE MOVE
THEY USED TO BE SEPARATE FREE LIVING BACTERIA AND THEY CAME TOGETHER AND BECAME A
WHERE WE ARE
I'M SAYING THAT THE CAPACITY FOR SELF TRANSCENDENCE IS JUST BASIC PART OF BEING HUMAN
I'M OFFERING THE METAPHOR OF A STAIRCASE IN THE MIND
I'M SAYING WE ARE HOMO DUPLEX AND THIS STAIRCASE TAKES US UP FROM THE PROFANE LEVEL
TO THE LEVEL OF THE SACRED
WHEN WE CLIMB THAT
AND THINK OF THE COLLECTIVE GRIEF IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE ALL FELT THAT BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER
NATURE'S FAVORITE SOLUTION IS TO PUT EVERYONE IN THE SAME
AFTER THE WAR HE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF OTHER SOLDIERS AND WROTE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF MEN IN BATTLE HERE'S A KEY PASSAGE WHERE HE BASICALLY DESCRIBES
AND WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE ARE BETTER NOBLER AND SOMEHOW UPLIFTED SO HERE'S THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS LIKE ME IS THE STAIRCASE A FEATURE OF OUR EVOLUTIONARY
THIS TEAM THERE'S COMPETITION THERE GUYS COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER THE SLOWEST ROWERS THE WEAKEST ROWERS ARE GOING TO GET CUT FROM THE TEAM AND ONLY A FEW OF THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO GO ON IN THE
AND THE ANTS THAT HAVE COVERED THE WORLD AND CHANGED THE
AND WITHOUT COHERENCE NOTHING CAN BE EFFECTED
IN OTHER WORDS CHARLES DARWIN
BELIEVED IN GROUP SELECTION
NOW THIS IDEA HAS BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS BUT IT'S ABOUT TO MAKE A MAJOR COMEBACK THIS
IS A SET OF MEMES SORT OF PARASITIC MEMES
THAT GET INSIDE OUR MINDS
AND MAKE US DO ALL KINDS OF CRAZY RELIGIOUS STUFF SELF DESTRUCTIVE STUFF LIKE SUICIDE BOMBING
AND AFTER ALL HOW COULD IT EVER BE GOOD FOR US
TO LOSE OURSELVES
HOW COULD IT EVER BE ADAPTIVE
FOR ANY ORGANISM
TO OVERCOME SELF INTEREST
WELL LET
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT THEY CAN ONLY WIN IF THEY ALL PULL TOGETHER AS A TEAM I MEAN THESE THINGS SOUND TRITE BUT THEY ARE DEEP EVOLUTIONARY
PEOPLE CIRCLE AROUND SOME SACRED OBJECT OR VALUE THEY'LL THEN WORK AS A TEAM AND FIGHT TO DEFEND
CALLED US HOMO DUPLEX OR TWO LEVEL MAN THE LOWER LEVEL HE
LAWS DON'T CHANGE
BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW KIND OF PLAYER ON THE FIELD
AND THINGS BEGIN TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT
NOW THIS TRANSITION WAS NOT A ONE TIME FREAK OF NATURE THAT JUST HAPPENED WITH SOME BACTERIA IT HAPPENED AGAIN ABOUT 120 OR 140 MILLION YEARS AGO WHEN
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ARE YOU RELIGIOUS PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW IF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A RELIGIOUS PERSON
THEY'RE THERE PURSUING THEIR SELF INTEREST OR ARE THEY PURSUING COMMUNAL INTEREST WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO LOSE THEMSELVES AND BECOME SIMPLY A PART OF A WHOLE
IT COME FROM WHY DO WE HAVE IT DARWIN NOTED THAT MANY OF OUR VIRTUES ARE OF VERY LITTLE USE TO OURSELVES BUT THEY'RE OF GREAT USE TO OUR GROUPS HE WROTE ABOUT THE SCENARIO IN WHICH TWO TRIBES OF
MORALISTIC SELF JUST DIES ON THE WAY UP THE STAIRCASE AND ON THIS HIGHER LEVEL HE BECOMES LOVING AND FORGIVING
GRAZE THEY DEFEND EACH OTHER THEY WORK TOGETHER THEY GENERATE WEALTH
AND AS YOU'LL SEE IN THIS SIMULATION AS THEY INTERACT THEY GAIN POINTS AS IT WERE THEY GROW AND WHEN THEY'VE DOUBLED IN SIZE YOU'LL SEE THEM SPLIT AND THAT'S HOW THEY REPRODUCE AND THE POPULATION GROWS BUT SUPPOSE THEN THAT ONE OF THEM
BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR ONE OF THESE GUYS TO TRY TO SABOTAGE THE OTHER GUYS MAYBE HE'LL BADMOUTH HIS CHIEF RIVAL TO THE COACH BUT WHILE THAT COMPETITION IS GOING ON WITHIN THE BOAT
THEY WERE ALL IN THE SAME TRIBE THEY COULD KEEP THE BENEFITS OF COOPERATION LOCKED INSIDE
AND THEY UNLOCKED THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE EVER KNOWN ON THIS PLANET
WHICH IS HUMAN COOPERATION
A FORCE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND DESTRUCTION
OF COURSE HUMAN GROUPS ARE NOWHERE NEAR AS COHESIVE AS
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A GROUP OF COOPERATORS BUT AS SOON AS YOU HAVE A GROUP OF COOPERATORS THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GET TAKEN OVER BY FREE RIDERS INDIVIDUALS THAT GOING TO EXPLOIT THE HARD WORK OF
UNUM OF MAKING A GROUP OUT OF INDIVIDUALS THINK OF THE COLLECTIVE JOY IN BRITAIN ON THE DAY WORLD WAR II
THE MAIN REASON OR ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO BE SPIRITUAL IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM MY TALK TODAY IS ABOUT SELF TRANSCENDENCE
IT'S JUST A BASIC FACT ABOUT BEING HUMAN THAT SOMETIMES THE SELF SEEMS TO JUST MELT AWAY
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE FEELING IS ECSTATIC
AND WE REACH FOR METAPHORS OF UP AND DOWN TO EXPLAIN THESE FEELINGS WE TALK ABOUT BEING UPLIFTED
OR ELEVATED
NOT NEED A MAGAZINE COVER TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL BROWN GIRL YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL NO MATTERING YOUR PAPER BROWN EVEN THE STARS STOLEN IN THEIR INFINITE GRACE ONLY SHOW UP AT THE DARKEST POINT OF NIGHT SHOWING THEIR FACES ME AND YOU WE GOING TO RELEARN WHAT BEAUTY REALLY IS BECAUSE WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT THE VALUE OF A WOMAN IS THE RATIO OF HER WAIST TO HER HIPS AND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF HER BUTTOCKS AND THE VOLUME OF HER LIPS YOUR MATH IS DANGEROUSLY WRONG
HER VALUE IS NOTHING LESS THAN INFINITE LIKE THE GALAXY LIKE THE STARS LIKE THE NIGHT LIKE YOUR SKIN LIKE LUPITA'S LIKE LIKE YOU WEREN'T HERE BEFORE SHE GOT HERE LIKE THE ONLY REASON THEY LOOK AT YOU IS BECAUSE OF HER LIKE THE ONLY REASON BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL IS BECAUSE OF HER LIKE LIKE BLACK BEEN BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF YOU LIKE WHEN WILL SOMEONE RECOGNIZE YOU DON'T YOU SEE YOURS IS TOO BROWN GIRL WHAT ABOUT YOU AND WHAT ABOUT ME AND WHAT ABOUT US AND THIS WAR WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING BROWN GIRLS HURT AND BLEEDING BROWN GIRLS SPLITTING SKIN NOT KNOWING HOW TO LOVE THEMSELVES BREAKING AND TRUTHFULLY
I WISH I WAS A POET
SO I COULD COLOR THE PAIN IN THESE WORDS WITH BEAUTIFUL RHYTHM BECAUSE NO ONE WILL BELIEVE YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL UNTIL YOU THINK YOU ARE
UNTIL YOU FEED IT DOWN PEOPLE'S THROATS I SEE LUPITA EVERYWHERE I GO
STARING AT THE EIFFEL TOWER IN PARIS
SITTING AT A SMALL CAFE IN BROOKLYN ON THE STREETS OF ACCRA IN THE MARKET PLACES OF DUBAI BUT
WHEN WILL WE SING SONGS FOR OUR DAUGHTERS
HIDE LOVE POEMS DEEP WITHIN THE HUM OF THEIR LULLABIES AND BEDTIME STORIES SO THAT WHEN THEY SLEEP THEY WON'T LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE DARK
WHEN WILL WE BELIEVE
AND HONESTLY
I KNOW YOU LISTEN TO THESE POEMS
BUT IN BETWEEN THE LINES
DEEP WITHIN THESE WORDS
LOOK FOR YOU
LOOK AT HOW YOUR HONAM SHINES
BROWN GIRL
MY NATIVE LANGUAGE FROM THE DEEP OF GHANA WEST AFRICA MEANS SKIN
WHEN THE LETTERS OF HONAM ARE REARRANGED YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THEM TRYING TO SPELL THE WORD HUMAN
LITERAL TRANSLATION
ONE'S SKIN MAKES ONE HUMAN AND IT'S FUNNY
HOW MY ANCESTORS NEVER KNOWING A WORD OF ENGLISH CAN PUT TOGETHER A PHRASE A SIMPLE REMEDY A GENTLE ANECDOTE FOR A LITTLE BROWN GIRL'S SALVATION TONIGHT LET THEM TELL IT
BROWN GIRL
WHEN THEY TEACH YOU ABOUT HONAM IN THE BLUE EYED CLASSROOMS OF YOUR SCHOOLS
DO THEY EVER ACTUALLY TELL YOU
THAT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL
OR DO THEY JUST SHOW YOU WHAT IT IS
DO THE PICTURED WOMEN IN THE HALL OF FAME FACES IN THE SHOWCASES DISPLAY LOOK LIKE YOU
ARE THE HALLS AS DEEP AND AS WIDE AS A WOMEN'S SPINE DO THE ARMS OF YOUR STUDY HALLS EMBRACE YOU WITH THIS FEMININITY ARE THERE WORDS IN YOUR TEXTBOOK LIKE LIKE HONAM LIKE LIKE AMNIOTIC LOVE LIKE UBANI NENTU WATCH HER WALK WITH GRACE DURING LUNCH TIME
DO YOU HOPSCOTCH ON THE STRETCH MARKS OF WOMEN WHO WERE MEND SKINNED AS DEEP AS THE NIGHT NO
SOMETHING IN YOU BREAKS THOUGH DOESN'T IT
WHO ARE DIPLOMATS WE ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH CONFLICTS BETWEEN STATES AND ISSUES BETWEEN STATES AND I CAN TELL YOU OUR AGENDA IS FULL
THERE IS TRADE THERE IS DISARMAMENT THERE IS CROSS BORDER RELATIONS
BUT THE PICTURE IS CHANGING
AND WE ARE SEEING THAT THERE ARE NEW KEY PLAYERS COMING ONTO THE SCENE
WE LOOSELY CALL THEM GROUPS
THEY MAY REPRESENT SOCIAL RELIGIOUS POLITICAL ECONOMIC MILITARY REALITIES
AND WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM
IT IS DOING SO BECAUSE IT IS NEUTRAL
AND THAT'S ONE REASON WHY THAT ORGANIZATION PROBABLY IS THE BEST INFORMED KEY PLAYER TO UNDERSTAND MODERN CONFLICT
BECAUSE THEY TALK
MY POINT IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NEUTRAL TO TALK
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WHEN YOU SIT DOWN WITH THE OTHER SIDE
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS WALK
BUT IF YOU DON'T TALK YOU CAN'T ENGAGE THE OTHER SIDE
AND THE OTHER SIDE WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO ENGAGE IS THE ONE WITH WHOM YOU PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE
PRIME MINISTER RABIN SAID WHEN HE ENGAGED THE OSLO PROCESS YOU DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR FRIENDS
YOU MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR ENEMIES IT'S HARD
BUT IT IS NECESSARY
LET ME GO ONE STEP FURTHER THIS IS TAHRIR
INSIDE THE PALESTINIAN POPULATION
BETWEEN THE PEOPLES OF PALESTINE AND ISRAEL
AND AS WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS BROAD MOVEMENT ACROSS THE ARAB WORLD
WE ARE NOT POWERLESS WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND WE NEED THE COURAGE TO USE THEM IN MY COUNTRY
I HAVE SEEN HOW
THE COUNCIL OF ISLAMIST GROUPS
AND CHRISTIAN GROUPS CAME TOGETHER NOT AS A GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE
BUT THEY CAME TOGETHER ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE TO ESTABLISH CONTACT AND DIALOGUE
IN TIMES WHERE THINGS WERE PRETTY LOW KEY TENSION
AND WHEN TENSION INCREASED
THEY ALREADY HAD THAT DIALOGUE
AND THAT WAS A STRENGTH TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT ISSUES
OUR MODERN WESTERN SOCIETIES ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN BEFORE IN THIS TIME OF MIGRATION HOW ARE WE GOING TO SETTLE
AND BUILD A BIGGER WE TO DEAL WITH OUR ISSUES IF WE DON'T IMPROVE OUR SKILLS OF COMMUNICATION
SO THERE ARE MANY REASONS AND FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS THIS
IS TIME AND THIS IS WHY WE MUST TALK THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
CAN BE ACCOMPANIED WITH INCLUSION OR NOT INCLUSION THERE'S A BIG ARRAY OF THE
THE GOOD THING IS THAT WE ARE NOT POWERLESS WE HAVE NEVER HAD
AS MANY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION MEANS OF BEING CONNECTED
MEANS OF REACHING OUT MEANS OF INCLUDING
THE DIPLOMATIC TOOLBOX
IS ACTUALLY FULL OF DIFFERENT TOOLS WE CAN USE TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNICATION
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE COMING OUT OF A DECADE WHERE WE HAD A FEAR OF TOUCHING IT
NOW I HOPE IN THE COMING YEARS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THROUGH SOME CONCRETE EXAMPLES
THAT FEAR IS RECEDING
I FIRST CAME TO AFGHANISTAN IN 2005 AS A FOREIGN MINISTER I MET THE COMMANDER OF ISAF THE INTERNATIONAL TROOPS
AND HE TOLD ME THAT THIS CAN BE WON MILITARILY MINISTER
WE JUST HAVE TO PERSEVERE
NOW FOUR COM ISAF'S LATER
WE HEAR A DIFFERENT MESSAGE
THIS CANNOT BE WON MILITARILY
WE NEED MILITARY PRESENCE BUT WE NEED TO MOVE TO POLITICS
WE CAN ONLY SOLVE THIS THROUGH A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND IT IS NOT US WHO WILL SOLVE IT AFGHANS HAVE TO SOLVE IT
BUT THEN THEY NEED A DIFFERENT POLITICAL PROCESS THAN THE ONE THEY WERE GIVEN IN 2001 2002
THEY NEED AN INCLUSIVE PROCESS
WHERE THE REAL FABRIC OF THIS VERY COMPLICATED SOCIETY CAN DEAL WITH THEIR ISSUES
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO AGREE WITH THAT IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO
NOW EVERYBODY
AND THE PARADOX IS THAT THE DECADE BEFORE THE LAST DECADE WAS SO PROMISING AND FOR ONE REASON PRIMARILY AND THE REASON IS WHAT HAPPENED IN SOUTH AFRICA NELSON MANDELA
UPON THEM MY OPINIONS AND MY VALUES I CANNOT DO THAT UNLESS I SEND THE SIGNALS THAT I WILL BE OPEN TO LISTEN TO THE OTHER SIDE'S SIGNALS WE NEED A LOT MORE TRAINING ON HOW TO DO THAT AND A LOT MORE PRACTICE ON HOW THAT
IS NOT EASY
NOT BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS NOT BETWEEN GROUPS NOT BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS
BUT IT IS VERY NECESSARY
IF WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH POLITICAL CONFLICT SOLVING OF CONFLICTS
IF WE'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND THESE NEW
GROUPS WHICH ARE COMING FROM BOTTOM UP
SUPPORTED BY TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO ALL
WE DIPLOMATS CANNOT BE SITTING BACK IN THE BANQUETS
BELIEVING THAT WE ARE DOING INTERSTATE RELATIONS WE HAVE TO CONNECT
WITH THESE
AS YOU KNOW MANDELA DIDN'T DO THAT
IN HIS MEMOIRS LONG
ROAD TO FREEDOM HE WROTE THAT
HE SURVIVED DURING THOSE YEARS OF CAPTIVITY
BECAUSE HE ALWAYS DECIDED TO LOOK UPON HIS OPPRESSOR AS ALSO BEING A HUMAN BEING
A STRATEGY OF ENGAGEMENT AND PRINCIPLED DIALOGUE AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THIS APPROACH IN MODERN DIPLOMACY NOT ONLY BETWEEN STATES BUT ALSO WITHIN STATES
RIGHT NOW THE DISCUSSION GOES SHOULD WE TALK TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SHOULD WE TALK TO HAMAS IF WE TALK TO THEM WE MAY LEGITIMIZE THEM I THINK THAT IS WRONG
WHAT IT WILL BE CALLED IN THE END
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
THE POINT IS THAT WE ARE PROBABLY SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE ARAB WORLD
A REVOLUTION BOTTOM UP
PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION
SOCIAL GROUPS ARE TAKING TO THE STREETS
AND WE FIND OUT IN THE WEST THAT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
BECAUSE WE NEVER TALK TO THE PEOPLE IN THESE COUNTRIES
MOST GOVERNMENTS FOLLOWED THE DICTATE OF THE AUTHORITARIAN LEADERS TO STAY AWAY FROM THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS BECAUSE THEY WERE
TERRORISTS
SO NOW THAT THEY ARE EMERGING IN THE STREET AND WE SALUTE THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION
WE FIND OUT HOW LITTLE WE KNOW
DEFICITS WE STRUGGLE WITH TODAY WE THINK OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC
ALSO BEING A HUMAN BEING
SO HE ENGAGED
A POLITICAL PROCESS OF DIALOGUE
NOT AS A STRATEGY
OF THE WEAK BUT AS STRATEGY OF THE STRONG
AND HE ENGAGED TALKING PROFOUNDLY
BY SETTLING SOME OF THE MOST TRICKY ISSUES THROUGH A TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE CAME AND TALKED
NOT NAIVE
YOU CANNOT TALK TO EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME AND THERE ARE TIMES YOU SHOULD WALK
AND SOMETIMES MILITARY INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT LIBYA WAS NECESSARY
AND THAT MILITARY INTERVENTION IN AFGHANISTAN WAS ALSO NECESSARY AND MY COUNTRY RELIES ON ITS SECURITY
THROUGH MILITARY ALLIANCE
THAT'S CLEAR
BUT STILL WE HAVE A LARGE DEFICIT IN DEALING WITH AND UNDERSTANDING MODERN
TO HAVE DIPLOMACY WHICH IS DISCONNECTED FROM PEOPLE AND CIVIL SOCIETY
AND WE HAVE TO GO ALSO BEYOND TRADITIONAL DIPLOMACY TO THE SURVIVAL ISSUE OF OUR TIMES CLIMATE CHANGE
HOW WE GOING TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE CIVIL SOCIETY AND PEOPLE NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT PART OF THE SOLUTION
IT IS GOING TO DEMAND AN INCLUSIVE PROCESS OF DIPLOMACY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE WE ARE PRACTICING TODAY AS WE ARE HEADING TO NEW ROUNDS OF DIFFICULT CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS
BUT WHEN WE MOVE TOWARD SOMETHING WHICH HAS TO BE MUCH MORE ALONG A BROAD MOBILIZATION
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IS THE WRONG THING IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
ENGAGING WITH CIVIL SOCIETY
ALL OF A SUDDEN NGOS WERE NOT ONLY STANDING IN THE STREETS CRYING THEIR SLOGANS BUT THEY WERE TAKING THEM INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS
PARTLY BECAUSE THEY REPRESENTED THE VICTIMS OF THESE WEAPONS
AND THEY BROUGHT THEIR KNOWLEDGE
AND THERE WAS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN DIPLOMACY AND THE POWER COMING BOTTOM
WE DON'T ACCEPT MAJORITY RIGHTS
BECAUSE THEY MAY TURN OUT TO BE A MAJORITY
HOW CAN WE ESCAPE HAVING A DOUBLE STANDARD
IF WE AT THE SAME TIME PREACH DEMOCRACY AND AT THE SAME TIME DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE GROUPS THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE HOW WILL WE EVER BE INTERLOCUTORS
NOW MY DIPLOMATS ARE INSTRUCTED TO TALK TO ALL THESE GROUPS
BUT TALKING CAN BE DONE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
ACKNOWLEDGMENT WE'VE SEEN DURING THESE YEARS
RECENT YEARS IS THAT VERY FEW
OF THESE DOMESTIC INTERSTATE INTRASTATE CONFLICTS CAN BE SOLVED MILITARILY
THEY MAY HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH WITH MILITARY MEANS BUT THEY CANNOT BE SOLVED BY MILITARY MEANS THEY NEED POLITICAL SOLUTIONS
AND WE THEREFORE HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ESCAPE TRADITIONAL DIPLOMACY
AND WE HAVE AMONG STATES A RELUCTANCE IN DEALING WITH THEM
PLUS
DURING THE LAST DECADE WE'VE BEEN IN THE MODE
WHERE DEALING WITH GROUPS WAS CONCEPTUALLY AND POLITICALLY DANGEROUS
AFTER 9 11
EITHER YOU WERE WITH US OR AGAINST US
IS CALLED THE LIFENAUT PROJECT LIKE ASTRONAUT ONLY LIFENAUT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE IS IT POSSIBLE TO UPLOAD HUMAN MINDS TO NEW FORMS LIKE ROBOTS OR AVATARS
REANIMATE HER PERSONALITY AND WE THOUGHT WE GIVE THE WORLD A GLIMPSE WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK
ON ONE LEVEL THIS IS A DECADE LONG EXPERIMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND ANOTHER WAY IT'S A LOVE LETTER TO THE FUTURE BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF YOUR LIVES IS
SHE'S LIKE A THREE YEAR OLD IN TERMS THAT SHE'S VERY VERY SIMPLE SO IT'S VERY PRIMITIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THIS MIND UPLOADING TECHNOLOGY BEAUSE WE'RE STILL DEVELOPING IT BUT SHE'S MEANT TO HAVE SOCIAL
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WE USE A MICROPHONE LIKE THIS SO THAT SHE CAN HEAR YOU AND WE ASK HER QUESTIONS AND SHE TRIES TO
MINDFILES OF THEMSELVES OR OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE IT'S CALLED LIFENAUT COM BRUCE RUNS IT AND THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE
TRANSCRIBED AND PUT INTO A DATABASE AND THEN WE SPENT FIVE YEARS WORKING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO USE THIS INFORMATION
HER FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE IS WELCOME TO ASK QUESTIONS TO
IS THE POTENTIAL
OUTCOME OF THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY AS ONE DAY IT MAY BE QUITE NORMAL FOR US
TO HAVE SCHOOLMATES TO HAVE WORK COLLEAGUES TO HAVE CITIZENS LIVING THAT ARE CYBER CITIZENS CYBER MINDS
PEOPLE WHO ARE INHABITING CONSCIOUSNESS BUT MAYBE IN DIFFERENT FORM SO THEY MAY NOT LOOK LIKE HUMANS THEY MAY LOOK LIKE A VERY SMART ROBOT WE'RE NOT SURE AB OK WE HAVE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THE MIKE THANK YOU
IN RESPONSE TO THE INPUT IN RESPONSE TO THE UNIQUE QUESTION SOMETIMES YOU CAN ASK HER THE SAME QUESTION AND SHE'LL SAY DIFFERENT ANSWERS EACH TIME
DEPENDING ON SLIGHT CHANGES ON THE WORDING OF YOUR QUESTION
AND ALSO THE STATE OF MIND THAT SHE'S IN AT THE TIME
RIGHT NOW BINA48 IS MAKING A MAP OF THIS ROOM WITH HER CAMERA
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE DYING IN AFRICA WITH NOT ARRIVING 30 YEARS OLD HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NOT LETTING SPACE FOR NEW GENERATIONS AND DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH MEANING IN YOUR LIFE IF YOU ARE NOT GONNA DIE THANK YOU
IS SHE ABLE TO DO AND ALSO WHY ONLY THIS PART BD SO BINA48 CAN DO A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID SHE HAS TWO CAMERAS IN HER EYES SO SHE CAN SEE YOU WE
PART TWO IS IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO UPLOAD YOUR MIND TO NEW FORM
THEN SOMETHING ELSE BECOMES POSSIBLE WHICH IS YOU CAN GO MOBILE WE CAN TRANSFER YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO NEW FORMS
PERHAPS
IN THE BEGINNING A ROBOT
AN AVATAR IN A COMPUTER AND SOME DAY
MAYBE WE'LL BUILD YOU A NEW BODY AND YOU CAN PUT A NEW MIND IN A
FOR 100 FREE FOREVER YOU CAN UPLOAD INFORMATION STARTING NOW MAYBE IT WILL TAKE YOU DECADES TO COMPLETE
IN THE CASE OF BINA48 IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING IT'S A VERY PRIMITIVE EXAMPLE OF CAPTURING THE CONSCIOUSNESS THE PERSONALITY THE MANNERISMS THE ATTITUDES AND THE BELIEFS OF A PERSON IN
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO SAY UNTIL OUR INTELLIGENCE TELLS US WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS CONVERSATION WHAT IS THE CONTEXT
AND THAT'S WHAT BINA48 IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE CONTEXT OF YOUR QUESTION WHAT DO
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT AND THE TOPIC
ABOUT HER LIKES HER DISLIKES HER MEMORIES HER ATTITUDES HER BELIEFS THIS INFORMATION WAS THEN
WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE THIS SAYING THAT EVERYBODY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM CAN
AM3 HELLO BINA I HAVE A QUESTION AS YOU ARE AWARE THAT YOU ARE NOT A HUMAN WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE PURPOSE OF YOUR CREATION BD
QUESTION HERE DO YOU LIKE POPCORN BD DO
IS SHE ABLE TO DO AND ALSO WHY ONLY THIS
SO WHAT DID YOU DO WHAT DID YOU TAKE
AWAY
THE WONDERFUL HAPPY EVENT
IS THAT MT FUJI
WAS INSCRIBED ON THE UNESCO'S WORLD HERITAGE LIST
MY FATHER WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE CITY OF NUMAZU
IN
HE PASSED AWAY A FEW HOURS LATER BEFORE DAWN 6 WEEKS LATER MT FUJI WAS OFFICIALLY
AND WILL HELP US BUILD TRUE WORLD PEACE
ARE BEST REPRESENTED IN THE MAKING OF JAPANESE GARDENS
ARE NO MORE THAN PART OF NATURE AND SEEK A LIFESTYLE WHICH UNITES WITH NATURE AND NEVER CHALLENGE IT HEAD ON
ISSUES TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE PLANET INCLUDING OUR FIGHT AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING SECOND THIS WILL HELP US DEVELOP
WHEN I LEARNED THAT ICOMOS WHICH IS THE ADVISORY BODY OF UNESCO MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT FUJI SAN SHOULD BE INSCRIBED ON THE WORLD HERITAGE LIST SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO
TELLS THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE BEST JAPANESE GARDEN YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT NATURE TELLS YOU THIS IS IN A SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE WESTERN GARDENS
A CRANE
TSURU
TRANSFORMS ITSELF INTO A HUMAN LADY
TO HELP THE MAN WHO SAVED ITS LIFE
THIS MAY NEVER HAPPEN IN THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION
BECAUSE IN
THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SUPERIOR TO NATURE
SO MAYBE A DEMON
TRANSFORMS MAN INTO SWAN
THE LIFE OF A DIPLOMAT
THEY SAY
WHEN A DIPLOMAT SAYS YES
HE MEANS PERHAPS
WHEN HE SAYS PERHAPS
HE MEANS NO
AND IF HE SAYS NO
ASSERTIVE IN TRYING TO MAKE AS A PERFECT ROUND AS POSSIBLE
DESIGNED
COMPOSED OF STRAIGHT LINES
COMPLETE CIRCLES
AND TOTAL SYMMETRY
ASSERTING HUMAN SUPERIORITY
OVER NATURE
HOWEVER
HUMANS AS A REVENGE BY TRANSFORMING THEMSELVES
IN MANYOSYU THE OLDEST
ANTHOLOGY OF JAPANESE SHORT POEM WAKA
TO
KATSUSHIKA HOKUSAI AND OTHER WOODBLOCK
PRINT ARTISTS IN EDO PERIOD
THE ESSENCE OF TRADITIONAL JAPANESE AESTHETIC
COMES FROM
LANDSCAPE BUT ITS ROLE AS A SOURCE OF ARTISTIC INSPIRATION THAT WAS APPRECIATED BY UNESCO
OF MT FUJI AS A WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE WILL HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE TRADITIONAL VIEWS OF NATURE HELD BY THE JAPANESE
YEAR HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT YEAR FOR ME I HAD A VERY SAD EVENT AND VERY WONDERFUL
EXACTLY WHAT MY FATHER WANTED ME TO DO AFTER THE OFFICIAL INSCRIPTION OF MT FUJI ON THE WORLD HERITAGE LIST THANK YOU
OR COMPLETE CIRCLES
NO
PERFECT SYMMETRY IN THE REAL WORLD
THEY ONLY EXIST IN HUMAN BRAIN
THE SIMILAR DIFFERENCE
EXISTS IN THE WORLD OF
CERAMIC WEAR
HERITAGE HE RESIGNED MANY YEARS AGO AND MOVED TO ATAMI ANOTHER CITY IN SHIZUOKA PREFECTURE WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE A
SO I THINK THESE
UNIQUE VIEWS OF
NATURE DEVELOPED AND HELD BY THE JAPANESE SHOULD BE
BETTER
APPRECIATED BY CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE
AND ALSO SHOULD BE SHARED
BY THE REST OF THE WORLD
FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS ONE
JAPANESE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OR HUMANS ARE ONLY PART OF NATURE GOES ON TO ACCEPT THAT EVEN FURNITURE HAS EMOTION THIS
I SAID YES TO THE INVITATION FROM TEDXKYOTO I REALLY MEANT IT BECAUSE
OF AWE FOR AND LOVE OF NATURE DEVELOPED OVER THE CENTURIES YOU MAY WONDER
PLACES HUMANS ABOVE NATURE
AND HE SPENT ALL HIS SCHOOL DAYS WORSHIPING AND ADMIRING MT FUJI SO IT IS QUITE NATURAL
I'M GOING TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE EXPRESSION I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S BAD IDEA AND I AM GOING TO ARGUE FOR ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE
I GOT DEPRESSED
HADN'T BEEN DEPRESSED THE NIGHT BEFORE
IN FACT I'D BEEN RELATIVELY CONTENT
AT BEDTIME BUT MY LAST DAY
EVER
AM I REALLY GOING TO GO INTO WORK
EVEN IF I LOVE IT
NO
AM I GOING
TO GO WHILE GIVING ME TIME TO LISTEN TO SOME GREAT BOOKS AND ADMIRE THE TREES ALONG THE ROADWAY
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM
THEY'RE ACTUALLY THERE
AND THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL
YES I DO WANT TO FEEL THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF
DIED OF STAGE 4 BREAST CANCER
BY THE TIME SHE'D BECOME SYMPTOMATIC ENOUGH TO BE DIAGNOSED OR TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION
IT'D METASTASIZED TO HER LUNGS LIVER AND BONE
THAT DIAGNOSIS CAME IN 2003
AND SHE WAS GIVEN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE
THAT'S JUST 180 DAYS
HERE WAS A VIBRANT POSITIVE ENERGETIC WOMAN IN HER EARLY 50S
A VEGETARIAN
NOT ONE
YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING
SHE'S BEING A LITTLE LITERAL RIGHT NOW AND MAYBE A BIT DRAMATIC AND MAYBE I AM
BUT I HAVE A BIT OF A CASE STUDY TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT SUPPORTS THE FINDINGS OF MY OWN MIRROR EXPERIMENT
NINE YEARS AGO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD JANESSA AULONT
DAY AS THOUGH IT'S YOUR LAST
LIVE EACH DAY AS THOUGH IT'S YOUR FIRST
IF WE LIVE EACH DAY FULL OF WONDER AND APPRECIATION WHILE DISCOVERING A GENUINE SENSE OF JOY
I BELIEVE THAT MOTIVATION FOR OUR TRUEST PASSION WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO PRESENT ITSELF
AND JANESSA STARTED WRITING AGAIN AFTER DAY 181 BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE DAYS ON THE HORIZON NOT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T
WHAT A GIFT FUTURE DAYS ARE
SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH DAY TO DAY ROUTINE AND RESPONSIBILITY WHILE PURSUING OUR PASSION IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL OR NOTHING
I NOW LOOK IN THE MIRROR EACH MORNING AND I ASK MYSELF
IF TODAY WERE THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIFE
AND I HAVE MORE DAYS AHEAD
WOULD I WANT TO DO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO TODAY
YES
I DO WANT TO GO IN TO WORK SO THAT I CAN FUND MY JOY PROJECTS
AND EAT
OR WASTE TIME
SHAKE THINGS UP BY USING DISCOMFORT AS A CHANGE MOTIVATOR
I GET IT
ALL FINE AND GOOD AND GREAT IN THEORY
BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I TRIED IT
HAVING FULLY BOUGHT IN TO STEVE'S SUGGESTION I WOKE UP THE MORNING AFTER WATCHING THE VIDEO RUBBED THE SLEEP FROM MY EYES I LEANED IN FOR A CLOSER LOOK AT MY REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR
AND I SAID EXACTLY THE SAME WORDS HE DID
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
GAVE AWAY MOST OF HER CHERISHED POSSESSIONS INCLUDING HER MUCH LOVED CHERRY RED MIATA CONVERTIBLE SHE HAD BEEN WRITING A CHILDREN'S BOOK BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO FINISH IT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO CHECK ANYTHING OFF HER BUCKET
BACK TENFOLD AND SHE LIVED FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS FROM THAT NEW BIRTHDAY ON DAY
YOU'VE BEEN GIFTED A FUTURE BE THAT A DAY A MONTH A YEAR OR 40 YEARS YOUR MIRROR AWAITS {NS}
SHE DID AND SHE WOULD DRIVE AROUND IN THAT CONVERTIBLE WITH HER LITTLE BOLD HEAD TUCKED SAFELY UNDER WIDE BRIMMED HAT HER BEAUTIFUL
SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY
NO INTEREST
UNTIL
DAY 181
TO HEAR HER TELL THE STORY SHE WOKE UP ON THAT MORNING AND SAID UH WAIT A MINUTE
I'M STILL HERE
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE EVENTUAL END
YES I DO THINK THAT KNOWING WE ARE GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY CAN BE A MOTIVATOR FOR SOME
INCLUDING STEVE JOBS WHO WAS IN REMISSION AT THE TIME OF HIS COMMENCEMENT SPEECH
BUT HOW REALISTIC IN APPROACH IS THAT FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO'S PERFECTLY HEALTHY
I THINK THAT MOST OF US THINK ABOUT OUR LAST DAYS ON OCCASION
BUT WE THEN PUT THEM IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS AND GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS
STILL
SOME OF US
WORRY ABOUT THAT TIME CONSTRAINT AND RACK OUR BRAINS ON HOW TO LEAVE OUR MARK ON THE WORLD GIVEN OUR NOW MYRIAD OF CHOICES TO THE POINT OF BECOMING COMPLETELY INCAPACITATED DO
IF I LIVED EACH DAY LIKE IT WAS THEN IT PROBABLY SOON WOULD BE
SO I WATCHED IN THE MIRROR THAT FIRST MORNING AS MY SMILE TURNED INTO A FROWN AND THE REST OF THE DAY WAS ESSENTIALLY SHOT
AS WAS THE DAY AFTER THAT
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT
BECAUSE LIKE ANY GOOD EXPERIMENT YOU HAVE TO TRY IT MORE THAN ONCE
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS ABOUT LIVING EACH DAY LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE TO ME
FIRST THERE'S THE SENSE OF PANIC THAT CAN ENSUE WHEN FACED WITH AN IMMINENT EXPIRATION DAY WHETHER REAL OR HYPOTHETICAL
URGENCY CAUSES STRESS
AND I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE HEARD THAT EITHER
I KNOW THAT IF I SAY I HAVE GOT TO VERSUS I REALLY WANT YOU MY ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY CHANGES
ALSO IN OUR LAST DAY SCENARIOS
AGAIN MINE BEING PARIS
ARE ENTIRELY BASED ON US BEING PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF PULLING OFF ALL OF THE THINGS ON OUR LIST FOR A LAST DAY
NOT GOING TO GO THERE
WHERE I AM GOING TO GO IF IT'S MY LAST DAY
IS PARIS
AND I'M GOING TO MAX OUT ALL MY CREDIT CARDS TO TAKE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVE WITH ME
I'M GOING TO SMOKE FRENCH CIGARETTES
EVEN THOUGH I QUIT YEARS AGO
I'M GOING TO EAT AND DRINK WHATEVER I WANT AND FLIRT WITH A LOT OF FRENCH MEN
I'M ALSO GOING TO WEAR THE MOST ABSURD OUTFIT THAT I CAN THINK OF THAT MAKES ME FEEL WHIMSICAL AND ECCENTRIC INSTEAD OF CONSERVATIVE AND SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE
AND I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO FLOSS
TASKS AND MAYBE EVEN GIVE A KIND WORD AND A SMILE TO PEOPLE WHO ANNOY ME
I DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP THAT OBGYN APPOINTMENT BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW THAT I'M DOING EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO STAVE OFF THAT LAST DAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
JANESSA KNEW THAT SHE HAD A LUMP IN HER LEFT BREAST
BUT SHE CHOSE TO IGNORE IT
BECAUSE SHE'D BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH FIBROIDS SO MANY TIMES
SHE WAS CONVINCED IT WAS JUST MORE OF THE SAME
PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU
IF LIVING EACH DAY AS THOUGH IT'S YOUR LAST WORKS FOR YOU
THAT'S GREAT
BUT IF IT DOESN'T
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO GET UP TOMORROW MORNING
LOOK IN THE MIRROR
RUB THE SLEEP FROM YOUR EYES
AND TRY LIVING EACH DAY AS THOUGH IT'S YOUR FIRST
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD THAT EXPRESSION BEFORE OK HOW MANY OF YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT EACH DAY I GOT A HALF A WAVE OK MOST OF YOU NO
THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOREVER
I FOUND WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE APPARENTLY HAVE SAID IT THROUGHOUT HISTORY
EVEN AS FAR BACK AS THE ROMAN EMPIRE
BUT I COULDN'T FIND ITS ORIGIN SOLIDLY LINK TO ANY ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR
LIKE MOST OF YOU I'VE BEEN HEARING IT MOST OF MY LIFE
AND MOST RECENTLY WHILE WATCHING STEVE JOBS GIVING HIS NOW FAMOUS COMMENCEMENT SPEECH AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN
2005
ON YOUTUBE
IN THAT SPEECH HE SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT BY THAT TIME HE HAD MADE A 33 YEAR HABIT OUT OF LOOKING IN THE MIRROR EACH MORNING AND ASKING
ONCE YOU KNOW I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A WRITER BUT GUESS WHAT I'VE BEEN ONE ALL ALONG SO WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE TO
SHE APPRECIATED IT AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH HER EYES REALLY WAS KIND OF LIKE SEEING IT THROUGH THE EYES OF CHILD SHE EMBRACED EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY WITH A RENEWED
AND HER ONE THROUGH FIVE GAVE HER JOY REGARDLESS OF OUTCOME UNPUBLISHED SHE SAID TO ME
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LAST DAYS THEY CAN BE PEACEFUL AT TIMES SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT BUT NOT ONE PERSON THAT I'VE TAKEN CARE OF HAS BEEN PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF ACCOMPLISHING ANY
EACH DAY LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST I DID SOME RESEARCH AND
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE IGNORANT
SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER IT AN INSULT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S UNINFORMED OR UNAWARE
BUT I CHOOSE TO LOOK AT IGNORANCE IN DIFFERENT WAY
I BELIEVE THAT IGNORANCE IS MORE THAN JUST BEING NAIVE
IT CAN MEAN TO REJECT OR IGNORE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
CHOOSING TO DISREGARD INFORMATION OR FACT
TO BE WILLFULLY IGNORANT CAN LEAD TO AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND INNOVATIONS
THERE ARE COUNTLESS
WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON IN THIS DECADE AND TO DO THE OTHER THINGS
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE
HARD ON JULY 20TH 1969 NEIL ARMSTRONG WALKED ON THE MOON
AND 45 YEARS AGO TODAY
ICE WALLS AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER CHALLENGES STOOD IN THEIR WAY BUT HILLARY AND NORGAY NEVER GAVE UP DESPITE ALL THE SETBACKS AND MISSTEPS THEY PUSHED THROUGH THEY HAD PASSION THEY HAD DETERMINATION THEY HAD PERSEVERANCE THEY HAD GRIT
CLIMBERS AND SHERPA IN HIS EXPEDITION HE
THIS NEW FRONTIER WHEN JOHN F KENNEDY SAID
WITH A VISION FOR GREATNESS AND I WAS ALL IN IN THE EARLY DAYS I REMEMBER WE WERE ONLY ABOUT 20 PEOPLE AND I TOLD ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS THAT IN A YEAR WE'D BE 50 PEOPLE HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS NUTS THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT IT'D BE
AND FRANKLY THAT PISSED ME OFF
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW WE'D DO IT AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HARD IT WOULD BE ALL THE CHALLENGES WE'D RUN INTO BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO PROVE HIM WRONG
AND I WAS LUCKY TO WORK FOR SOME GREAT LEADERS WHO EMPOWERED ME TO MAKE DIFFERENCE I WORKED MY BUTT OFF AND WE GREW OUR TEAM
TODAY I'M HUMBLED TO
CONSIDERED UNCLIMBABLE BY MANY WHEN HE SET OUT HE DIDN'T FOCUS ON ALL THE CHALLENGES BETWEEN HIM AND THE SUMMIT HE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT ALL
LEADERS BUT THE WILLFUL IGNORANCE OF THESE GREAT MEN AND WOMEN ALONE DID NOT LEAD TO THEIR SUCCESS THESE INNOVATORS ALSO SHARED THREE VERY IMPORTANT TRAITS THEY HAD
{NS} WELL TODAY I'D HOPE TO PERSUADE YOU TO CONSIDER THE POWER OF IGNORANCE
BE ABLE TO FLY
THE MASS OF ITS BODY AND THE SIZE OF ITS WINGS SHOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
WELL THE GOOD NEWS IS
NOBODY TOLD THE BUMBLEBEE
I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU ALL TO EMBRACE YOUR IGNORANCE FIND AN AUDACIOUS GOAL FOR YOURSELF
AND FORGET ABOUT ALL THE REASONS WHY NOT
WORK HARD SURROUND
IN ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES OF ALL TIMES AMELIA SAID NEVER INTERRUPT SOMEONE DOING SOMETHING YOU SAID COULDN'T BE DONE
HIM OR HAD LOST THEIR LIVES
SIR EDMUND HILLARY PICTURED HIMSELF HOLDING THE FLAG OF HIS COUNTRY ON THE HIGHEST POINT IN THE WORLD
HIS VISION LED TO HIS SUCCESS HE DIDN'T LET THE FACTS OR THE ODDS DISCOURAGE HIM
BUT SIR EDMUND HILLARY DID NOT CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST ALONE
HE
GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BUT THE GREAT LEADERS OF OUR HISTORY CHOSE TO LOOK PAST ALL THE REASONS
WOULD
TELL STORY ABOUT SOMEONE WHO MADE ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS OBJECTS OF HIS ERA
AND THE MAN'S NAME IS CARL NORDEN
CARL NORDEN WAS BORN IN 1880 AND HE
WAS SWISS AND OF COURSE THE SWISS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO GENERAL CATEGORIES THOSE WHO MAKE SMALL EXQUISITE EXPENSIVE OBJECTS AND THOSE WHO HANDLE THE MONEY OF THOSE WHO
OBSESSED WITH THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DROP BOMBS FROM AN AIRPLANE
NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN THE AGE BEFORE GPS AND RADAR THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A REALLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM IT'S A COMPLICATED PHYSICS PROBLEM
YOU'VE GOT A PLANE THAT'S THOUSANDS OF FEET UP IN THE AIR GOING AT HUNDREDS OF MILES AN HOUR AND YOU'RE TRYING TO
IRAQ WAR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST IRAQ WAR THE U S MILITARY THE AIR FORCE SENT TWO SQUADRONS OF F 15E FIGHTER EAGLES TO THE IRAQI DESERT EQUIPPED WITH THESE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CAMERAS THAT ALLOWED THEM TO SEE THE ENTIRE DESERT FLOOR AND THEIR MISSION WAS TO FIND AND TO DESTROY REMEMBER THE SCUD MISSILE LAUNCHERS THOSE SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES THAT THE IRAQIS WERE LAUNCHING AT THE ISRAELIS THE MISSION OF THE TWO SQUADRONS WAS TO GET RID OF ALL THE SCUD MISSILE LAUNCHERS AND SO THEY FLEW MISSIONS DAY AND NIGHT AND THEY DROPPED THOUSANDS OF BOMBS AND THEY FIRED THOUSANDS OF MISSILES IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF THIS PARTICULAR SCOURGE
AND AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER THERE WAS AN AUDIT DONE AS THE ARMY ALWAYS DOES THE AIR FORCE ALWAYS DOES AND THEY ASKED THE QUESTION HOW MANY SCUDS DID WE ACTUALLY DESTROY
YOU KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER WAS
MILLIONS OF MEN FOUGHT EACH OTHER IN THE TRENCHES GETTING NOWHERE MAKING NO PROGRESS AND HERE SOMEONE HAD COME UP WITH A DEVICE THAT ALLOWED THEM TO FLY UP IN THE SKIES HIGH ABOVE ENEMY TERRITORY AND DESTROY WHATEVER THEY WANTED WITH PINPOINT ACCURACY
NORDEN FAMOUSLY SAYS BEFORE THAT BOMBSIGHT CAME ALONG
BOMBS WOULD ROUTINELY MISS THEIR TARGET BY A MILE OR MORE BUT HE SAID WITH THE MARK 15 NORDEN BOMBSIGHT HE COULD DROP A BOMB INTO A PICKLE BARREL AT 20000 FT NOW I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW INCREDIBLY EXCITED THE U S MILITARY WAS BY THE NEWS OF THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT
IT WAS LIKE MANNA FROM HEAVEN
THEY ACTUALLY CAN DO THAT NOW BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT
AND HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EGO AND HE WORKS 16 HOUR DAYS AND HE HAS VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT ALTERNATING CURRENT
AND HE FEELS LIKE A SUNTAN IS A SIGN OF MORAL WEAKNESS
AND HE DRINKS LOTS OF COFFEE AND HE DOES HIS BEST WORK SITTING IN HIS MOTHER'S KITCHEN IN ZURICH FOR HOURS IN COMPLETE SILENCE WITH NOTHING BUT A SLIDE RULE
AS WELL THIS DEVICE HAD INCREDIBLE MORAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE NORDEN WAS A COMMITTED CHRISTIAN IN FACT HE WOULD ALWAYS GET UPSET WHEN PEOPLE REFERRED TO THE BOMBSIGHT AS HIS INVENTION BECAUSE IN HIS EYES ONLY GOD COULD INVENT THINGS HE WAS SIMPLY THE INSTRUMENT OF GOD'S WILL
AND WHAT WAS GOD'S WILL WELL GOD'S WILL WAS THAT THE AMOUNT OF SUFFERING IN ANY KIND OF WAR BE REDUCED TO AS SMALL AN AMOUNT AS POSSIBLE AND WHAT DID THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT DO WELL IT ALLOWED YOU TO DO THAT
IT ALLOWED YOU TO BOMB ONLY THOSE THINGS THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEEDED AND WANTED TO BOMB
PICKLE BARREL IT'S KNOWING HOW TO FIND THE PICKLE BARREL THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE HARDER PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING WARS OR
BOMBSIGHT IS THE HOLY GRAIL SO WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR WELL IT TURNS OUT IT'S NOT THE HOLY
THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT IS TAKEN ONTO A PLANE IT'S ESCORTED THERE BY SERIES OF ARMED GUARDS
BOMBS ON THIS 757 ACRE
CHEMICAL PLANT USING THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT WELL
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE BOMBS DO YOU THINK ACTUALLY LANDED INSIDE THE 700 ACRE PERIMETER OF THE PLANT
10 PERCENT
10 PERCENT
AND OF THOSE 10
NORDEN IS REALLY THE ONE WHO CRACKS THE CODE
AND HE COMES UP WITH THIS
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED DEVICE IT WEIGHS ABOUT 50 LBS
IT'S CALLED THE NORDEN MARK 15 BOMBSIGHT AND IT HAS ALL KINDS OF LEVERS AND BALL BEARINGS AND GADGETS AND GAUGES
AND HE MAKES THIS COMPLICATED THING AND WHAT HE ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DO IS HE MAKES THE BOMBARDIER
TAKE THIS PARTICULAR OBJECT
BACK IN NEW YORK NO ONE TOLD CARL NORDEN THAT HIS BOMBSIGHT WAS USED OVER HIROSHIMA HE WAS A COMMITTED CHRISTIAN HE THOUGHT HE HAD DESIGNED SOMETHING THAT WOULD REDUCE THE TOLL OF SUFFERING IN WAR IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS HEART
SOME STATIONARY TARGET IN THE FACE OF ALL KINDS OF WINDS AND CLOUD COVER AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER IMPEDIMENTS AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE MOVING UP
TO THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND BETWEEN THE WARS TRIED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND NEARLY EVERYBODY CAME UP SHORT
THE BOMBSIGHTS THAT WERE AVAILABLE WERE INCREDIBLY CRUDE
IS THAT IS IT BECAUSE THEIR WEAPONS WEREN'T ACCURATE OH NO THEY WERE BRILLIANTLY
THANK YOU IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO BE HERE I LAST DID A TED TALK I THINK ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO OR SO I TALKED ABOUT SPAGHETTI SAUCE
NOT DESCRIBED TO YOU A SUCCESS STORY I'VE DESCRIBED TO YOU THE OPPOSITE OF A SUCCESS STORY
AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH OUR INFATUATION WITH THE THINGS WE MAKE
WE THINK THE THINGS WE MAKE CAN SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BUT OUR PROBLEMS ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT
THE ISSUE ISN'T THE ACCURACY OF THE BOMBS YOU HAVE IT'S HOW YOU USE THE BOMBS YOU HAVE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHETHER YOU OUGHT TO USE BOMBS AT ALL
THERE'S A
POSTSCRIPT TO
THE NORDEN STORY OF CARL NORDEN AND HIS FABULOUS BOMBSIGHT
AND THAT IS ON AUGUST 6 1945
A B 29 BOMBER
CALLED THE ENOLA GAY FLEW OVER JAPAN
AND USING A NORDEN BOMBSIGHT DROPPED A VERY LARGE THERMONUCLEAR DEVICE ON THE CITY OF HIROSHIMA
AND AS WAS TYPICAL WITH THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT THE BOMB ACTUALLY MISSED ITS TARGET
IS HANDCUFFED TO ONE OF THE GUARDS IT'S NEVER ALLOWED TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED AND THERE'S A LITTLE INCENDIARY DEVICE INSIDE OF IT SO THAT IF THE PLANE EVER CRASHES IT WILL BE DESTROYED AND THERE'S NO WAY THE ENEMY CAN EVER GET THEIR HANDS ON IT
SMALL
EXPENSIVE EXQUISITE OBJECTS AND HE'S A SWISS ENGINEER
CARL AND I MEAN THAT IN ITS FULLEST SENSE OF THE WORD HE WEARS THREE PIECE SUITS AND
HE HAS A VERY VERY SMALL IMPORTANT MUSTACHE
AND HE IS DOMINEERING AND NARCISSISTIC AND
IN A TIME WHERE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REALLY REALLY SMART PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND SAYING THAT THEY'VE INVENTED GADGETS THAT WILL FOREVER CHANGE OUR WORLD THEY'VE INVENTED WEBSITES THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE FREE THEY'VE INVENTED SOME KIND OF THIS THING OR THIS THING OR THIS THING THAT WILL MAKE OUR WORLD FOREVER BETTER
IF YOU GO INTO THE MILITARY YOU'LL FIND LOTS OF CARL NORDENS AS WELL
WHAT HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE THERE ARE CLOUDS RIGHT IT NEEDS CLOUDLESS SKY TO BE REALLY ACCURATE WELL HOW MANY CLOUDLESS SKIES DO YOU THINK THERE WERE ABOVE CENTRAL EUROPE BETWEEN 1940 AND 1945
THE DRONE WELL IT IS THE GRANDSON OF THE NORDEN MARK 15 BOMBSIGHT IT IS THIS WEAPON OF DEVASTATING ACCURACY AND PRECISION
AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIX YEARS IN NORTHWEST PAKISTAN THE CIA HAS FLOWN HUNDREDS OF DRONE MISSILES AND IT'S USED THOSE DRONES TO KILL 2000 SUSPECTED PAKISTANI AND TALIBAN MILITANTS NOW WHAT IS THE ACCURACY OF THOSE DRONES WELL IT'S EXTRAORDINARY
WE THINK WE'RE NOW AT 95 PERCENT ACCURACY WHEN IT COMES TO DRONE STRIKES 95 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WE KILL NEED TO BE KILLED RIGHT THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RECORDS IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN WARFARE BUT
TURNS OUT
THAT CARL NORDEN AS A PROPER SWISS WAS VERY ENAMORED OF GERMAN ENGINEERS SO IN THE 1930S HE HIRED A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM INCLUDING A MAN NAMED HERMANN LONG
WHO IN 1938 GAVE A COMPLETE SET OF THE PLANS FOR THE NORDEN BOMBSIGHT TO THE NAZIS SO THEY HAD THEIR OWN NORDEN BOMBSIGHT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WAR WHICH ALSO BY THE WAY DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL
SIGHT THE TARGET BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE PLEXIGLAS CONE OF THE BOMBER
AND THEN THEY PLUG IN THE ALTITUDE OF THE PLANE THE SPEED OF THE PLANE THE SPEED OF THE WIND AND THE COORDINATES OF THE TARGET AND THE BOMBSIGHT WILL TELL HIM WHEN TO DROP THE BOMB
HE GOES TO THE FEDERAL POLYTECH IN ZURICH IN FACT ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES IS YOUNG MAN NAMED
BACK SOME HAPPY OR POSSIBLY SOME SLIGHTLY DISTURBING MEMORIES SO PHYSICS AND MARKETING
THE PHYSICS IS THAT THE BIGGER THE MASS OF AN OBJECT THE MORE FORCE IS NEEDED TO CHANGE ITS DIRECTION THE MARKETING IS THE BIGGER A BRAND THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO REPOSITION
I'VE CONVINCED YOU THAT PHYSICS CAN TEACH ALL OF US EVEN IN THE WORLD OF MARKETING SOMETHING SPECIAL THANK YOU
ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON ACCOMPANIED SHOPS IN SUPERMARKETS WHO STUFF THEIR TROLLEYS FULL OF FRESH GREEN VEGETABLES AND FRUIT BUT DON'T SHOP LIKE THAT ANY OTHER DAY AND
ABOUT THE GROUP OF MOMS WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT THEIR WONDERFUL CHILDREN IN FOCUS GROUP AND ALMOST NONE OF THEM BUY LOTS OF JUNK FOOD AND YET MCDONALD'S SELLS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BURGERS EVERY
IT MAKES THIS DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY A
DEMOCRATIZING FORCE WHICH IS ULTIMATELY GOOD FOR YOUR BRAND
SO THE LESSON FROM PHYSICS IS THAT ENTROPY WILL ALWAYS INCREASE IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL LAW THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS THAT YOUR BRAND IS MORE DISPERSED YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT SO EMBRACE IT AND FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH IT
IT'S THE SAME WITH BRANDS THE MORE MASSIVE A BRAND THE MORE BAGGAGE IT HAS THE MORE FORCE IS NEEDED TO CHANGE ITS POSITIONING AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ARTHUR ANDERSEN CHOSE TO LAUNCH
THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CLAIM IN SURVEYS TO REGULARLY LOOK FOR PORN ON THE WEB IT'S VERY FEW YET AT GOOGLE WE KNOW IT'S THE NUMBER ONE SEARCHED FOR CATEGORY
AND THERE ARE PARALLELS FOR MARKETING YOU CAN INVEST FOR A LONG TIME IN A BRAND BUT A SINGLE CONTRARY OBSERVATION OF THAT POSITIONING WILL DESTROY CONSUMERS' BELIEF
GATHER MORE AND MORE DATA AROUND A HYPOTHESIS OR A POSITIONING AND IT WILL STRENGTHEN IT BUT IT WILL NOT CONCLUSIVELY PROVE IT AND ONLY ONE CONTRARY DATA POINT CAN BLOW YOUR THEORY OUT OF THE
LUCKILY THE SCIENCE NO SORRY THE MARKETING IS GETTING EASIER LUCKILY WITH NOW BETTER POINT OF SALE TRACKING MORE DIGITAL MEDIA CONSUMPTION YOU CAN MEASURE MORE WHAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY DO RATHER THAN WHAT THEY SAY THEY DO
SAYS THAT ENTROPY WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE DISORDER OF A SYSTEM WILL ALWAYS
THAT IF YOU'VE GOT AN ELEMENTARY PARTICLE AND YOU SHINE A LIGHT ON IT THEN THE PHOTON OF LIGHT HAS MOMENTUM WHICH KNOCKS THE PARTICLE SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS BEFORE YOU LOOKED AT IT
ABOUT A PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS OR MAYBE NEW BRANDS FOR NEW VENTURES NOW WHO REMEMBERS
{NS} SO I WORK IN MARKETING WHICH I LOVE BUT MY FIRST PASSION WAS PHYSICS A PASSION BROUGHT TO ME BY A WONDERFUL SCHOOL TEACHER WHEN I HAD A LITTLE LESS GRAY HAIR
PHYSICS IS YOU CAN NEVER ACCURATELY AND EXACTLY MEASURE A PARTICLE
BECAUSE THE OBSERVATION CHANGES IT
THE MARKETING IS THE MESSAGE FOR MARKETING IS
THAT TRY TO MEASURE WHAT CONSUMERS ACTUALLY DO RATHER THAN WHAT THEY SAY THEY'LL DO OR ANTICIPATE THEY'LL DO
PARTICLE A LARGER MASS IT REQUIRES MORE FORCE TO CHANGE ITS
ACTUALLY SAW HIM SPEAK HE DID A GOOD JOB BUT WHILE THIS MAY BE UNSETTLING FOR MARKETERS IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD THING THIS DISTRIBUTION OF BRAND ENERGY GETS YOUR BRAND CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE MORE IN WITH THE PEOPLE
THE PHYSICS IS THAT YOU CANNOT PROVE A HYPOTHESIS BUT IT'S EASY TO DISPROVE IT ANY HYPOTHESIS IS SHAKY AND THE MARKETING IS THAT NOT MATTER HOW MUCH YOU'VE INVESTED IN YOUR BRAND ONE BAD WEEK CAN UNDERMINE DECADES OF GOOD
AND PUT IT OUT THERE LIKE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY DID EARLIER THIS YEAR WITH THEIR ELECTION POSTER BUT THEN YOU LOSE CONTROL OF IT WITH THE KIND OF DIGITAL COMMENT
BY MEASURING IT THE ACT OF MEASUREMENT CHANGES IT THE ACT OF OBSERVATION CHANGES IT IT'S THE SAME IN MARKETING SO WITH THE ACT OF OBSERVING CONSUMERS CHANGES THEIR BEHAVIOR
NOT THE DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY THAT LOT OF PEOPLE GO WITH IS APPROPRIATE NOVELTY FOR SOMETHING TO BE APPROPRIATE IT HAS TO BE REALISTIC SO
OF THIS IS THAT YOU SHOULD GO FOR WALK BEFORE YOUR NEXT BIG MEETING AND JUST
WRITE IT DOWN SO JUST SPEAK AS MANY AS YOU CAN RECORD THEM AND THINK ABOUT THEM LATER
RIGHT BECAUSE THE ACT OF WRITING YOUR IDEA DOWN IS ALREADY A FILTER YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE IS THIS GOOD ENOUGH TO WRITE DOWN AND
DID THE TEST TWICE WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTS THREE GROUPS THE FIRST GROUP SAT FIRST AND THEN SAT AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TEST
THE SECOND GROUP
SAT FIRST AND THEN DID THE SECOND TEST WHILE WALKING ON A TREADMILL
THE THIRD GROUP AND THIS IS INTERESTING
UP ON A BREAK RIGHT NOW SO I HAVE AN IDEA WHY DON'T YOU GRAB A LEASH AND TAKE YOUR THOUGHTS FOR A WALK THANK YOU
TO STOP RUNNING SO {LG} BUT IF RUNNING FOR YOU
POPS OUT OF THE SHAMPOO BOTTLE THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AHEAD OF TIME THEY'RE INTENTIONALLY THINKING ABOUT BRAINSTORMING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE WALK
MAYBE THAT'S SORT OF INTERESTING KIND OF NEW BUT IS IT CREATIVE
ONE PERSON SAID THIS {LG} AND IT'S A CREATIVE IDEA BECAUSE IT'S APPROPRIATE AND IT'S NOVEL
ONE KEY OF CREATIVITY IS TO NOT LOCK ON THAT FIRST IDEA KEEP GOING
HOWEVER ONLY ONE PERSON SAID THIS
AND
THEN SHE GOES HOW DO YOU DO THE BACKING TRACKS I WAS LIKE WELL I AM DOING THEM AS I AM GOING I AM JUST IMPROVISING AND RECORDING THEM SHE GOES OKAY SO WHERE DO YOU DO YOUR BACKING TRACKS SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME SO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT SO I AM
GOING TO IMPROVISE RIGHT HERE
I'M
PALNIK
I PERFORM AROUND THE COUNTRY AROUND
COLUMBUS AROUND
OHIO
AND
I DO KIND OF A ONE MAN BAND
WE'LL GET TO THAT IN SECOND
I WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DANCE HERE I AM OBVIOUSLY NOT A DANCER ALTHOUGH THIS PHYSIQUE IS
WHERE IT'S AT
YOU GUYS LIKE
THAT
SO IN THE
ABOUT THIS SONG IS THE INTERTWINING AND INTERMINGLING OF
ANCIENT AFRICAN RHYTHMS
AND MODERN POP
IT'S LIKE I'LL HAVE FOUR SLICES OF THAT LIKE THAT IS IT SPEAKS TO ME RIGHT IT IS MY FAVOURITE KIND OF MUSIC
AND
IT IS
JUST WHAT I LOVE TO DO OKAY I'M
GOING TO PLAY A SONG I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY BY MYSELF AND I COULDN'T
OKAY HERE
WE GO THIS
ACCURATE IT'S ALSO WRONG BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE MILLENIALS WHO ARE LEAST ENGAGED IT'S A NEW LIFE STAGE CALLED EMERGING ADULTHOOD AND THAT'S WHAT'S UNEXPECTED THIS ONE MY FRIENDS IS A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE IF IT'S THE MILLENNIALS THEY'RE A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED
IF IT'S LIFE STAGE IT'S A CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND ADAPT TO AND UNDERSTANDING THAT MAKES WORKING TOGETHER EASIER AND IT MAKES BEING A FATHER EASIER
NOW
EMERGING ADULTHOOD IS
AND SHE IS GOING INTO MEDICINE WHICH MEANS HER NEXT EIGHT YEARS ARE PREPLANNED FOR
IN CHRISTIAN EDUCATION AND HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND AND HE'S NOW GOING TO BE A CHILDREN'S MINISTER
SWITCHES FROM BUSINESS TO HIS MINOR COMPLETELY BECAUSE HE HAS CHOICES AND HIS MOTHER'S PUSHING HIM TOWARD CHOICES
MORE THAN THAT HE HAS BAD DYSLEXIA
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HE WOULD'VE HAD NO CHOICES EXCEPT LABORER
NOW
DON'T GET ME STARTED I THINK LABORERS ARE AMAZINGLY VALUABLE AND HONORABLE WORK
MIKE ROWE AND THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN TO GIVE HONOR TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LABORERS IN DIRTY JOBS
YOU GRADUATE WITH A BUSINESS DEGREE YOU MAKE 45000 DOLLARS AS A SALESMAN YOU GRADUATE WITH AN APPRENTICESHIP AND ARE ABLE TO READ A BLUEPRINT AND YOU'RE A WELDER YOU START AT 75000 DOLLARS WE NEED TO GET OFF OF THIS NOT HONORING LABORERS
STUFF
A DAUGHTER BUT SHE DOESN'T FACE FREEDOM CHANGE AND CHOICE BECAUSE SHE'S ONLY A
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGE HERE HERE'S WHAT MY BEST FRIEND SAID TO HIM A COO OF A
MAX IS FREAKING OUT BECAUSE HE HAS THREE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES MAX YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER IT'S YOUR FIRST JOB CHILL DUDE I DON'T KNOW
TO US
WHY WOULD I NOT DO IT NOW I DON'T HAVE THE ENTANGLEMENTS OF LATER LIFE
EARLY ADULTHOOD
I DON'T NEED THE MONEY WE COULD PUT IT ON THE CREDIT CARD AND YOU'LL LET US MOVE BACK IN WITH YOU WON'T YOU
YES ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE MILLENNIALS LIVES WITH THEIR PARENTS SOME TIME IN THEIR 20S AND THAT ALLOWS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FREEDOM
THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO HER BUT TO MY THREE BUSINESS MAJOR BOYS IT APPLIES TO COMPLETELY AND THEY ILLUSTRATE THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS OR DIMENSIONS OF EMERGING ADULTHOOD FREEDOM
CHOICE AND CHANGE
MY SON BART IS 26
WHEN HE WAS 22 HE GRADUATED WITH TWO DEGREES
GOT MARRIED THREE MONTHS LATER AND HEADED OFF TO A VERY RISKY START UP ALL START UPS ARE RISKY BUT THIS WAS TWICE AS RISKY AS THE AVERAGE START UP HIS MOTHER SAID NO YOU HAVE 500 DOLLARS TO YOUR NAME AND A NEW BRIDE
HE SAID MY NEW BRIDE CAN WORK SHE CAN GET INTO ANY GRAD SCHOOL WITH HER GRADES WE'RE FINE AND WE BOTH WANT TO LIVE IN RHODE ISLAND
SO THEY MOVED TO RHODE ISLAND WHICH HAS GREAT LOBSTER ROLLS I HAVE TO TELL YOU AFTER LIVING IN CHICAGO AMAZING LOBSTER ROLLS GO IGGY'S SO THEY LIVE OUT THERE THEY'RE QUITE HAPPY THEY'RE DIRT POOR THEY HAVE HAND ME DOWN FURNITURE IN THE BACK OF A U HAUL AND HE JUST RESIGNED LAST WEDNESDAY HE RAN OUT OF MONEY
HALF OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MILLENNIALS IS WRONG
HALF THE FRUSTRATIONS BUSINESS HAVE ABOUT THE YOUNGER MILLENNIAL EMPLOYEES IS WRONG HALF OF THE FRUSTRATIONS MILLENNIALS HAVE ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH THE OLDER GENERATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED OR WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY IS WRONG HALF THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT FAMILIES HAVE
WITH THEIR 20 SOMETHINGS
IS WRONG
AREN'T LOYAL IT'S A NEW LIFE STAGE I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE NOT ENGAGED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 28 WITH A MORTGAGE AND A BABY WE ALL JUST NEED TO LIKE SLOW IT DOWN A BIT BECAUSE IF WE THINK IT'S A GENERATIONAL CHARACTERISTIC WE THINK WE NEED TO FIX THEM IF WE THINK IT'S A LIFE STAGE ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS UNDERSTAND IT AND SHUT UP AND LISTEN
TURNING YOUR NOSE UP AT THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE I FIND YOU AND BRING ME SOME GRANDCHILDREN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
BOSSES ARE HOW DO WE MOTIVATE THEM THEY'RE NOT ENGAGED
YES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THEIR CAREER FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
HOW DO WE KEEP THEM FROM LEAVING SIMPLE THE RESEARCH IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR A MORTGAGE AND
A MINOR IN THEOLOGY AND CHURCH ADMINISTRATION
HE WAS GOING TO GET A BUSINESS JOB LAST YEAR WHEN HE GRADUATES HIS MOTHER SAYS
GO DO THIS RESIDENCY IT'S VERY SELECTIVE TRY IT
HE GETS IN
HE IS A RESIDENT IN A HUGE CHURCH IN PHOENIX HE FINISHES IN THREE WEEKS WITH A
KNOW IT'S THERE BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE ON SURVEYS WHO ARE OVER 30 WHEN DOES ADULTHOOD BEGIN FULL ADULTHOOD THEY SAY 28
27 WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE UNDER 30 WHEN DOES FULL ADULTHOOD BEGIN
27 28 IT'S THE ONE THING WE ALL AGREE ON WE ALL SEE IT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A NAME FOR IT PARENTS SAY THIS WHEN I WAS 25 I HAD A MORTGAGE AND A KID YOU NEED TO SETTLE DOWN QUIT
START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IT SAYS HELLO CAN YOU
MADE FOR THE CONVERSATION A 2010 STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LEARNS THAT HAVING
BUT THE BIGGEST RESPONSIBILITY RELIES WITH YOU WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WILL YOU
AND THERE ARE THREE MAJOR TRENDS THAT ARE DRIVING THIS THE FIRST TREND IS SMARTPHONE ADOPTION
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU WHO RECENTLY CALLED THE NUMBER OF YOUR BANK
VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THEY DO WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GATHER AND WHAT THEIR COMMERCIAL INTENTIONS
MY FIRST ONLINE CONVERSATION AND IT MADE A DEEP DEEP IMPRESSION ON ME AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT
OF THIS
INTERFACE IS THAT IT ASKING QUESTIONS AND GIVING ANSWERS THE WHOLE INFORMATION EXCHANGE GETS REALLY PERSONAL
THIS ALLOWS MACHINES
TO CREATE
A UNIQUE PERSONAL PROFILE OF EVERY HUMAN CONNECTED
CONVERSATION THAN WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR MOTHER AT HOME THIS IS
CONTACT IS ESSENTIAL FOR MACHINE BECAUSE WORDS CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT
NOW MACHINES HAVE THE ABILITY TO STORE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF CONVERSATIONS
YOUR KIDS YOUR KIDS HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL ASSISTANT AS WELL IT HELPS WITH THEM WITH THEIR HOMEWORK AND TEACHES THEM ALL KINDS OF PRACTICAL STUFF LIKE BRUSHING THEIR TEETH
THIS PROVES THAT THE CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACE IS THE MOST
THE SAME AFFECT ON YOUR NEURAL FUNCTIONS AS INTENSIVE BRAIN TRAINING DOES ANOTHER
PROMISE ME YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR FRIENDS AROUND YOU PLEASE PROMISE ME YOU KEEP LOOKING AFTER EACH OTHER
AND I JUST BOUGHT MY FIRST 14K4 MODEM THE INTERNET IS JUST A BLACK SCREEN AND A BLINKING CURSOR
THAT ACCESSIBLE EVERYWHERE ANYTIME ANYPLACE
THAT WAS NOT THE COMPUTER BUT IT WAS A PERSON TALKING TO ME TWENTY MINUTES LATER I
IT CAN SOLVE BIG ISSUES LIKE LONELINESS BUT AT THE SAME
DETERMINE IF YOU ARE WITH FRIENDS WITH FAMILIES OR COLLEAGUES SO
BUT I FORESEE THAT THE DIFFERENCES WILL GET SMALLER ON THE SOCIAL LEVEL
OF THAT GREW IMMENSELY AND TODAY POPULAR MESSAGING
I'M TERRIFIED THE COMPUTER JUST SPOKE TO ME THIS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE
THE R IN CDCR SOME WOULD ARGUE
AND GET MOVING AHEAD
SO THAT'S JUST WHAT WE INTEND TO DO WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED BRINGING UP A LOT OF OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS
IRONWOOD IN PARTICULAR IS THE FIRST CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON TO HAVE ONLINE COLLEGE COURSES
AND YOU CAN LOOK IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND YOU CAN LOOK IN YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SEE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN BUT YOU WANT TO JUST GLANCE AT WHERE YOU'VE BEEN BECAUSE IF YOU FOCUS YOUR SIGHTS ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS YOU'RE GOING TO CRASH AND BURN
THE R BACK TO CDCR SO WELCOME AND THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION
WE HAVE OVER NINE VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTION
WE ALSO HAVE OVER 700 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN COLLEGE COURSES HERE
AND WE HAVE OVER 15 CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS OFFERED
IRONWOOD STATE PRISON OF COURSE FOR THIS AMAZING
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY THAT THE R IS ABOUT REHABILITATION AND THE R IS ABOUT REBUILDING OUR REHABILITATION EFFORTS AND SO THAT IS GOING TO BE OUR PATH FORWARD HAS ANYBODY HEARD OF
DECADE AGO
THAT IT STOOD FOR REORGANIZATION
AND THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT WE DID BLOWING UP BOXES REORGING A LOT OF OUR OPERATIONS
AND THEN SOME WOULD SAY THAT THE R STOOD FOR
REDUCTIONS WE TOOK A LOT OF BUDGET REDUCTIONS WE CUT A LOT OF PROGRAMS WE LAID OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE DUE TO THE BUDGET CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA
GO LIMP EVAPORATE INCINERATE DISINTEGRATE COMBUST LIQUIFY AND DISAPPEAR
YOUR WISDOM PLEASE PROTECT THIS GIRL PROTECT HER PROTECT HER IN YOUR MERCY IN YOUR WISDOM
AND THEN THEY TOOK HIM
NO ONE WOULD SAY WHAT AT LEAST ONE LIBRARIAN ALREADY KNEW
SHE HAD TRIED
SHE HAD PRESSED HIS CHEST
BLOWN AIR INTO HIS TINY MOUTH
SHE WAS BACK INSIDE THE LIBRARY A WOMAN TOLD ME IN THE BATHROOM
THROWING UP
FOR ME POETRY IS A WAY OF ACUTELY TARGETING A SENTIMENT SKEWERING AN EMOTION ALMOST AND REALLY TRYING TO TELL
LIKE I SAID THE TRUTH AND THE WHOLE TRUTH AS I EXPERIENCED IT IN THE MOMENT TO COMPLETE
THE STORY TO COMPLETE
AN ENTIRE EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF JUST WHO WAS THERE AND WHAT HAPPENED
POETRY IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN DOING SINCE I WAS REALLY LITTLE I REMEMBER MY FIRST POEM I WROTE IN GREEN CRAYON I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY I REMEMBER THIS ON A PIECE OF CONSTRUCTION PAPER AND IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL ABOUT BIRDS AND TREES AND OTHER THINGS THAT EIGHT YEAR OLDS WRITE ABOUT BECAUSE POETRY IS NON LINEAR WAY OF
THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD PRAYING PRAYING TO GOD ENTREATING THE
HAIR
YOUR LONG ROAD
YOUR MOTHER'S GRIEF
AND THE DRIVER
TO YOUR MOTHER
HOW HE HELD HER HOW HE CRIED
HOW HE LOOKED HER IN THE EYE AND APOLOGIZED
AND THE ROCKING
LIKE A RAFT
I COULD NOT TURN OFF THE BEAUTY NO MATTER HOW SHATTERED THE LIGHT YOUR
{NS} {NS} YOUR BROTHER WAS LYING DEAD IN THE STREET AND YOU STOOD ON THE SIDEWALK SCREAMING
GLANCING ENTRANCING LIGHT THE LIGHT YOUR BROTHER RAN INTO
THE LAST LIGHT THE ONLY LIGHT THAT MATTERED
AS IT SHATTERED
AS FIRST THE TRUCK AND THEN THE TRAILER
JOLTED BUMPED TOOK HOLD
WOULD NOT LET GO
30 FEET A STRIPE OF RUBBER ENDING IN THE GUTTER WHERE NOW THE PARAMEDICS BENT OVER THE BODY OF YOUR BROTHER
I FELT MYSELF SPINNING WITH THE ROTATING LIGHTS
HEARING CRIES YET SEEING BEAUTY
BEAUTY IN THE WAY THE FOUR MEN LIFTED YOUR MOTHER DRAGGING HER TO THE GRASS AS THOUGH SHE'D BEEN DEBONED
BEAUTY IN A WOMAN HER HAND
OF US WERE IN IT TOGETHER BROKEN AND WEATHERED ALIVE THANK YOU
YOU DON'T KNOW ME I AM ON THE CORNER OF MISSISSIPPI AND TEJON I AM WITH YOUR DAUGHTER AND SHE IS FINE BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCIDENT
LIFE WAS SO HARD AND
I FELT
DISAPPOINTED
I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHY DID HAVE TO BE
IN BANGKOK
I THOUGHT
ABOUT WHEN I WAS A KID NOBODY WORKED EIGHT HOURS PER DAY EVERYBODY WORKED TWO HOURS
TWO MONTHS A YEAR
PLANTING RICE ONE MONTH AND HARVESTING THE RICE ANOTHER MONTH
THE REST IS FREE TIME TEN MONTHS OF FREE TIME
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE HAVE SO MANY FESTIVALS IN THAILAND EVERY MONTH THEY HAVE FESTIVAL
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH FREE TIME AND
THEN IN THE DAYTIME EVERYONE EVEN TAKES A NAP
EVEN NOW IN LAOS GO TO LAOS IF
YOU CAN PEOPLE TAKE A NAP AFTER LUNCH
AND AFTER THEY WAKE UP THEY JUST GOSSIP HOW'S YOUR SON IN LAW HOW'S YOUR
WIFE DAUGHTER IN LAW
HAVE A HOUSE BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEVERER THAN ME WHO ARE NUMBER ONE IN THE CLASS EVERY
YEAR THEY GET A GOOD JOB BUT THEY NEED TO WORK MORE THAN 30 YEARS TO HAVE A HOUSE
BUT ME WHO CANNOT FINISH UNIVERSITY HOW COULD I HAVE A HOUSE
THE MOST EXPENSIVE PANTS CANNOT CHANGE MY LIFE
I FELT LIKE I'M SO CRAZY WHY DID I HAVE TO BUY THEM
SPEND ONE MONTH TO HAVE A PAIR OF PANTS
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ME I STARTED TO THINK MORE
ABOUT THAT WHY DO WE NEED TO FOLLOW FASHION
BECAUSE WHEN WE FOLLOW FASHION WE NEVER CATCH UP WITH IT BECAUSE WE FOLLOW IT
SO DON'T FOLLOW IT JUST STAY HERE USE WHAT YOU HAVE SO AFTER
SO MY LIFE IS EASY AND LIGHT NOW THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME
PEOPLE CAN THINK WHATEVER THEY WANT I CANNOT MANAGE ANYTHING OUTSIDE MYSELF
WHAT I CAN DO IS
CHANGE MY MIND MANAGE MY MIND
NOW MY MIND IS LIGHT AND EASY THAT'S ENOUGH IF ANYBODY WANTS
TO HAVE A CHOICE
YOU CAN HAVE A CHOICE THE
CHOICE TO BE EASY OR TO BE HARD
I HAVE MORE THAN 30 VARIETIES OF VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN
SO SIX PEOPLE CANNOT EAT ALL OF IT
WE HAVE A SURPLUS TO SELL IN THE MARKET WE CAN MAKE SOME INCOME TOO
SO I FEEL LIKE
IT'S EASY WHY DID I HAVE TO BE IN BANGKOK FOR SEVEN YEARS
WORKING HARD AND THEN NOT
I'M WRONG
SO
I FEEL MORE FREE WHEN I THINK LIKE THIS
AND THE LAST THING IS
WHEN I GET SICK WHAT WILL I DO
I REALLY WORRIED IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THEN I HAD NO MONEY BUT
I
STARTED TO CONTEMPLATE MORE
NORMALLY SICKNESS IS A NORMAL THING IT'S NOT A BAD THING
SICKNESS IS SOMETHING TO REMIND US THAT WE DID SOMETHING WRONG IN OUR LIVES THAT'S WHY WE GOT SICK
SO WHEN I GET SICK I NEED TO STOP AND COME BACK TO MYSELF
AND THINK ABOUT
IT WHAT
I DID WAS WRONG
AROUND US
EVERYTHING IS SO HARD TO GET
I FEEL LIKE NOW IS THE MOST UNCIVILIZED ERA OF HUMANS ON THIS EARTH
WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO FINISH
UNIVERSITY HAVE SO MANY UNIVERSITIES ON THE EARTH
HAVE SO MANY CLEVER PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH
BUT
LIFE IS HARDER AND HARDER
WE MAKE IT HARD FOR WHOM
WE WORK HARD FOR WHOM RIGHT NOW
AND LEARN TO BE TOGETHER BECAUSE
WE WERE TAUGHT TO DISCONNECT OURSELVES FROM EVERYTHING ELSE
TO BE INDEPENDENT SO WE CAN RELY ON THE MONEY ONLY WE DON'T NEED TO RELY ON EACH OTHER BUT NOW TO BE HAPPY WE NEED TO COME BACK TO CONNECT TO OURSELVES AGAIN TO CONNECT TO OTHER PEOPLE
TO CONNECT OUR MIND AND BODY TOGETHER AGAIN
SO WE CAN BE HAPPY
LIFE IS EASY AND FROM BEGINNING UNTIL NOW WHAT I LEARNED IS THE FOUR BASIC NEEDS FOOD HOUSE CLOTHES AND MEDICINE MUST BE CHEAP AND EASY FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S THE CIVILIZATION BUT IF YOU MAKE THESE FOUR THINGS HARD AND VERY HARD FOR MANY PEOPLE TO GET THAT'S UNCIVILIZED
SO NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT
I COULD NOT DO ANYTHING BUT NOW I FEEL VERY FREE LIKE I'M A UNIQUE PERSON ON THIS EARTH NOBODY LIKE ME I DON'T NEED TO MAKE MYSELF LIKE ANYBODY ELSE I'M THE NUMBER ONE
SO THINGS LIKE THIS MAKE IT EASY VERY LIGHT
AND AFTER THAT
I STARTED
TO
THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN I WAS IN BANGKOK I FELT VERY
DARK IN MY LIFE
I STARTED TO THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE MAYBE THOUGHT LIKE ME AT THE TIME
SO WE STARTED A PLACE CALLED PUN PUN
IN CHIANG MAI THE MAIN AIM IS JUST SAVING SEED
TO COLLECT SEED BECAUSE SEED IS FOOD FOOD IS LIFE IF THERE IS NO SEED
NO LIFE NO SEED NO FREEDOM NO SEED NO HAPPINESS
BECAUSE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON SOMEBODY ELSE
CAN BUILD A HOUSE THE KIDS 13 YEARS OLD AT THE SCHOOL THEY MAKE
AND IN THREE MONTHS I GOT A HOUSE
AND ANOTHER FRIEND WHO'S THE MOST CLEVER IN THE CLASS
HE SPENT THREE MONTHS
TO BUILD HIS HOUSE TOO BUT HE HAD TO BE IN DEBT HE HAD TO PAY FOR HIS DEBT FOR 30 YEARS
SO COMPARED TO HIM I HAVE
29 YEARS AND
ME IF YOU LEARN
TO BE AN ARCHITECT OR ENGINEER THAT MEANS YOU RUIN MORE
THE MORE THESE PEOPLE WORK THE MOUNTAIN WILL BE DESTROYED MORE
AND A GOOD LAND IN CHAO PRAYA BASIN WILL BE COVERED WITH CONCRETE MORE AND MORE
WE DESTROY MORE IF WE GO TO
AGRICULTURE FACULTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT MEANS WE LEARN HOW TO
POISON TO POISON THE LAND THE WATER AND LEARN TO DESTROY EVERYTHING
I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING WE DO IS SO COMPLICATED SO HARD WE JUST MAKE EVERYTHING HARD
NO FOOD
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAVE SEED THAT'S WHY WE FOCUS ON SAVING SEED THAT'S THE MAIN THING IN PUN PUN
AND THE SECOND THING IS IT
IS THE LEARNING CENTER
WE WANT TO HAVE A CENTER FOR OURSELVES TO LEARN LEARN HOW TO MAKE LIFE EASY BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT TO MAKE LIFE COMPLICATED AND HARD ALL THE TIME
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT EASY
IT'S EASY
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT EASY ANYMORE
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS MAKE IT COMPLICATED AND NOW
WE START TO
AND
WENT BACK HOME
WHEN I WENT BACK HOME I STARTED
TO LIVE LIKE I REMEMBER LIKE WHEN I WAS A KID
I STARTED TO WORK TWO MONTHS YEAR
I GOT FOUR TONS OF RICE
AND THE WHOLE FAMILY SIX PEOPLE WE EAT LESS THAN HALF A
BUT PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AS THE ABNORMAL ONE {LG} A CRAZY PERSON BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY FAULT IT'S THEIR FAULT THEY THINK LIKE THAT
I FEEL LIKE IT'S WRONG
IT'S NOT NORMAL SO I JUST WANT TO COME BACK TO NORMAL TO BE A NORMAL PERSON
TO BE EQUAL TO ANIMALS
THE BIRDS
MAKE A NEST IN ONE OR TWO DAYS
THE RATS DIG A HOLE IN ONE NIGHT
SO THAT'S WRONG
WHY DO WE DESTROY OUR SPIRIT WHY DO WE DESTROY OUR ABILITY THAT MUCH
SO I FEEL THAT
IT'S ENOUGH FOR ME TO LIVE IN THE NORMAL WAY IN THE ABNORMAL WAY SO NOW I TRY TO BE
THE KIDS CAN MAKE A HOUSE A VERY OLD NUN CAN BUILD A HUT FOR HERSELF MANY PEOPLE CAN BUILD A HOUSE SO IT'S
PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF TIME
BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF TIME
THEY HAVE TIME TO BE WITH THEMSELVES
AND WHEN THEY HAVE TIME TO BE WITH THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TIME TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES
WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES
THEY CAN SEE
WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR LIFE
SO MANY PEOPLE SEE THAT THEY WANT HAPPINESS
THEY WANT LOVE
THEY WANT TO ENJOY THEIR LIFE
SO PEOPLE SEE A LOT OF BEAUTY IN THEIR LIFE
SO THEY EXPRESS THAT BEAUTY IN MANY WAYS
AND AS THEY QUIT MEN QUIT
CUPID IS IN TROUBLE
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO CALL TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
NO THE ANSWER IS MORE OBVIOUS THAN GHOSTBUSTERS
YOU CALL AN ECONOMIST
DON'T LAUGH YOU CALL AN ECONOMIST
COM DID FOR MEN SO WHO IS THE BRILLIANT GUY BEHIND THE CONDITIONAL PRICE OFFER
FROM UP NORTH THEIR CHIEF COMPETITOR OR WOULD BE COMPETITOR MICROSOFT THEY WANTED THEIR OWN HAL VARIAN AND THEY GOT HER THIS IS SUSAN
CURSE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT WON HIM THE NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS IN 1996
WELL NOW YOU'RE ERIC SCHMIDT YOU THINK WELL ECONOMISTS THEY MAY BE ABLE TO HELP GOOGLE SO HE PERSUADES HAL VARIAN TO LEAVE HIS TENURED POSITION AT BERKELEY AND JOIN GOOGLE AS ITS FIRST CHIEF ECONOMIST
VARIAN THEN GOES ON TO HIRE AN ARMY OF STATISTICIANS AND ECONOMISTS
WHO HELPED REFINE THE ONLINE AD AUCTION PROCESS
AND ALSO DEVELOP OTHER SERVICES FOR THE MOUNTAIN VIEW GIANT
THE KEY TO PRICELINE WAS NOT THEIR GREAT ADVERTISING
IT WASN'T THE FACT THAT YOU COULD DO SEARCHES ONLINE
NO THE REAL KEY TO PRICELINE SUCCESS BY THE WAY IT'S A 60 BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY MARKET CAP TODAY
THE REAL KEY IS THEY MAKE YOU THIS PROPOSITION
THEY SAY THAT IF YOU
BID A PARTICULAR PRICE FOR A HOTEL ROOM OR A FLIGHT
AND PRICELINE DECIDES TO ACCEPT IT
YOU'RE BOUND TO PAY IT
I HAVE A THIRD EXAMPLE IT'S BIGGER THAN THE FIRST TWO
IT'S THE ENTIRE BUSINESS OF WEB RETAILING
IT'S A 300 BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE AND YOU ALL KNOW THE POSTER CHILD OF WEB RETAILING IT'S AMAZON COM
NOW MANY OF YOU MAY THINK THAT AMAZON'S SUCCESS IS DUE TO ITS FANTASTIC SYSTEM OF WAREHOUSING
AND INVENTORY CONTROL
IT'S ABLE TO BASICALLY SEND OUT ALL THAT STUFF THAT YOU ORDER ONLINE BUT
YOU KNOW AMAZON AND OTHER WEB RETAILERS WOULD NOT BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY ARE WITHOUT A HIGHLY FLEXIBLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY WOULD DELIVER ALL THAT STUFF
AND GUESS WHO HELPED BRING
ECONOMIC THINKING HAS REVOLUTIONIZED SPORTS
YOU KNOW IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER I'VE HAD A GOOD FORTUNE
TO MEET MANY MANY PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS WORLD
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE TOO MANY OF THEM
HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ECONOMISTS
EXAMPLE
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERNET
UNLESS YOU WANT TO COUNT THE 32 MILLION PEOPLE WHO PLAY SOME FORM OF ONLINE FANTASY SPORTS
I MENTIONED SPORTS BECAUSE I'M A SPORTS NUT
AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT MONEYBALL
I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE IT'S BASED ON A BOOK YES GO AHEAD AND APPLAUD
FANTASTIC BOOK
COULDN'T DELIVER MERCHANDISE MORE THAN 20 MILES AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT AT WHICH THE MERCHANDISE LANDED
THIS RULE WAS OBVIOUSLY IN PLACE TO PROTECT OTHER TRUCKERS FROM COMPETITION WHICH OF COURSE WAS THE WHOLE POINT
OF AIRLINE AND TRUCKING REGULATION IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT'S WHY ECONOMISTS LONG OPPOSED IT
BUT THEY ALSO OPPOSED IT FOR ANOTHER REASON
THERE LOTS OF AIRLINES AND TRUCKING FIRMS
THEY'RE NOT NATURAL MONOPOLIES IN THE SAME WAY THAT A LOCAL UTILITY IS THAT NEEDS REGULATION IN ORDER TO PREVENT PRICE GOUGING
NO AIRLINES AND TRUCKS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN REGULATED
AND THREE OF THE ECONOMISTS WHO WERE MOST INSISTENT ABOUT
HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE A DATE AND CONCEIVABLY FOR YOU TO HAVE MET YOUR SPOUSE I THINK ECONOMISTS DESERVE SOME RESPECT {LG}
THEY FEARED THAT THE ADVERTISERS WOULD BID A VERY LOW PRICE AND THEN INCREMENTALLY RAISED THEIR PRICES JUST A LITTLE BIT AND KEEP THE AUCTIONS GOING FOREVER AND IF THIS HAPPENED AND A LOT OF SEARCHES WERE ALSO GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME THE WHOLE SITE WOULD CRASH
SO AS AN ENGINEERING SOLUTION THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
THAT THE WINNING
AUCTION OR THE WINNING PLACEMENT
WILL BE THE PRICE THE SECOND HIGHEST PRICE THAT WAS BID PLUS ONE PENNY THIS WOULD CUT OFF THE AUCTIONS
REALLY SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS AND IN THE PROCESS ALSO SOLVE
ANOTHER PROBLEM CALLED THE WINNER'S
GOOGLE WAS LAUNCHED
ONLINE ADVERTISING WAS IN ITS INFANCY AND GOOGLE BELIEVE IT OR NOT WENT DOOR TO DOOR ADVERTISER TO ADVERTISER TRYING TO GET THEM TO PLACE AN AD NEXT TO SEARCH TERM
HIGHLY LABORIOUS YOU QUICKLY CAN SEE THIS IS NOT GOING TO SCALE AS THE NUMBER OF SEARCHES EXPLODED ON GOOGLE
AND SO THE FOUNDERS OF GOOGLE ASKED TWO YOUNG ENGINEERS
ERIC VEACH AND SALAR KAMANGAR TO COME UP WITH AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM
THAT WOULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
THERE IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A JOKE
BUT I REALLY WANT IT TO BE THE INTRODUCTION TO THE NOTION OF ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY
AND YOU'LL SEE WHY IN A MINUTE
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE BAR THE FIRST GUY
HE APPROACHES THE FIRST WOMAN THAT HE SEES
OFFERS HER A DRINK
SHE TURNS HIM DOWN
HE THEN DECIDES TO WORK HIS WAY DOWN THE BAR
AND OF COURSE ALL THE WOMEN WATCHING THIS THEY SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO
AND THEY ALL TURN HIM DOWN
NOW OUR GUY I'M GOING TO CALL HIM THE ANTI HERO
HE HASN'T LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE
IN THE REAL WORLD SO HE DECIDES TO GO TO THE VIRTUAL WORLD HE
GOES TO THE INTERNET AND JOINS CUPID COM
AND HE TRIES THE SAME TECHNIQUE
AND SURE ENOUGH WITH THE SAME RESULT THEY ALL TURN HIM
AND PERSUADED CONGRESS IN 1978 AND 1980 RESPECTIVELY TO DISMANTLE THE SYSTEM OF AIRLINE AND TRUCKING REGULATION AGAINST THE STIFF OPPOSITION OF COURSE OF THOSE INDUSTRIES
AND YOU MAY NOT RECALL BUT PRICES FELL AFTER DEREGULATION
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR MY STORY IS THAT DEREGULATION UNLEASHED VIGOROUS COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO GIANTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY UPS AND FEDEX
THEY WENT ON TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
THAT WAS IDEAL FOR THE INTERNET ECONOMY
WELL NAME YOUR PRICE TRAVEL WAS REALLY NOT THE KEY TO THEIR SUCCESS BECAUSE IF YOU COULD NAME YOUR PRICE WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU BID ZERO
WELL ECONOMISTS HELPED BUILD THE INTERNET ECONOMY
ECONOMISTS HELP MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR AMAZON AND OTHER WEB RETAILERS TO DELIVER ALL THAT STUFF THAT YOU ORDER TO YOUR DOORSTEP EFFICIENTLY AND PROMPTLY 24 7
ECONOMISTS
SHAPE THE SYSTEM OF ONLINE ADVERTISING ESPECIALLY ONLINE AUCTIONS
ECONOMISTS MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GET FIVE
BUT THE CEO OF GOOGLE AT THE TIME ERIC SCHMIDT STILL WASN'T SOLD ON THE SECOND PRICE AUCTION AS THE WAY TO GO UNTIL HE
THIS IS THE NOTION OF ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY
TAKING WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN ABUNDANT RESOURCE WHICH IS DATE OFFERS
AND ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRAINING THEM
AND THE ECONOMIST SAID TO CUPID THAT IF YOU DO THIS
THE MEN WILL TAKE THEIR OFFER SERIOUSLY
THEY'LL LOOK AT MORE THAN JUST THE WOMEN'S PICTURES AND THEY ACTUALLY LOOK AT THEIR PROFILES
AND THE WOMEN WILL KNOW THIS
AND THEY'LL BE MORE LIKELY
TO ACCEPT DATE PROPOSALS
ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY HELP SAVE CUPID COM AND OTHER DATING SITES THAT COPIED THE TECHNIQUE
TODAY
ONLINE DATING IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN NORTH AMERICA ALONE
NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A LOT MORE
THAN ONLINE DATING AND ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY
MUCH BIGGER TOPIC
I WANT TO TRY TO SHOW TO YOU HOW ECONOMISTS AND THEIR IDEAS
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE OF THE ENTIRE INTERNET ECONOMY
AND TO SOME OF THE ICONIC COMPANIES WITHIN IT
1989 THE COMMUNIST REGIME WAS MOVED AWAY THE BERLIN WALL CAME DOWN AND ONE YEAR LATER
MORE ABOUT HOW THE GDR SURVEILLANCE STATE FUNCTIONED PERHAPS YOU HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE THE LIVES OF OTHERS THIS MOVIE MADE THE
IMPORTANT STEP TOOK PLACE UNDER THE ATTENDANCE OF THE RUSSIANS BUT THE GERMANS ARE KNOWN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE SO THE STASI GREW VERY QUICKLY
JULY LAST YEAR YOU FILED A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT WITH A GERMAN
LEAVE THIS HALL AFTER THE CONFERENCE NOBODY HAS TO BE AFRAID THAT THE SECRET POLICE IS STANDING OUT AND IS ARRESTING YOU SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN I THINK PEOPLE ARE NOT REALLY SCARED AS THEY COULD BE
BUT OF COURSE I THINK THE INSTITUTIONS ARE
THE STASI RECRUITED SO MANY INFORMANTS THE SYSTEM OF HOW TO GET THEM AND HOW TO EDUCATE THEM AS IT WAS CALLED WAS VERY SOPHISTICATED
TO STOP ILLEGAL ACTIONS IN GERMANY OR WHEREVER THEY HAPPEN BG A
THEREFORE NO ORDER TO CRASH DOWN THE UPRISING WAS GIVEN TO THE STASI SECONDLY IN THE COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY THERE'S NO PLACE FOR CRITICISM
AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU SEE THE GERMAN HISTORY WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD TO ESCAPE AND THEY ASKED FOR ASYLUM IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEY DIDN'T GET IT SO IT WOULD BE GOOD SIGN TO GIVE HIM ASYLUM
GIVE HIM THE ASYLUM BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS REALLY BRAVE WHAT HE DID AND HE DESTROYED HIS WHOLE LIFE AND HIS FAMILY AND EVERYTHING SO I THINK FOR THESE PEOPLE WE SHOULD DO
WHY HK YEAH I DID SO BECAUSE OF THE SECOND POINT I MENTIONED THAT I THINK ESPECIALLY IN A DEMOCRACY
AND CHINA ARE DOING THE SAME BUT NOBODY SPEAKS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE NOBODY COULD DO THAT
WERE WIRETAPPED INCLUDING THE PHONE OF THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR IN THE WEST AND OFTEN ALSO THE APARTMENTS EVERY DAY 90000 LETTERS WERE BEING OPENED
PEOPLE OFFICIALLY LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE STASI HAD ITS OWN ARMED
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN ONE ORGANIZATION
FIRST OF ALL THE STASI WAS AN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
IT USED ALL THE IMAGINABLE INSTRUMENTS FOR GETTING INFORMATION SECRETLY
SUCH AS INFORMERS
OR TAPPING
THE RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS FOUNDED THE EMERGENCY COMMISSION FOR COMBATING COUNTER REVOLUTION AND SABOTAGE SHORTLY CHEKA IT WAS LED BY FELIX
APPARENTLY TRUSTABLE PERSON WAS AN INFORMER
OF SOCIALISM THE SOVIET UNION A MORE LIBERAL POLICY TOOK PLACE IN ADDITION THE REGIME WAS DEPENDENT ON THE LOANS FROM THE WEST
WORLDWIDE AND AS WE LIVE IN AN AGE WHERE WORDS SUCH AS SURVEILLANCE OR WIRETAPPING ARE ON THE FRONT PAGES OF NEWSPAPERS I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THE STASI REALLY WORKED
IT'S WRITTEN IN THE CRIMINAL CODE OF GERMANY SO IF IT'S NOT RESPECTED THEN
I THINK AN INVESTIGATION IS NECESSARY AND IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME THAT THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR OF GERMANY STARTED THIS AND HE STARTED IT ONLY IN THE CASE OF ANGELA MERKEL AND NOT IN THE CASE OF
STOPPED BY HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS THAT'S WHY TODAY WE CAN USE THE FILES TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW A SURVEILLANCE STATE FUNCTIONS THANK YOU
THE LEADERSHIP STUCK TO THE BELIEF THAT SOCIALISM IS A PERFECT SYSTEM AND THE STASI HAD TO CONFIRM THAT OF COURSE
PEOPLE FEEL SECURE IN THIS DEMOCRACY THEY AREN'T AFRAID THAT THEY WILL BE ARRESTED
WHO WANTS TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED IS AN EFFECTIVE WHISTLEBLOWER THE MAIN REASONS WHY PEOPLE COOPERATED WITH THE STASI WERE POLITICAL CONVICTION AND MATERIAL BENEFITS
HE USED A SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE IN WHICH STRICT ISOLATION WAS CENTRAL NEARLY NO PRISONER RESISTED WITHOUT GIVING A TESTIMONY
GERMANY IS CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACEFUL REVOLUTION IN EAST GERMANY
THE RULES WE HAVE THE THIRD POINT PROBABLY WE REALLY CAN BE HAPPY THAT WE LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY BECAUSE YOU CAN BE SURE
WRITER WAS BETRAYED BY HIS BROTHER THIS REMINDS ME OF THE NOVEL 1984 BY GEORGE ORWELL WHERE
FAILURES IN THEIR WORK
AND BY DESTROYING THEIR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
CONSIDERING THIS EAST GERMANY WAS VERY MODERN DICTATORSHIP
THE STASI DIDN'T TRY TO ARREST EVERY DISSIDENT
IT PREFERRED TO PARALYZE THEM
AND IT COULD DO SO
BECAUSE IT HAD ACCESS TO SO MUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION
AND TO SO MANY INSTITUTIONS
THIRDLY THE STASI WORKED AS A KIND OF PUBLIC PROSECUTOR
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION AS A HISTORIAN WHEN YOU SEE THIS HUBERTUS KNABE THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL ASPECTS TO MENTION AT FIRST I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF
ARE COLLECTING THIS DATA ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR PROTECTING YOUR PEOPLE AGAINST TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR OPPRESSING YOUR PEOPLE SO THAT MAKES A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BUT ON THE OTHER
HE DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEBODY TRIED TO ACT AGAINST THE REGIME HE WANTED TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT PEOPLE WERE THINKING AND PLANNING
AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS GERMANY INHERITED THE ARCHIVES OF THE EAST GERMAN SECRET POLICE KNOWN AS THE STASI
INSTRUMENTS CAN ONLY REGISTER WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING BUT AGENTS AND SPIES CAN ALSO REPORT WHAT PEOPLE ARE PLANNING TO DO AND WHAT THEY ARE THINKING
COLLECTED THE SMELL OF PEOPLE IT STORED SAMPLES OF IT IN CLOSED
THE LEADERSHIP IN EAST GERMANY WAS UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AGAINST THE GROWING PROTEST OF PEOPLE IT WAS ESPECIALLY CONFUSED BECAUSE IN THE
ARE FOR EVERYBODY THEY ARE MADE FOR EVERYBODY SO IT'S NOT ALLOWED THAT ANY INSTITUTION DOESN'T RESPECT THE RULES IN THE CRIMINAL CODE OF GERMANY IT'S WRITTEN THAT IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO TAP SOMEBODY WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THE JUDGE
SPEECH THE STASI MINISTER GAVE THE ORDER TO FIND OUT WHO IS WHO WHICH MEANT WHO THINKS WHAT
ALSO IN A DEMOCRACY THESE INSTRUMENTS CAN BE ABUSED AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHERE WE REALLY HAVE TO BE AWARE TO STOP THAT AND THAT ALSO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ARE
BROAD
IN NEARLY EVERY INSTITUTION EVEN IN THE CHURCHES OR IN WEST GERMANY
THERE WERE MANY OF THEM
I REMEMBER TELLING A LEADING STASI OFFICER
IF YOU HAD SENT AN INFORMANT TO ME
I WOULD SURELY HAVE RECOGNIZED HIM
WITH THE OBJECT OF OBSERVATION THE AGENT WHO SHADOWED ME DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS OR WHY I WAS SURVEYED IN FACT I SMUGGLED FORBIDDEN BOOKS FROM WEST TO EAST
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC THE GDR IN THE EAST WAS UNIFIED WITH THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IN THE WEST TO FOUND TODAY'S
IT'S A QUITE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION THE GOAL WAS TO DESTROY SECRETLY THE SELF CONFIDENCE OF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE BY DAMAGING THEIR REPUTATION
ELVIS IS FOLLOWING ARISTOTLE'S CLASSIC DEFINITION OF METAPHOR AS THE PROCESS OF GIVING THE THING A NAME THAT BELONGS TO SOMETHING ELSE
OF THE METAPHORS WE USE EVERYDAY ARE SYNESTHETIC SILENCE IS SWEET NECKTIES ARE LOUD
MATTERS BECAUSE IT OPENS THE DOOR TO DISCOVERY WHENEVER WE SOLVE A PROBLEM OR MAKE A DISCOVERY WE COMPARE WHAT WE KNOW WITH WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE LATTER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE WAYS IT MIGHT BE LIKE THE
THEN GIVEN ONE OF THREE DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS HYPOTHETICAL CRISIS EACH OF WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO TRIGGER A DIFFERENT HISTORICAL ANALOGY
WORLD WAR II VIETNAM AND THE THIRD WAS HISTORICALLY NEUTRAL
THOSE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD WAR II SCENARIO MADE MORE INTERVENTIONIST RECOMMENDATIONS THAN THE OTHERS
DO WE DO THAT BECAUSE WE INSTINCTIVELY FIND OR CREATE A
YET IT'S HIDDEN BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WORDS AROUND YOU AND YOU'LL FIND
IT WAS FOSSIL POETRY LANGUAGE WAS FOSSIL METAPHOR AND THESE
ATTENTION THE NEXT TIME YOU READ THE FINANCIAL NEWS AGENT METAPHORS DESCRIBE PRICE MOVEMENTS AS THE DELIBERATE ACTION OF A LIVING THING AS IN THE NASDAQ
SHOWS THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE THE LITERAL MEANING OF WORDS EVEN WHEN THE LITERAL MEANING GIVES THE WRONG ANSWER
STROOP TESTS HAVE BEEN DONE WITH METAPHOR AS WELL
THE PARTICIPANTS HAD TO IDENTIFY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE LITERALLY FALSE SENTENCES
THEY TOOK LONGER TO REJECT METAPHORS AS FALSE THAN THEY DID TO REJECT LITERALLY FALSE SENTENCES
METAPHOR
LIVES A SECRET LIFE ALL AROUND US WE UTTER ABOUT SIX METAPHORS A MINUTE
METAPHORICAL THINKING IS ESSENTIAL TO HOW WE UNDERSTAND OURSELVES
AND OTHERS
HOW WE COMMUNICATE
LEARN DISCOVER
AND INVENT
A BETTER TRANSLATION
THE LATIN WORD COGITO IS DERIVED FROM THE PREFIX CO MEANING TOGETHER
AND THE VERB AGITARE MEANING TO SHAKE
SO THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF COGITO
IS TO SHAKE TOGETHER
AND THE PROPER TRANSLATION OF COGITO ERGO SUM IS
I SHAKE THINGS UP
THEREFORE I
WITH COLORED HEARING ACTUALLY SEE COLORS WHEN THEY HEAR THE SOUNDS OF WORDS OR LETTERS WE ALL HAVE SYNESTHETIC ABILITIES
EXAMPLE HOUSE PRICES ARE ROUTINELY DESCRIBED AS CLIMBING AND CLIMBING HIGHER AND HIGHER PEOPLE MIGHT NATURALLY ASSUME THAT THAT RISE IS UNSTOPPABLE THEY MAY FEEL CONFIDENT SAY IN TAKING OUT MORTGAGES THEY REALLY CAN'T AFFORD
THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF COURSE
BUT THIS IS HOW METAPHOR
WE GIVE A THING A NAME THAT BELONGS TO SOMETHING ELSE WE GIVE IT A WHOLE NETWORK OF ANALOGIES TOO
WE MIX AND MATCH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE METAPHOR'S SOURCE IN THIS CASE THE SUN WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ITS TARGET JULIET
AND METAPHOR GIVES US MUCH MORE VIVID UNDERSTANDING OF JULIET THAN IF SHAKESPEARE HAD LITERALLY DESCRIBED WHAT SHE LOOKS
TREES WELL WE CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY IN NORTHERN THAILAND TRAVELING AROUND AND I SAW THESE KIND OF BARE
YOU NEED THE FOREST BECAUSE THE FOREST
THAILAND AND OUR COMMON FUTURE
AND I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO USE THEIR CREATIVITY
TO CREATE A BUSINESS
IN SUCH A WAY
THAT WE CAN
GET THE VALUE TO THE FOREST THAT IT'S WORTH
IF WE CAN START TO MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS
FROM THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THE FOREST STILL
GROWS WE CAN HELP THE FARMERS TO GET AN INCOME TO KEEP
THE FOREST
BEFORE THE CHINESE INVENTED THE TEA FOR DRINKING PEOPLE IN
ONE AREA IN THE WORLD IN THE MOUNTAIN
TO KEEP A VERY GOOD TASTE AND A VERY HIGH QUALITY OF TEA SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
UP HERE IN NORTHERN THAILAND
BUT IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE MAYBE THIS IS HOW THEY WILL LOOK IN THE FUTURE
AND THIS IS NOT THE FUTURE WE WANT IS IT
WE ALL HAVE SEEN THIS IN OUR SCHOOL BOOKS
I THINK EVERYBODY SAW IT IN THEIR SCHOOL BOOKS WE LEARNED THIS
BUT DID WE
FOR PRODUCING TEA FERMENTING THE TEA FOR EATING AND THIS IN THAILAND IS CALLED MIANG
THIS IS STILL ALSO POPULAR IN BURMA AND IS CALLED LAHPET THOKE
AND PROBABLY THIS WAS USED IN ALL THIS REGION WHERE TEA WAS GROWING WILD BEFORE BUT TODAY
FORGOTTEN IN MOST OF THE PLACES
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THAILAND
FOR THE TEA THEY FOUND IN THE FOREST THEY CUT DOWN THE FOREST ALL AROUND THE TEA
THIS WAY THEY DON'T WANT TO CUT DOWN THE TREES BECAUSE IF THEY CUT DOWN THE TREES AROUND IT
WE DON'T BUY IT ANYMORE
SO TO ACHIEVE THIS WE AND THE FARMERS AND A LOCAL TEA PROFESSIONAL
WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER
SO THIS IS A MIANG PLANTATION
AND THIS GROWS LIKE AS YOU CAN SEE TOGETHER WITH OTHER TREES AND OTHER THINGS
BUT
THE
MIANG CONSUMPTION HAD DROPPED
DRAMATICALLY
TODAY I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE
UNDER 60 YEARS OLD EATS MIANG ANYMORE
SO
THE MIANG BUSINESS IS NOT VERY GOOD THEY DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY AND THIS PUT THIS MIANG PLANTATION IN DANGER TO BE CUT DOWN AND REPLACED WITH HIGHER VALUE CROPS
BUT WHAT IF
WE TAKE THIS LEAF
AND WE START TO PRODUCE
THE
HERE SO IN THE FUTURE WE WILL ONCE AGAIN
GET FOREST IN ITS NATURAL HABITAT
AND THIS IS A WAY THAT WE ALSO CAN USE THE TEA
OR THE INCOME FROM FOREST FRIENDLY TEA
TO NOT ONLY PROTECT FOREST BUT ALSO ACTUALLY REFOREST AND REFOREST DAMAGED AREA LIKE THIS
SO TO CONCLUDE THIS
THIS PRESENTATION HAVING INTRODUCED A WAY OF TURNING A LOCAL
PRODUCT THAT NOT SO MANY PEOPLE USE ANYMORE
INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT THE WORLD DEMANDS
TEA IS THE SECOND MOST DRINK IN THE WORLD
FOR CROPS SUCH AS RUBBER CORN AND FRUIT PRODUCTION
ALL THIS HAS PUT THE FOREST IN NORTHERN THAILAND
IN A LITTLE BIT OF DANGER
SO NOW I COME TO WHAT TEA CAN DO
TO SAVE THIS FOREST
BUT FIRST TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I HAVE TO FIRST SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE TEA PLANT
TODAY AS I'VE SAID
ALL THE POLLUTION THAT WE ARE THROWING OUT
IT GIVES US BIODIVERSITY
AND IT GIVES US THE RAIN AND KEEPS THE WATER THAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE
SO WHAT CAN TEA
DO TO SAVE FORESTS OR TO HELP THE FOREST
NO I'M NOT COMING TO THAT YET
FIRST HAVE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE
SINCE 1994
WHEN A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND MY TEA MENTOR
CONVINCED ME TO OPEN UP A TEA SHOP IN MADRID IN SPAIN
AND ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO
I CAME TO THAILAND TO SOURCE CERAMIC TEAPOTS
AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE THAT THAILAND WAS GROWING TEA
NOT UNTIL
A FRIEND OF MINE
WHO TODAY IS ALSO MY BUSINESS PARTNER MR VORAKAN WONGFU
HE TOLD ME SO
BUT I WAS NOT SURE BECAUSE I'D NEVER HEARD ABOUT TEA FROM THAILAND I'D HEARD ABOUT TEA FROM INDIA FROM SRI LANKA FROM CHINA
EVEN FROM RUSSIA BUT NEVER ABOUT TEA FROM THAILAND
SO
HE WANTED TO SHOW ME SO HE TOOK ME
NOW I'M GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS HOW CAN
WE SAVE THE FOREST WITH THIS TEA
WE TURNED THIS MIANG FOREST INTO HIGH QUALITY
ECOLOGICAL FRIENDLY TEA
IN THIS WAY
YEARS AGO
I MET
A VERY IMPORTANT TEA PROFESSIONAL HERE IN CHIANG MAI
AND SHE INTRODUCED ME TO OTHER TEA PROFESSIONALS AND TEA FARMERS AND THEY SAID YEAH IT'S OKAY YOU CAN DO THAT WE DO IT ALREADY
SO THEN I GOT THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE
TEA ONLY FROM THAILAND
IS NOT PERFECT YET
BUT WE WORK WITH BIOLOGISTS FOREST
SPECIALISTS TEA PROFESSIONALS TO
INCREASE QUALITY
AND ALSO
WAWEE
BUT WE HAVE CONVINCED THIS TEA PRODUCER IN THIS MOUNTAIN HERE
TO REPLANT THIS FOREST TO REFOREST THIS MOUNTAIN
SO FAR THEY HAVE PLANTED
1000 TREES OF 50 DIFFERENT VARIETIES
IN THIS
THAT CAN PROVIDE INCOME TO THE FARMERS BY KEEPING
AND BEFORE THE CHINESE WHO HAD THIS BRILLIANT IDEA TO INVENT
THINKING ABOUT THIS DEFORESTATION AND ALSO ABOUT THIS TEA THAT MY FRIEND JUST HAD SHOWN ME INSIDE THE FOREST SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS MY PROFESSION SO I THOUGHT WOW IT'D BE COOL TO MAKE TEA FOR
IS THE ABILITY TO PROGRAM PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS TO CHANGE SHAPE CHANGE PROPERTIES AND EVEN COMPUTE OUTSIDE OF SILICON BASED
SHAKING PNEUMATICS GRAVITY MAGNETICS
OFF THE BED THE PARTS CAN TRANSFORM FROM ONE SHAPE TO ANOTHER SHAPE DIRECTLY ON THEIR OWN
SO REMEMBER I SAID 4D SO TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE UNVEILING NEW
TO START FROM SCRATCH AND TAKE THEM OUT AND REPLACE THEM SO I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT WE CAN COMBINE THOSE TWO
COMPLETELY PRINT THIS PART AND IT CAN TRANSFORM INTO SOMETHING ELSE
ISN'T EXPENSIVE PUMPS OR VALVES THIS IS COMPLETELY PROGRAMMABLE AND ADAPTIVE PIPE ON ITS
ASSEMBLY STRUCTURES THAT CAN GO FROM HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS FROM ONE TO
STARTED A LAB AT MIT AND IT'S CALLED THE SELF ASSEMBLY LAB AND WE'RE DEDICATED TO TRYING TO DEVELOP PROGRAMMABLE MATERIALS FOR THE BUILT
OF THE THREE DIMENSIONAL PROTEIN AND HOW IT FOLDS AND ALL OF THE INTRICACIES OF THE
SO IN ONE DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS THIS IS A PROJECT CALLED THE SELF FOLDING
AT THE MICRO AND NANOSCALES THERE'S AN UNPRECEDENTED REVOLUTION HAPPENING
THINK THERE'S A FEW KEY SECTORS THAT HAVE FAIRLY NEAR TERM
BURY THEM IN THE GROUND IF ANYTHING CHANGES IF THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGES THE GROUND MOVES OR DEMAND
HOW WE COULD USE THIS AS A MACROSCALE CONSTRUCTION OR MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUE FOR PRODUCTS
WE LOOK AT THE HUMAN SCALE THERE'S MASSIVE PROBLEMS THAT AREN'T BEING ADDRESSED BY THOSE NANOSCALE
MAYBE THERE'S EVEN A SOUND TECHNICIAN
AND WHILE I'VE BEEN IMPROVISING AND PLAYING I THINK TO MYSELF IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD ADD THE SOUND OF SOME WATER BEHIND THIS SOLO OR MAYBE IF I COULD ADD SOME EXTRA ECHOE IN THIS SECTION BUT THERE'D BE NO WAY TO ACTUALLY ADD THOSE SOUNDS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PERFORMANCE TV
WE'VE ORGANISED AND DEPENDING ON WHERE I AM IN THE SPACE I'LL BE PLAYING MUSIC WITHIN A DIFFERENT SONIC ATMOSPHERE TV AND AS
COMBINE THOSE ELEMENTS GIVING A PERFORMER FULL CONTROL OVER THE OUTPUT OF THEIR SOUND AS IT'S BEING MODIFIED ELECTRONICALLY USING JUST THE MOVEMENTS OF THEIR BODY JAY L SO
COME TRUE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I CAN MOVE AROUND THE SPACE IT'S A GRID WE HAVE HERE ON THE
SO THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS IS THE KINNECT IS USING INFRA RED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING IN FRONT OF IT AND WHEN
TELL STORIES THEY TELL STORIES THE WAY OLD PEOPLE TELL STORIES
THAT REALLY GET IN TROUBLE FOR OUR STORIES EVERY FEW WEEKS THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT THIS COMEDIAN THAT SAID SOMETHING AWFUL OR OFFENSIVE
YOU KNEW THE STORIES THAT YOU HEARD AS A KID WEREN'T TRUE RIGHT THERE WAS NO MONSTER UNDER THE BED NO BOOGIE MAN IN THE CORNER YOUR GRANDDAD WASN'T REALLY RIPPING OFF HIS THUMB AND TAKING THE PAIN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL HE WAS JUST
BASICALLY I DON'T REALLY GET THE TERM OFFENSIVE COMEDY NO COMEDIAN WANTS TO OFFEND YOU THAT'S NOT OUR JOB OUR JOB IS TO MAKE YOU LAUGH MAKE YOU THINK MAKE YOU
AND BLATANTLY WRONG AND FIND A WAY TO
TWIST IT ROUND AND MAKE IT SEEM VALID JUST FOR A SECOND FOR EXAMPLE IF I WERE TO MAKE THE STATEMENT I DON'T THINK CHILDREN SHOULD SMOKE
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WOULD AGREE WITH IT YEAH BUT
IF I WERE TO COME OUT ON STAGE AND SAY I THINK EVERY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 SHOULD BE FORCED TO SMOKE FOUR PACKS OF CIGARETTES A DAY BECAUSE AS MY BROTHERS ARE GETTING OLDER IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO BEING ABLE TO BEAT ME IN FOOT RACE
THAT'S A WAY OF TURNING IT AROUND YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING AT THE FACT THAT I'M TRYING TO KILL MY BROTHERS YOU'RE LAUGHING AT ME FOR BEING AN IDIOT FOR THINKING THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
OK
AND THAT'S
MURDERER WHO WOULD DISGUISE HIMSELF AS A CLOSE RELATIVE IN ORDER TO GET CLOSE TO YOUNG GIRL SO THAT HE COULD HAVE HIS WAY WITH HER
AND JUST BEFORE HE MANAGED TO DO THAT HE WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED
EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT MY DAD'S A DREADFUL MAN
BUT IF POINT OUT THAT THAT'S THE BASIC STORY LINE FOR LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD'
A LOT LESS PEOPLE ARE PHONING CHILD SERVICES
I WAS WILLING TO FABRICATE A STORY ABOUT MY MOTHER BEING AN ALCOHOLIC WITH AN EMOTIONAL PROBLEM WHO WAS WILLING TO DISOWN ME AS A HUMAN BEING JUST SO 50 OF YOU WENT VERY GOOD
TO SLEEP WITH US SO THAT OUR NIGHT IN THAT HOTEL ROOM IS SLIGHTLY LESS DEPRESSING
NOT TO UPSET YOU IN ANY WAY SHAPE FORM BECAUSE
THE THING ABOUT IT IS WHEN COMEDIANS ARE TELLING THESE STORIES IT'S TO GET ANY FORM OF A REACTION
OUT OF YOU AND JIMMY CARR FAMOUSLY WAS IN TROUBLE RECENTLY HE MADE A JOKE ABOUT THE PARALYMPICS HE MADE A JOKE THAT OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ WERE GETTING INJURED BUT AT LEAST
AND PEOPLE WENT MENTAL
THAT JOKE TO HER SEVERAL TIMES
IN ORDER TO GET REACTION
THAT'S WHEN SHE KNEW ABOUT IT I AM FULLY AWARE THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WHO DON'T LIKE ME
WHO SAY MEAN THINGS ABOUT ME EVERYDAY BUT I'D RATHER NOT KNOW
OK IF YOU CAME UP TO ME AND YOU
JOKES THERE'S VERY RARELY MALICIOUS INTENT BEHIND IT
THERE MAY NOT BE JOKES THAT YOU LIKE BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TAKING A CONCEPT AND WE'RE EXAGGERATING IT LYING ABOUT IT TURNING IT IN SUCH A WAY YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING IT AND SOMETIMES WE TURN IT IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
BUT THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
THE WORLD DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND YOU IGNORE IT MOVE ON FORGET ABOUT IT
ALRIGHT
BLATANTLY STUPID SACRIFICE THEY NEVER NEEDED TO MAKE
IT'S AMAZING ONE OF THE OTHER TOPICS ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ONES LAST YEAR WAS THAT FRANKIE BOYLE
MADE HIS COMMENT ABOUT KATIE PRICE AND HER FAMILY REGARDLESS OF YOUR OPINIONS ON THE JOKE WHICH EVERYONE WILL BE DIVIDED ON
DON'T PAY THAT IN CONTEXT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT FRANKIE BOYLE MADE THOSE JOKES ABOUT
KATIE PRICE NOT TO HER
ABOUT HER
HE MADE THAT JOKE ONSTAGE IN FRONT OF A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE WHO WERE FULLY EXPECTING HIM TO MAKE THAT SORT OF COMMENT
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE NEWSPAPERS PHONED
PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT OFFENDED BY THAT JOKE THE WAR VETERANS WHO FOUND IT HYSTERICAL THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT THEY
BOYLE IS THE ONLY COMEDIAN THAT DOESN'T RESPECT HER LIFE CHOICES NO OF COURSE WE'RE JUST INDIVIDUALS
CAME OUT OF INGLORIOUS BASTARDS GOING OH I CAN'T BELIEVE CHRISTOPHER WALTZ KILLED ALL THOSE JEWISH PEOPLE WHAT AN AWFUL MAN NOBODY
SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT RAPE OR MURDER THOSE SORT OF THINGS ON STAGE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE BROADCAST IN A HOUSEHOLD AND WE ALL FEEL QUITE GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES THEN SWITCH OVER TO EASTENDERS OR TRUE BLOOD WHERE THERE ARE SCENES OF MURDER SEXUAL AUDACITY DRUG ABUSE RACIALLY INVOKED CRIMES AND WE ALL GO THIS IS AMAZING
WHY IS IT DIFFERENT
HOW COME WHEN A COMEDIAN SAYS SOMETHING AS A JOKE IT'S OFFENSIVE
BUT WHEN IT'S ACTED OUT IN FRONT OF YOU IT'S INTRIGUING IT'S A TWIST
ACTORS ARE NEVER CRITICIZED OR ABUSED FOR THEIR ROLES IN FILMS
APPLY THE SAME LOGIC TO OUR STORIES WE'RE SAYING THESE
REALITY YOU ONLY THOUGHT OF COMEBACKS ON THE WAY HOME BUT SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT SHE'S ON HER THIRD MARTINI SHE'S READY TO GO
WE ALL TELL STORIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS AS WELL WHEN MY DAD TELLS STORIES HE'S STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
IT'S ALL THE FACTS NO FRILLS THIS HAPPENED THIS HAPPENED THEN THIS HAPPENED THEREFORE THIS HAPPENED MORAL OF THIS STORY IS DON'T DRINK TEQUILA WITH YOUR MOTHER OTHERWISE YOU HAPPEN
WHEN MY MUM TELLS A STORY SHE LIKES TO HAVE ALL THE EXTRA DETAILS ALL THE BACK STORIES ALL THE CHARACTER BIOGRAPHIES AND BY THE END IT'S BEEN LIKE A NINE HOUR VERSION OF INCEPTION YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENED YOU JUST KNOW APPARENTLY SOMEONE YOUR MUM WORKS WITH IS BIT OF A COW
WHEN MY
SO IF THEY WEREN'T OFFENDED BY THAT JOKE WHO'S GOT THE RIGHT TO BE OFFENDED
ARTISTS EVERYTHING'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF TELLING STORY I TELL STORIES DIFFERENTLY AS WELL I'M COMEDIAN
I TELL STORIES THAT ARE PUNCHY JOKEY ALL THE WAY THROUGH IN ORDER TO KEEP AN AUDIENCES EVER SHORTENING ATTENTION SPAN SOLELY FOCUS ON ME I TELL TRUE STORIES I TELL EXAGGERATED STORIES I TELL STORIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY MADE UP TOTAL LIES LIKE I'LL HAVE BEEN SITTING WITH MY FRIENDS HAVING A DRINK AND ONE OF THEM'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE AH WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF THIS HAPPENED AND I'LL THINK TO MYSELF
YEAH THAT WOULD BE FUNNY
AND THEN I SHAMELESSLY TAKE IT DOWN IN MY
IPHONE TAKE IT HOME WRITE OUT AND SOMEHOW INTEGRATE MYSELF INTO THIS STORY SO I'D BECOME A HERO SO I CAN THEN GO OUT ON STAGE IN FRONT OF A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS IN A DESPERATE BID TO GET THEM TO LIKE ME
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL A COMEDIAN IS WE'RE DESPERATE STORYTELLERS
YOU'RE NOT GIVEN THE SETUP YOU'RE NOT GIVEN THE ATMOSPHERE YOU'RE NOT EVEN GIVEN THE AUDIENCE REACTION AND THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU DON'T TAKE OTHER STORYTELLER'S STORIES OUT OF CONTEXT IF I WERE TO TELL YOU WHEN WAS FIVE YEARS OLD MY DAD WOULD TELL MY A STORY
THERE WAS A MAN I'D NEVER MET BEFORE WHO WAS SAYING HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ME AND YOU
THAT COMEDIANS HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH ANY HARDSHIPS WHEREAS MOST OF THE TIME IT'S HARDSHIP THAT'S CAUSED US TO GET INTO COMEDY
OUR REACTION TO OUR HARDSHIPS WAS TO MAKE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION AND GET OVER IT AS OPPOSED TO GOING ROUND THE COUNTRY MAKING SURE THAT NOBODY EVER MENTIONS IT EVER AGAIN TO HURT MY DELICATE SOUL
SO THAT'S MY POINT THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IF AT ANY POINT YOU'VE DIS AGREED WITH ANYTHING I'VE SAID DON'T WORRY IT WAS JUST A STORY I MADE IT ALL UP
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
GOING ONSTAGE SAYING WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DOWN THE PUB IS SAYING ON A FRIDAY NIGHT IT SEEMS THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT ABOUT CELEBRITIES BUT COMEDIANS CAN'T AND THAT'S HYPOCRISY THAT'S NOT FAIR
THERE IS A MARKET FOR SHOCK COMEDY A HUGE MARKET OK BUT THERE'S ALSO MARKET FOR LEGGING SADOMASOCHISM AND JUSTIN BIEBER
ALL ARGUABLY MORE OFFENSIVE THAN ANYTHING ANYONE'S EVER SAID
ONSTAGE WE MIGHT PLAY A VERSION OF OURSELVES BUT WE CAN'T BE OUR TRUE SELVES IF WE WERE TO COME ON STAGE AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR REAL OPINIONS WITH BALANCED THOUGHT THROUGH POINTS WE WOULDN'T BE COMEDIANS WE WOULD BE POLITICIANS AND YOU'D HATE US EVEN MORE
RIGHT WHEN WE COME ON STAGE WE HAVE
DON'T LIKE TO BRAG IT'S ALWAYS STUFF LIKE OH AND THEN I GOT MY MEDAL FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL FOR SAVING ALL THOSE ORPHANS BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME HOW'S SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE THE OPPOSITE WHEN MY
BIGGEST SURPRISE OF THAT DAY WAS THAT THERE WAS NO BIG SURPRISE IN THE EYE OF THEORETICAL
IS NOT A CHANGE IN THE WAY THE MOLECULES ARE ARRANGED INSIDE THE MATERIAL BUT IS ABOUT A CHANGE OF THE VERY FABRIC OF SPACE TIME
YOU CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING A CERTAIN VALUE OF THE HIGGS MASS
THEN THE KEY TO THE MYSTERY COULD LIE IN THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE MULTIVERSE
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WITH SAND DUNES ON A
ME QUANTUM TUNNELING IS A REAL PHENOMENON AND IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY SYSTEMS
PENETRATING THE WALL BUT DON'T EXPECT ME TO ACTUALLY PERFORM THE TRICK IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES BECAUSE THE PROBABILITY FOR ME TO PENETRATE THE WALL IS
IN WHY A PHENOMENON WORKS IN THE WAY IT WORKS
WE THINK THAT THIS THESE WHY QUESTIONS
CAN GIVE US CLUES ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURE
AND INDEED
A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO MY
TIME UNDERWENT A PHASE TRANSITION IT WAS SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THE PHASE TRANSITION THAT OCCURS
OF THIS STATE COULD SUDDENLY APPEAR IN A CERTAIN PLACE OF THE UNIVERSE AT A CERTAIN TIME AND IT IS ANALOGOUS TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BOIL WATER BUBBLES OF VAPOR FORM INSIDE THE WATER THEN THEY EXPAND TURNING
VALUE OF THE HIGGS BOSON MASS IS VERY SPECIAL
IT HAS JUST THE RIGHT VALUE TO KEEP THE UNIVERSE HANGING IN AN UNSTABLE SITUATION
THE HIGGS FIELD IS IN WOBBLY CONFIGURATION THAT HAS LASTED SO FAR
BUT THAT WILL EVENTUALLY
COLLAPSE
SO
ACCORDING TO THESE
OF THIS NUMBER WE LEARN SO MUCH I STARTED FROM A HYPOTHESIS THAT THE KNOWN PARTICLES
COLLEAGUES HERE AT CERN WE COMPUTED THE PROBABILITY THAT OUR UNIVERSE COULD QUANTUM TUNNEL INTO THE ULTRA DENSE HIGGS STATE
IT'S A BIG A PROBLEM WE MAY NOT REALIZE IT IN ORDINARY LIFE BUT THE INTENSITY OF THE HIGGS FIELD IS CRITICAL FOR THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER IF THE
SHOWS THAT QUANTUM TUNNELING OF THE HIGGS FIELD IS NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR
IN THE NEXT 10 TO THE 100 YEARS
AND THIS IS A VERY LONG TIME
IT'S EVEN LONGER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES FOR ITALY TO FORM A STABLE GOVERNMENT
OR SOLID SO THE HIGGS FIELD THE SUBSTANCE THAT FILLS ALL SPACE TIME COULD EXIST IN TWO
OF A PARTICLE
AND BY DISCOVERING THE HIGGS BOSON THE LHC HAS CONCLUSIVELY PROVED THAT THIS SUBSTANCE IS REAL
BECAUSE IT IS THE STUFF THE HIGGS BOSONS ARE MADE OF
AND THIS IN A NUTSHELL IS THE ESSENCE OF THE HIGGS STORY
BUT THIS STORY IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT
COLLAPSE OF THE HIGGS FIELD BECAUSE OF TWO COMPETING EFFECTS JUST AS IN THE CASE OF SAND
DAY THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT FROM NOW ON THE FOURTH OF JULY WILL BE REMEMBERED NOT AS THE DAY OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE BUT AS THE DAY
ALLEY BUT WHICHEVER IT TURNS OUT TO BE THERE IS ONE THING I'M SURE OF THE JOURNEY WILL BE FULL OF SURPRISES
TIME WERE FILLED BY THIS HIGGS STATE
ALL ATOMIC MATTER WOULD COLLAPSE
NO MOLECULAR STRUCTURES WOULD BE POSSIBLE NO LIFE
SO I WONDER
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IN THE FUTURE THE HIGGS FIELD WILL
MUCH MORE BUT FOR THE MOMENT SINCE WE HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR NEW PHENOMENA LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE PARTICLES THAT WE
WHY I AM INTERESTED IN THE TRANSITION OF THE HIGGS FIELD IS BECAUSE I WANT TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION WHY
IS THE HIGGS BOSON MASS SO SPECIAL
WHY IS IT JUST RIGHT TO KEEP THE UNIVERSE AT THE EDGE OF A PHASE TRANSITION
FIELD WILL UNDERGO A PHASE TRANSITION AND MATTER WILL COLLAPSE INTO
BE STANDING ON A KNIFE EDGE
READY
FOR COSMIC COLLAPSE AND WE DISCOVERED THAT THIS MAY BE A HINT
THAT OUR UNIVERSE IS ONLY A GRAIN OF SAND
IN A GIANT BEACH
THE MULTIVERSE
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF MY HYPOTHESIS IS RIGHT
THAT'S HOW PHYSICS
LONG GONE BY THEN IN ABOUT FIVE BILLION
A POTENTIAL PROBLEM THIS IS BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE
VERDICT IS NOT DEFINITIVE IN 2015 THE
AND EXCEPT MATTER
WE CAN SEE MATTER BUT WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER
AS IN THIS CRYPTIC SENTENCE I FOUND IN THE GUARDIAN RECENTLY
THE MARRIAGE SUFFERED A SETBACK IN 1965 WHEN THE HUSBAND WAS KILLED BY THE WIFE
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT INVISIBILITY IS THAT THINGS THAT WE CAN'T SEE WE ALSO CAN'T UNDERSTAND
GRAVITY IS ONE THING THAT WE CAN'T SEE AND WHICH WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD OF ALL THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES AND THE WEAKEST
AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT IT IS WHY IT'S THERE FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH SIR ISAAC NEWTON THE GREATEST SCIENTIST WHO EVER LIVED
HE THOUGHT JESUS CAME TO EARTH SPECIFICALLY TO OPERATE THE LEVERS OF GRAVITY THAT'S WHAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS THERE FOR
SO BRIGHT GUY COULD BE WRONG ON THAT ONE I DON'T KNOW
CONSCIOUSNESS
I SEE ALL
WHAT I'VE GOT IT DOWN TO IS THERE ARE ONLY TWO QUESTIONS REALLY WORTH ASKING WHY ARE WE HERE
AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT WHILE WE ARE
AND
TO HELP YOU I'VE GOT TWO THINGS TO LEAVE YOU WITH FROM TWO GREAT PHILOSOPHERS PERHAPS TWO OF THE GREATEST PHILOSOPHER THINKERS OF THE 20TH CENTURY ONE MATHEMATICIAN AND AN ENGINEER AND THE OTHER A
THE MORE LIGHT THERE IS THE LESS YOU CAN SEE TIME NOBODY CAN SEE TIME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS MODERN PHYSICS THERE IS A
ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY STARTED DELVING INTO THE GENOME THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN AROUND
THAT'S INVISIBLE TO US IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IT IS INCREDIBLE HOW LITTLE WE KNOW
NOT ONLY IS SHE AWARE OF HER PHYSICAL REPULSIVENESS SHE TURNS IT TO HER ADVANTAGE
A PHOTO IS NOT ENOUGH
SO HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT PLASTIC FRAME TO PUT THE PHOTOGRAPH IN AND ON THE PHOTOGRAPH HE WROTE WITH A FLOURISH TO HORSE FACE WITH LOVE FROM GEOFFREY DICKENS M P AFTER
IT HAD BEEN SENT OFF HIS SECRETARY SAID TO HIM
DID YOU GET THAT LETTER FROM THE WOMAN AT THE FETE I WROTE HORSE FACE ON HER SO YOU'D REMEMBER WHO SHE WAS
IN MODERN PHYSICS TO DECIDE THAT TIME DOESN'T REALLY EXIST BECAUSE IT'S TOO INCONVENIENT FOR THE FIGURES IT'S MUCH EASIER IF IT'S NOT REALLY THERE YOU CAN'T SEE THE FUTURE
OBVIOUSLY AND YOU CAN'T SEE THE PAST EXCEPT IN YOUR MEMORY ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE PAST IS YOU PARTICULARLY CAN'T SEE MY SON
ASKED ME THIS THE OTHER DAY HE SAID DAD CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT I WAS LIKE WHEN I WAS TWO AND I SAID YES AND HE SAID WHY CAN'T I
ISN'T THAT EXTRAORDINARY YOU CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
EARLIER THAN THE AGE OF TWO OR THREE
WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR PSYCHOANALYSTS
SO MANY THINGS THAT LIGHT
YOU CAN'T SEE LIGHT WHEN IT'S DARK IN A VACUUM
IF A PERSON SHINES A BEAM OF LIGHT STRAIGHT ACROSS YOUR EYES YOU WON'T SEE IT SLIGHTLY TECHNICAL SOME PHYSICISTS WILL DISAGREE WITH THIS BUT IT'S ODD THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THE BEAM OF LIGHT YOU CAN ONLY SEE WHAT IT HITS
I FIND THAT EXTRAORDINARY NOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE LIGHT NOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE DARKNESS
ELECTRICITY YOU CAN'T SEE THAT DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THEY UNDERSTAND ELECTRICITY THEY DON'T NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS
YOU PROBABLY THINK THE
AND LASTLY W H AUDEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE POETS WHO SAID WE ARE HERE ON EARTH TO HELP OTHERS WHAT THE OTHERS ARE HERE FOR I'VE NO IDEA {LG}
NOBODY EVER WILL THEY'RE SMALLER THAN THE WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT GAS YOU CAN'T SEE THAT INTERESTING SOMEBODY
OTHERWISE THEY'D BE OUT OF A JOB BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE STUFF HAPPENS
THAT MAKES YOU WHO YOU ARE
ANOTHER THING YOU CAN'T SEE IS THE GRID ON WHICH WE HANG THIS IS FASCINATING YOU PROBABLY KNOW SOME OF YOU THAT CELLS ARE CONTINUALLY RENEWED YOU CAN SEE IT IN SKIN AND THIS KIND OF STUFF SKIN FLAKES OFF
HAIRS GROW NAILS
GALAXIES 100 BILLION OF THEM ESTIMATED IN THE UNIVERSE 100 BILLION
WHICH SOME CLAIM IS THE ROUTE OF ALL RELIGIONS SUFI MASTERS ARE ALL TELEPATHS
SO THEY SAY
BUT THEIR MAIN EXERCISE OF TELEPATHY IS TO SEND OUT POWERFUL SIGNALS TO THE REST OF US THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST
SO THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THINK IT EXISTS THE SUFI MASTERS WORKING ON US
IN THE QUESTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS REALLY LIKE THE STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS GOTTEN NOWHERE WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS
WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE NOT ONLY HAVE THEY NOT CREATED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THEY HAVEN'T YET CREATED ARTIFICIAL STUPIDITY
THAT WE CAN'T READ EACH OTHER'S MINDS BUT WE CAN TOUCH EACH OTHER TASTE EACH OTHER PERHAPS IF WE GET CLOSE ENOUGH BUT WE CAN'T READ
THE FIRST IS LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN WHO SAID I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ARE HERE BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT IN ORDER TO ENJOY OURSELVES
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS INVISIBLE THERE IS MORE OF IT THAN YOU THINK ACTUALLY EVERYTHING I WOULD SAY EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS EXCEPT EVERY THING
OF STUFF BUT EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY IS REPLACED AT SOME POINT
TASTE BUDS EVERY 10 DAYS OR SO
LIVERS AND INTERNAL ORGANS SORT OF TAKE A BIT LONGER A SPINE TAKES SEVERAL YEARS BUT AT THE END OF SEVEN YEARS NOT ONE CELL IN YOUR BODY
REMAINS FROM WHAT WAS THERE SEVEN YEARS AGO THE QUESTION IS WHO THEN ARE WE WHAT ARE WE
WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WE HANG ON THAT IS ACTUALLY US
OKAY ATOMS YOU CAN'T SEE
WRITTEN IN BRACKETS WAS THE APT DESCRIPTION HORSE FACE {LG} I'VE MISJUDGED THIS WOMEN THOUGHT MR
OF THESE HEINRICH WHAT'S THE POINT OF THESE RADIO WAVES THAT YOU'VE FOUND AND HE SAID WELL I'VE NO IDEA BUT I GUESS SOMEBODY WILL FIND A USE FOR THEM SOMEDAY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO RADIO THAT'S WHAT THEY
WE CAN'T SEE IS THE HUMAN GENOME AND THIS IS INCREASINGLY PECULIAR BECAUSE
OF THINGS WE CAN'T SEE INTO THE ENGINE ROOM WE CAN'T SEE WHAT MAKES PEOPLE TICK
AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THE CLOSER WE LOOK AT ANYTHING
THE MORE IT DISAPPEARS
IN FACT IF YOU LOOK REALLY CLOSELY AT STUFF IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC SUBSTRUCTURE OF MATTER
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THERE ELECTRONS DISAPPEAR IN KIND OF FUZZ AND THERE IS ONLY ENERGY AND YOU CAN'T SEE ENERGY
SO EVERYTHING
TO 1894 WHEN THE EMINENT PHYSICIST ALBERT MICHELSON SAID THE FOLLOWING
AS GRAND HISTORICAL STRAIGHT MEN SO WE CAN LOOK BACK 100 YEARS LATER AND MARVEL AT HOW COMPLETELY
IT'S DARK BECAUSE IT INTERACTS SO SLIGHTLY WITH OUR EVERYDAY ELECTROMAGNETIC WORLD THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY BEEN HIDDEN FROM ALL PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS
THING WE DID THIS FOR THE APEX EXPERIMENT IN JULY OF 2010 WHERE WE HELD THE TEST
ENERGIES MANKIND HAS EVER USED IN COLLIDER EXPERIMENTS 13
THERE MUCH LIKE IN HIKING YOU LOOK AT HILL AND THINK I WONDER WHAT COULD BE IN THAT NEXT HIDDEN VALLEY WE PUSH THE LIMITS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE WE'RE CURIOUS
BE ABLE TO TAKE DARK PHOTONS WITH YOUR PHONE POSSIBLY PROBABLY NOT I'M THE WRONG PERSON TO ASK BECAUSE I'M AN EXPERIMENTALIST NOT PRODUCT
PET SCANS MAJOR ADVANCES IN RF POWER THE WORLD WIDE WEB I'VE NO IDEA WHAT THE DISCOVERY OF A DARK PHOTON WILL MEAN BEYOND EXPANDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE THE REST OF IT WILL BE UP TO
THINK DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE I JUST SAID THAT TO GET TO THE HIGHER MASSES WE NEED MORE MONEY SO WHY HAVEN'T WE COVERED THE BROKE END OF THE SPECTRUM ALREADY
ESSENTIALLY A LIST OF ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES WE KNOW AND THE WAYS THEY INTERACT IT'S NICELY
ON THIS ONE THING IT'S BECAUSE THIS DARK' ACTUALLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH DARK
GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT I MEAN BY SHOWING YOU AN AERIAL VIEW OF THE LARGE
YOU THE AMOUNT OF LUMINOUS MATTER IN THE GALAXY PULL
AN ODDBALL BECAUSE IT HAS THREE DIFFERENT FORCE CARRYING PARTICLES ASSOCIATED WITH IT THE W PLUS W MINUS AND Z BOSONS
THEY HAVE SEEN SOME WEIRD THINGS I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO IT HERE BUT I'LL JUST TELL YOU YOU GET THE DARK MATTER EXPERIMENTALISTS INTO THE
TEXTBOOK ON GRAVITY AND PUT THAT NUMBER INTO THE EQUATION THAT TELLS YOU HOW FAST
THAT THE ONLY WAY NO ONE OF THE VERY VERY FEW WAYS WE COULD HAVE MISSED PHYSICAL FORCES IS IF THEY HAVE A VERY SMALL
I WONDER IF PEOPLE LIKE THIS MICHELSON DIDN'T NEED TO HE WAS ABOUT TO GET THE
YES ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THESE ARE EXPERIMENTS AND IN PARTICLE PHYSICS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FAILURE
NAME THE KANYE PARTICLE' SORRY THE GOD
THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF SOME OF THESE EXPERIMENTS TO GET UP TO HIGHER ENERGIES WHERE THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY PHYSICS MAY BE HIDING WE NEED TO BUILD BIGGER MACHINES
COMPLETE PICTURE IT IS AMAZINGLY SUCCESSFUL BUT IT CANNOT BE THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF NATURE AT ITS FUNDAMENTAL SCALES
IT'S SO EXPERIMENTALLY SUCCESSFUL THAT ANY NEW THING THAT COMES HAS TO BUILD UPON IT IT STILL HAS TO BE TRUE AT THE
REQUIRED A COMPLETE PARADIGM SHIFT IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NATURE AT ITS VERY BASIC SCALES THAT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW MICHELSON COULD HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG
YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT BUT WE DID RULE OUT A SMALL SPACE WHERE ONE CAN LIVE WE PROVED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE EXPERIMENT WHICH WILL HAPPEN SOMETIME IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS LIKE I
AS THE ELECTRON BENDS AROUND THIS NUCLEUS IT SPITS OFF ANOTHER PHOTON WHICH SPLITS INTO A COUPLE OF PARTICLES THAT WE CAN DETECT THEN WE DETECT THOSE PARTICLES WE CALCULATE THE MASS OF THE PARTICLE THEY CAME FROM AND THEN WE BEND THOSE UP
IT'S POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE FIRST UNAMBIGUOUS EVIDENCE OF A FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLE NOT PREDICTED BY THE WIDELY SUCCESSFUL STANDARD MODEL THAT WE'RE NOW IN
THIS DEVELOPMENT OF THE STANDARD MODEL IN THE 20TH CENTURY LED US TO UNDERSTAND THERE WERE OTHER FUNDAMENTAL FORCES THAT WE HAD MISSED BEFORE AND ONE OF THEM IS THE STRONG FORCE
THEN THE NEED TO UNIFY QUANTUM MECHANICS WITH RELATIVITY LED TO QUANTUM FIELD THEORY ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS BY
THIS IS GOOD WE CAN DO THIS THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE EVERYWHERE THEY'RE IN RUSSIA THEY'RE IN GERMANY THEY'RE IN ITALY THEY'RE IN CALIFORNIA
KNOW ABOUT IT SO IF NATURE HAD FOR
THE BEAM COMES IN OVER MY HEAD GOES INTO THIS TARGETING
OF THEM WE DON'T KNOW THERE ACTUALLY COULD BE OTHER FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OUT THERE BUT
TO HIDE SOME NEW FORCE FROM US A NEW FORCE CARRYING PARTICLE THAT HAD A VERY VERY SMALL MASS AND IT ALSO INTERACTED REALLY SLIGHTLY WITH OUR EVERYDAY ELECTROMAGNETIC WORLD SO SLIGHTLY WE'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE
THAT'S A DARK PHOTON I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CREATE THAT IN A COLLIDER
THERE WERE A NEW FORCE CARRYING PARTICLE THAT HAD A MASS LITTLE LESS THAN THE MASS OF THE PROTON AND IF IT INTERACTED REALLY REALLY SLIGHTLY WITH OUR EVERYDAY WORLD
THE RULES CHANGE BECAUSE QUANTUM FIELD THEORY TAKES OVER AND YOU CAN'T THINK OF COLLISIONS IN THE SAME WAY SO INSTEAD
SMALLEST POSSIBLE THINGS IN NATURE AND WE ACCELERATE THEM UP TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SPEEDS AND WE SLAM THEM INTO EACH OTHER TO SEE WHAT
CARRYING PARTICLES IS IF THEY ARE JUST SUPER MASSIVE WE HAVEN'T BUILT A LARGE ENOUGH COLLIDER WITH ENOUGH ENERGY TO GET UP THERE WE HAVE TO BUILD A LARGER COLLIDER TO GET TO HIGHER ENERGIES AND FIND NEW
WHEN YOUR CAMERA TAKES A PHOTO PLEASE IF YOU HAVE CAMERAS TAKE THEM OUT AND TAKE A PHOTO OF ME POSING LIKE
THE VERY SMALLEST FUNDAMENTAL SCALES THE SMALLEST UNCUTTABLE PARTICLE SCALES AND IF WE WANT TO GO UP TO THE HIGHEST SPEEDS POSSIBLE ALMOST THE SPEED OF
YEARS LATER WE'VE FINALLY REACHED MICHELSON'S DREAM OF END OF PHYSICS IS THIS WHAT WE SAID TO EACH OTHER ABSOLUTELY NOT
ONE WAY IS IF THE PARTICLES ARE SUPER MASSIVE WHAT I MEAN BY MASS IS NOT THE TYPICAL MASSIVE BOUNCER AT A BAR TYPE COLLOQUIAL SENSE
THE PARTICLE LEVEL IS AN INTRINSIC PROPERTY OF A PARTICLE
WHERE A DARK PHOTON SHOULD LIVE IF IT'S GOING TO HELP EXPLAIN THESE DARK MATTER ANOMALIES FLASH FORWARD TO
MOST ENERGETIC PHOTONS WE KNOW OF COME FROM ASTROPHYSICAL SOURCES LIKE HYPER
A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT PHOTONS IN ADDITION TO ALL THESE THINGS IT'S ALSO A SPECIAL TYPE OF FORCE CARRYING PARTICLE TO
SUCH A GIGANTIC BREAKTHROUGH THERE WAS PREVALENT ATTITUDE AMONGST A LOT OF PHYSICISTS THAT THIS WAS PRETTY MUCH IT AND THE REST WERE SOME MINOR
NEW PHYSICS THE BARRIER WE FACE NOW IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IT'S THE QUESTION OF HOW TO KEEP SEARCHING FOR A NEW
THIS INTERPLAY BETWEEN THEORY AND EXPERIMENT AND THESE AMAZING PARADIGM SHIFTS THAT HAPPEN IN THE 20TH CENTURY ALSO WENT OVER TO OTHER RELATED
IT'S THE ONLY ONE WE CAN DO ANYTHING DIRECTLY WITH IN TERMS OF INSTRUMENTATION IF SOME
VERY BRIGHT AND COHERENT PHOTONS MAKE UP LASERS SOME OF THE DIMMEST PHOTONS WE KNOW ARE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN TRAVELING FOR 14 BILLION YEARS FROM A
THEN THE MOST MASSIVE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLE WE KNOW OF IS THE TOP QUARK AND IT HAS MASS OF ABOUT 172 TIMES
THAT THE ONLY DIRECTION WE CAN GO IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAPPEN THIS IS BEING PLANNED THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE THING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT IS THAT THE ONLY DIRECTION WE CAN
MICHELSON S POSITING THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER WE SHOULD EVEN BOTHER TO KEEP SEARCHING FOR
HAD THIS AMAZING INTERPLAY BETWEEN THEORY AND EXPERIMENT IN PHYSICS IN THE 20TH CENTURY THAT CULMINATED IN THIS THING THAT WE CALL THE STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE
FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND HE SAID THE MORE IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND FACTS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE HAVE ALL BEEN DISCOVERED AND THESE ARE NOW SO FIRMLY ESTABLISHED THE
WE LIKE TO KEEP TRACK OF THINGS AS THEY EVOLVE IN TIME SO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS SAME COLLISION ON A BILLIARD TABLE AS IT EVOLVES IN
WE MARRIED A FEW MONTHS LATER AND THIS WAS THE TRIP WHERE WE REALLY WENT TO SEE THE ANIMALS AND TO SEE THE SAVANNA IT WAS INCREDIBLE BILL HAD NEVER TAKEN THAT MUCH TIME OFF FROM WORK BUT WHAT REALLY
WOULD BE OUR PHILANTHROPY MG WHICH BILL ALWAYS THOUGHT WAS GOING TO COME AFTER HE WAS 60 SO HE HASN'T QUITE HIT
WOULD HAVE SO MANY KIDS THAT THEY'D GET HUGE POPULATION GROWTH AND THAT THE KIDS
A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT WITHOUT MUCH PRIOR ART
THAT WE'D PICK TWO CAUSES WHATEVER THE BIGGEST INEQUITY WAS GLOBALLY AND THERE WE LOOKED AT CHILDREN DYING CHILDREN NOT HAVING ENOUGH NUTRITION TO EVER DEVELOP AND COUNTRIES THAT WERE REALLY STUCK BECAUSE WITH THAT LEVEL OF DEATH AND
QUITE CONVINCED THAT IT WASN'T A FAVOR EITHER TO SOCIETY OR TO THE KIDS CA WELL SPEAKING OF WARREN
USING THE SCIENCE OF NEW VACCINES GETTING THE VACCINES OUT TO KIDS WE CAN ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THE PROGRESS THE LAST DECADE
YOUR FOUNDATION HOW ON EARTH DID THAT HAPPEN I GUESS THERE'S A LONG VERSION AND A SHORT VERSION OF THAT WE'VE GOT TIME
YOU NEVER KNOW MG
WELL HERE'S THE THING WE COME AT THINGS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD SO BILL CAN LOOK AT THE BIG DATA AND SAY I WANT TO ACT BASED ON THESE GLOBAL STATISTICS FOR ME I COME AT IT FROM INTUITION I MEET WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND BILL'S TAUGHT ME TO TAKE THAT AND
IS WILLING TO DO IT AT NO
CHARGE
MAYBE THAT'S OKAY BUT WE WERE STUNNED MG TOTALLY STUNNED BG WE HAD NEVER EXPECTED IT AND IT HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE IT'S ALLOWED US TO
INCREASE OUR AMBITION IN WHAT THE FOUNDATION CAN DO QUITE
VERSION BG ALL RIGHT
WELL WARREN WAS A CLOSE FRIEND AND HE WAS
GOING TO HAVE HIS WIFE SUZIE GIVE IT ALL AWAY
TRAGICALLY SHE PASSED AWAY BEFORE HE DID
AND HE'S BIG ON DELEGATION
AND
HOW HAVE YOU MANAGED IT WHAT'S BEEN YOUR APPROACH BG
WELL I'D SAY OVERALL
THE KIDS GET A GREAT EDUCATION BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A SENSE OF THEIR OWN ABILITY AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO AND DO
AND OUR PHILOSOPHY HAS
BEEN TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH THEM MOST OF THE MONEY'S GOING TO THE FOUNDATION AND HELP THEM FIND SOMETHING THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT WE WANT TO STRIKE A BALANCE WHERE THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DO ANYTHING BUT NOT A LOT OF MONEY SHOWERED ON THEM SO THEY
COULD GO OUT AND DO NOTHING
AND SO FAR THEY'RE
FAIRLY DILIGENT EXCITED TO PICK THEIR OWN DIRECTION
CA YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
THE GOVERNMENT SCHOOL YET HE SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO PAY FOR HER EDUCATION I CAN'T PAY FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL AND SHE MAY END UP ON THIS FARM LIKE MY WIFE SO THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE THAT AN EDUCATION CAN MAKE IN A HUGE PROFOUND WAY CA I MEAN THIS IS
BILL
GATES
WELL I THINK WE WERE
EXCITED THAT THERE'D BE A PHASE OF OUR LIFE WHERE WE'D GET TO
WORK TOGETHER AND
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE THIS MONEY BACK
AT
THIS STAGE WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE POOREST AND COULD YOU HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THEM WERE THERE THINGS THAT WEREN'T BEING DONE THERE WAS A LOT WE DIDN'T KNOW OUR NA VET IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE WHEN WE LOOK
GLOBAL THING AND THEN
IN THE U S BOTH OF US HAVE HAD AMAZING EDUCATIONS AND WE SAW THAT AS THE WAY THAT THE U S COULD LIVE UP
TO ITS PROMISE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS BY HAVING A PHENOMENAL EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE MORE WE LEARNED THE MORE WE REALIZED WE'RE NOT REALLY FULFILLING THAT PROMISE AND SO WE PICKED THOSE TWO THINGS
AND EVERYTHING THE FOUNDATION DOES
IS FOCUSED THERE CA
HUSBAND I'M EITHER SUGGESTING HE HAS AIDS OR I HAVE AIDS AND I NEED THAT TOOL BECAUSE THEN I CAN SPACE THE BIRTHS OF MY CHILDREN AND I CAN FEED THEM AND HAVE A CHANCE OF EDUCATING THEM CA
CHARITY WHEN THEY SEE NATURAL DISASTER ARE WONDERFUL IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW PEOPLE THINK OKAY THAT COULD BE ME AND THE MONEY FLOWS
WERE STOCKED IN IN AFRICA BECAUSE OF ALL THE AIDS WORK THAT THE U S AND OTHERS
ABOUT MG
SO I ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE TO DO WHEN I TRAVEL IS TO GO OUT TO THE RURAL AREAS AND TALK TO THE WOMEN WHETHER IT'S BANGLADESH INDIA LOTS OF COUNTRIES IN AFRICA AND I GO IN AS A WESTERN WOMAN WITHOUT NAME I DON'T TELL THEM WHO I AM PAIR OF KHAKIS
AND I KEPT HEARING FROM WOMEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER THE MORE I TRAVELED I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS
IT'S THE MOST FULFILLING THING WE'VE EVER DONE
AND YOU
CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU AND IF IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOUR
KIDS LET'S GET TOGETHER AND BRAINSTORM ABOUT WHAT WE CAN BE DONE THE WORLD IS A FAR BETTER PLACE BECAUSE OF THE PHILANTHROPISTS OF THE PAST
AND THE U S TRADITION HERE WHICH IS THE STRONGEST IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AND PART OF THE REASON I'M SO OPTIMISTIC IS BECAUSE I DO THINK PHILANTHROPY IS GOING TO
HAD BACKED AWAY FROM CONTRACEPTIVES AS A GLOBAL COMMUNITY WE KNEW THAT 210 MILLION WOMEN WERE SAYING THEY WANTED ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTIVES EVEN THE CONTRACEPTIVES WE HAVE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
AND WE WEREN'T PROVIDING THEM BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL CONTROVERSY IN OUR COUNTRY
AND TO ME THAT WAS JUST A CRIME
FOUNDATION ITSELF STARTED MA YEAH IN 97 WE READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT DIARRHEAL DISEASES KILLING SO MANY KIDS AROUND THE WORLD AND WE KEPT SAYING TO OURSELVES WELL THAT CAN'T BE IN THE U S YOU JUST GO DOWN TO THE DRUG STORE AND SO WE STARTED GATHERING SCIENTISTS AND STARTED LEARNING ABOUT POPULATION LEARNING ABOUT VACCINES LEARNING ABOUT WHAT HAD WORKED AND WHAT HAD FAILED AND THAT'S
THAT ACTUALLY IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE BG YEAH WELL PEOPLE CAN TAKE THERE IS SOME AID THAT WAS WELL MEANING AND DIDN'T GO WELL THERE'S SOME VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WERE WELL MEANING AND DIDN'T
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHERE ONE OF US HAD A SUPER STRONG OPINION ABOUT ONE THING
BUT IT GOT ACCELERATED SO THAT WAS 93 AND IT WAS
NOT JUST GOOD AT WORKING ON AND DISCOVERING AND SHINE SOME LIGHT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION CA THE
EASILY GOT ENOUGH MONEY DESPITE YOUR VAST CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FOUNDATION TO MAKE THEM ALL
YOU TALK ABOUT A FAILURE AND MAYBE WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED FROM IT BG
YEAH FORTUNATELY WE CAN AFFORD A FEW FAILURES BECAUSE WE'VE CERTAINLY HAD THEM
WE DO LOT OF
DRUG WORK OR VACCINE WORK THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE
DIFFERENT FAILURES LIKE WE PUT OUT ONE THAT GOT A LOT OF PUBLICITY WAS ASKING FOR BETTER CONDOM WELL WE GOT HUNDREDS OF IDEAS MAYBE A FEW OF THOSE WILL
WORK OUT
AND I THINK WHAT I'VE TAUGHT HIM IS TO TAKE THAT DATA AND MEET WITH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO UNDERSTAND CAN YOU ACTUALLY DELIVER THAT VACCINE CAN YOU GET A WOMAN TO ACCEPT THOSE POLIO DROPS IN HER CHILD'S MOUTH BECAUSE THE DELIVERY PIECE IS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT AS THE SCIENCE SO I THINK IT'S BEEN MORE A COMING
IS THAT YOUR PLAN FOR THEM BG NOPE
NO THEY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEY NEED TO
HAVE A SENSE THAT THEIR OWN WORK IS MEANINGFUL AND
IMPORTANT
WE READ AN ARTICLE LONG ACTUALLY BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED WHERE WARREN BUFFETT
TO PHILANTHROPY HOW THEY INVOLVE THEIR KIDS WHERE THEY'RE DOING IT DIFFERENTLY AND IT'S BEEN WAY MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN WE EXPECTED NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL JUST KEEP GROWING IN
AN AIRLINER WITH 200 PLUS DEATHS IS A FAR FAR BIGGER STORY THAN THAT DOES THAT DRIVE YOU CRAZY BG YEAH
ABOUT 120 PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOW TAKEN THIS GIVING PLEDGE
THE THING THAT'S GREAT IS THAT WE GET TOGETHER YEARLY AND TALK ABOUT OKAY DO YOU HIRE STAFF WHAT DO YOU GIVE TO THEM WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HOMOGENIZE IT I MEAN THE BEAUTY OF PHILANTHROPY IS THIS MIND BLOWING DIVERSITY
PEOPLE GIVE TO SOME THINGS WE LOOK AND GO WOW BUT THAT'S
MG YEAH I THINK ACTUALLY
FOR THE FOUNDATION EMPLOYEES THERE WAS WAY MORE ANGST FOR THEM THAN THERE WAS FOR ME ABOUT BILL COMING I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITED I MEAN BILL MADE THIS DECISION EVEN OBVIOUSLY BEFORE IT GOT ANNOUNCED IN 2006 AND IT WAS REALLY HIS DECISION BUT AGAIN IT WAS A BEACH VACATION WHERE WE WERE WALKING ON THE BEACH AND HE WAS STARTING TO THINK OF THIS IDEA
AND FOR ME THE EXCITEMENT OF BILL PUTTING HIS BRAIN AND HIS HEART AGAINST THESE HUGE GLOBAL PROBLEMS THESE INEQUITIES TO ME THAT WAS
A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS WHAT I DID WAS I ASKED BILL AND
VERY SHY
SO SHE KEPT WANTING TO TALK TO ME AND JENN WE KEPT TRYING TO ENGAGE HER BUT SHE WAS SHY
AND AT NIGHT THOUGH WHEN ALL THE LIGHTS WENT OUT IN RURAL TANZANIA AND THERE WAS NO MOON THAT NIGHT THE FIRST NIGHT AND NO STARS AND JENN CAME OUT OF OUR HUT WITH HER REI LITTLE HEADLAMP ON
GRACE WENT IMMEDIATELY AND GOT THE TRANSLATOR CAME STRAIGHT UP TO MY JENN AND SAID
WHEN YOU GO HOME CAN I HAVE YOUR HEADLAMP SO I CAN STUDY AT
TO THE CURRENT MEME THAT AID IS KIND OF WORTHLESS
YEARS AGO I GUESS BILL CAME ON FULL TIME SO MOVED FROM MICROSOFT AND BECAME FULL TIME THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD
AND THEY WOULD BRING THE CONVERSATION AROUND TO BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SHOT I GET
AN INJECTION EVERY DAY FOR 10 DAYS IT TOOK THREE MORE YEARS TO GET IT THAN WE EXPECTED AND THEN THERE WAS NO WAY IT WAS GOING TO GET OUT THERE
FORTUNATELY WE FOUND OUT THAT IF YOU GO KILL THE SAND FLIES YOU PROBABLY CAN HAVE SUCCESS THERE BUT WE SPENT FIVE YEARS YOU COULD SAY WASTED FIVE YEARS AND ABOUT 60 MILLION
ON A PATH THAT TURNED OUT TO HAVE VERY MODEST BENEFIT WHEN WE GOT THERE CA YOU'RE
THOUGHT THAT THESE SMALL SCHOOLS WERE THE ANSWER AND SMALL SCHOOLS DEFINITELY HELP THEY BRING DOWN THE DROPOUT RATE THEY HAVE LESS VIOLENCE AND CRIME IN THOSE SCHOOLS BUT THE THING THAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT WORK AND WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL KEY IS A GREAT TEACHER IN FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN
PEOPLE ARE MAKING CHANGE WITH PHILANTHROPY I MEAN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
CREATED THEIR OWN BUSINESSES PUT THEIR OWN INGENUITY BEHIND INCREDIBLE IDEAS IF THEY PUT THEIR IDEAS AND THEIR BRAIN BEHIND PHILANTHROPY THEY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD AND THEY START TO SEE OTHERS DOING IT AND SAYING WOW I WANT TO DO THAT WITH MY OWN MONEY TO ME THAT'S THE PIECE
HOW HAVE YOU GUYS MANAGED IT MG YEAH I'VE HAD A LOT OF WOMEN SAY TO ME I REALLY DON'T THINK I COULD WORK WITH MY HUSBAND THAT JUST WOULDN'T WORK OUT
YOU
KNOW WE ENJOY IT AND WE DON'T
THIS FOUNDATION HAS BEEN A COMING TO FOR BOTH OF US IN ITS CONTINUOUS LEARNING JOURNEY
AND WE DON'T TRAVEL TOGETHER AS MUCH FOR
FOR THE FOUNDATION ACTUALLY AS WE USED TO WHEN BILL WAS WORKING AT MICROSOFT WE HAVE MORE TRIPS WHERE WE'RE TRAVELING SEPARATELY BUT I ALWAYS KNOW WHEN I COME HOME BILL'S GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN WHAT I LEARNED WHETHER IT'S ABOUT WOMEN OR GIRLS OR SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE VACCINE DELIVERY
WHAT MIGHT WE DO AND HOW MIGHT WE GO ABOUT IT CA SO GIVEN
IS A STORY LARGELY OF VACCINES SMALLPOX WAS KILLING COUPLE MILLION KIDS A YEAR THAT WAS ERADICATED SO THAT GOT DOWN TO ZERO MEASLES WAS KILLING COUPLE MILLION A
EMBROILED IN CONTROVERSY OVER THIS ISSUE AND ON THE ABORTION
ARGUMENT
BG BECAUSE WE BUILT THIS THING TOGETHER FROM THE BEGINNING IT'S
THIS GREAT PARTNERSHIP
I HAD THAT WITH PAUL ALLEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MICROSOFT I HAD IT WITH STEVE BALLMER AS MICROSOFT GOT BIGGER AND NOW MELINDA
AND IN EVEN STRONGER EQUAL WAYS IS THE PARTNER SO WE TALK A LOT ABOUT WHICH THINGS SHOULD WE GIVE MORE TO WHICH GROUPS ARE WORKING WELL SHE'S
TEACHING THEM THEY HAVE BEEN TO SO MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THEY'RE SAYING WE DO WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT WE BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING MOM AND DAD AND IT IS
WE DON'T HAVE A PERFECT RECORD
THIS IS A BAD ENDEAVOR YOU SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL HOW ARE YOU TRYING TO UPLIFT NUTRITION AND SURVIVAL AND LITERACY SO THESE COUNTRIES CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND SAY WOW THIS IS GOING WELL
AND BE SMARTER WE CAN SPEND AID SMARTER IT IS NOT ALL A PANACEA WE CAN DO BETTER THAN VENTURE CAPITAL I THINK
FOR HALF A DAY OR THREE QUARTERS OF A DAY VERSUS STAYING OVERNIGHT WAS PROFOUND AND SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU
ARE SEEING SOME INCREASED GENEROSITY SO THE GOAL IS TO GET THIS WELL BELOW MILLION WHICH SHOULD BE POSSIBLE IN OUR LIFETIME CA MAYBE IT
PERSON THAT WOULD GET THIS BACK ON THE GLOBAL STAGE AND I FINALLY REALIZED I JUST HAD TO DO IT AND EVEN THOUGH I'M CATHOLIC I BELIEVE IN CONTRACEPTIVES JUST LIKE MOST OF THE CATHOLIC WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES WHO REPORT USING CONTRACEPTIVES AND I SHOULDN'T LET THAT CONTROVERSY
A WORLD FULL OF SO MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES HOW ON EARTH DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO FOCUS ON BG WELL
US ACTUALLY WERE THE PEOPLE AND THE EXTREME POVERTY WE STARTED ASKING OURSELVES QUESTIONS DOES IT HAVE
REALLY INTERESTED AND I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP BUT WE DON'T EVERY MINUTE TOGETHER THAT'S FOR SURE
AND WE REALIZE THIS IS WHO WE ARE AND ON SOME POINT MUCH LATER ON
IMAGES OF THE MEDIA OF WHAT THEY DEEM BEAUTIFUL AND THIS CONCEPT OF
CHICKENS DEEM BEAUTIFUL
NOW THE HUMANS HAVE BEEN CONDITIONED BY SOCIETY AND THE MEDIA
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHICKENS
DOES THIS MEAN THAT THOSE WHO HAVE SELF IMAGE
PROBLEMS ARE DOOMED
DOES MY DOG LOOK AT ME WITH AFFECTION BECAUSE
I'M BEAUTIFUL OR BECAUSE HE WANTS A TREAT
IS
OF US DO THIS WHY IS IT THAT WE ONLY JUDGE PEOPLE ON THEIR OUTER WORKINGS WELL IT'S WHAT WE ARE TAUGHT TO DO WE ARE
NOT TO BE SELF CRITICAL EVEN HYPERCRITICAL
TO BELIEVE BECAUSE THE MIRROR HELD UP BY OURSELVES ISN'T JUST THE ONE ON OUR
THE INSECURITIES AND THE DOUBTS AND THE FEELINGS THAT IN YOUR VOICE TELL YOU YOU'RE NOT GOOD
HAD NICE EYES NO ACNE AND WERE ALWAYS SMILING I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT PEOPLE WHO I DEEMED MORE
AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST HAVE TRIED TO LOSE WEIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT ALL WRESTLERS
EVERY MORNING WHEN WE WAKE UP ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WE SEE
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE ALL DEEM BEAUTIFUL THAT COMES FROM WITHIN AND IT'S
WHEN YOU STAND IN FRONT OF A MIRROR DO YOU JUDGE YOURSELF DO YOU FEEL CONTENT WITH YOURSELF IT'S
APPEARANCES AND NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR INNER BEAUTY IF EVEN SUCH THING EXISTED IN MY THEN 14 YEAR OLD CONSCIOUSNESS WAS I GUILTY OF BEING SHALLOW AND SUPERFICIAL
TO REALIZE THIS IS WHO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT WHAT'S YOUR FIRST
{LG} BECAUSE IT WASN'T TOO LONG BEFORE I WAS BANNED FROM USING HOSE WATER IN THE SAND BOX I WAS DEVASTATED AT FIRST BUT THEN DETERMINED TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY AND I
BUT ALL YEAR ROUND WE STILL HAD THESE SPONGE LIKE FORESTS ALONG THE RIVER THAT WOULD ABSORB THAT RAIN AND PLANT IN THE LIVING
OF MULCH WHICH RAPIDLY ABSORB THE WATER SO WE DON'T LOSE IT TO EVAPORATION AND NOR DO WE HAVE PUDDLES OR
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT THE SAME WAY WE ALL CAN WITH LONG AND THOUGHTFUL OBSERVATION SO EVERY TIME IT RAINED HE'D BE OUT THERE RUNNING WATCHING SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON AND AS HE SAID GETTING VERY WET BUT BEING VERY HAPPY
STRUGGLING TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY OF EIGHT WITH NO JOB AND NO INCOME HOW WAS HE TO FEED THEM SO HE TURNED TO THE ONLY TWO THINGS HE FELT HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE SITUATION AN ERODING SEVEN ACRE PARCEL OF LAND AND THE BIBLE
JUST ON OUR HARVESTED RAINWATER AND GREY WATER WE DON'T
BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE WE DRAIN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT RIGHT OUT OF THE SYSTEM SO LET'S LOOK AT THAT
SPREADING OUT THAT FLOW ALLOWING SEDIMENT TO DROP OUT MOISTURE TO LINGER SEEDS TO
OF RAIN STARTED TO CATCH ON
BECAUSE PEOPLE SAW THAT THERE WERE OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHOSE WELLS WENT DRY WHEN THEY WEREN'T PLANTING THE RAIN
WHY THE DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE IS THOSE
WHOSE WELLS WERE DRYING JUST KEPT TAKING WATER BUT NEVER GAVE BACK WHEREAS THE PHIRIS MADE SURE THEY KEPT PUTTING MORE BACK INTO THE
AND THE SHADE FROM THE TREES DROPS SUMMER TEMPERATURES BY TEN DEGREES
DROPPING THE COOLING COST OF ADJOINING HOMES AS WELL
AND IT'S CAUGHT ON AT SUCH A DEGREE WITH MANY MORE NEIGHBORS DOING THIS THAT WE NOW HAVE MANY PEOPLE WALKING AND BICYCLING THROUGH WHICH HAS DROPPED CRIME
BECAUSE NOW THERE'S MORE FRIENDLY EYES ON THE STREET
AND WITHIN THE STREET WE NOTICED THAT THE STREET GUTTER WOULD FLOW LIKE A CREEK IN A BIG RAIN
THEN HE COULD ACCESS THE WATER FROM THE TANK OF THE SOIL THROUGH
WAS PREVIOUSLY A BARREN DRAIN SO THE CREATION OF SUCH LIVING
WAS A CHALLENGE THAT COULD BE MET
BECAUSE I'D SEEN IT IN THE EXAMPLE THE PHIRIS LIVED AND THOSE THAT THEY HAD INSPIRED
I JUST HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TWEAK THINGS TO FIT THE UNIQUE CONDITIONS AND CONTEXT OF MY HOME
SO I RETURNED HOME TO
WHEN WE GOT MECHANICAL PUMPS THAT COULD MOVE WATER UPHILL SO I WAS PRETTY MUCH UNAWARE OF THE POTENTIAL OF HARVESTING RAINWATER UNTIL I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL TO AFRICA AND VISIT FAMILY AND THEN EXPLORE ON MY OWN
WE CAN AND NEED TO HARVEST TENS OF MILLIONS OF GALLONS MORE JUST IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND BILLIONS OF GALLONS MORE THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY
AND THE DEATH OF THE COLORADO RIVER'S DOWNSTREAM STRETCH
I HATE THIS STORY
BECAUSE
IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO TUCSON I SEE IT ALMOST EVERYWHERE
WE SQUANDER THE NATURAL ABUNDANCE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AND WE SPEND VAST AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES TRYING TO REPLACE THAT WHICH WE SQUANDERED BY TAKING IT FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER PLACES
WORSENING SCARCITY FOR EVERYONE
THAT EXCEEDS WHAT WE CAN HOLD AND INFILTRATE AND EVEN THAT OVERFLOW WATER IS USED AS RESOURCE BECAUSE WE DIRECT THAT TO MULTIPLE DOWNSTREAM STRATEGIES SO IN
OF ALL THE IMAGINARY PEOPLE PLEASE HELP ME AND THEN BUT DON'T WORRY NO ONE WAS HURT BECAUSE AT JUST THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE THEIR PART OF THE CRUMBLING CITY FELL INTO THE CHURNING
AND LAW BECAUSE WITHOUT A WILL THERE IS NO WAY
SO TO FURTHER SPARK THAT WILL I WROTE AND PUBLISHED HOW TO BOOKS DID COUNTLESS TALKS AND WITH OTHERS DID WORKSHOPS AND WE ORGANIZED ANNUAL RAIN AND TREE PLANTING PROJECTS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND OTHERS
AND BY DOING THIS THOUGH IT WAS MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE AND HE COULD MOVE ALL THE WATER WITH THE FREE POWER OF GRAVITY NO PUMPS NEEDED
FROM A SCARCITY MINDSET TO ABUNDANCE IT'S ABOUT USING WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE NOT WHAT YOU BUY OR IMPORT IT'S ABOUT PARTNERING WITH NATURAL SYSTEMS NOT FIGHTING THEM
IN THE RAIN THAT HAS NEVER LEFT ME IT CONTINUES TO SPARK MY WORK AND PLAY TO THIS DAY
SO HERE IN THE DESERT COMMUNITY OF TUCSON ARIZONA WE ONLY GET 11 INCHES OF RAIN A YEAR
YET MORE RAIN FALLS ON THE SURFACE AREA OF TUCSON ANY YEAR THAN ALL OF TUCSON AND ALL ITS INHABITANTS CONSUME OF MUNICIPAL WATER IN A YEAR DO
FROM THE HOUSE THIS ENABLED US TO BREAK A NEEDLESS ADDICTION UBIQUITOUS ACROSS THE US SO IT TURNS OUT THE AVERAGE SINGLE FAMILY HOUSEHOLD IN THE US
WATERS AND I WANTED TO LEAVE AND ASKED HIM FOR HIS ADVICE
TO WHICH POINT HE SLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND HE SAID WELL
YOU CANNOT LEAVE
BECAUSE IF YOU RUN FROM YOUR PROBLEMS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PLANT AND GROW PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE YOU GO
SO
CORRIDOR OF NATIVE FOOD TREES AND OTHER LIFE IRRIGATED WITH NOTHING MORE THAN THE RAIN FALLING ON THE STREET
CONTROLLING FLOODING AT THE SAME TIME
SO WE WENT TO THE CITY TO LEGALIZE AND ENHANCE THE PRACTICE
AND THEN WE GOT IT INCENTIVIZED
AND NOW IT'S EVEN MANDATED IN NEW CITY ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION
AND HOW DID WE BEGIN WELL THE SAME AS THE PHIRIS WITH OBSERVATION SO IN THE FIRST BIG RAIN WE ARE OUT THERE RUNNING AND WATCHING SEEING
MYSELF ON HOW TO HARVEST THE RAIN OR AS HE
AND I WAITED AND WAITED BUT EVENTUALLY THE STORM CLOUDS BUILT AND THEN WHEN THE RAINS CAME THE FLOODS WERE EPIC I MEAN THERE WAS A
BY THIS THOUGHT OF CONNECTING
KIDS AND KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST DONE IT WITH ADULTS AT THIS POINT THE FIRST THING WE DID IN OUR ORGANIZATION WITH KIDS IS TO START TED ED IT'S ED TED COM
WE PAIR UP EDUCATORS WITH ANIMATORS TO CREATE LESSONS AND TEACHERS AND ANYBODY CAN CREATE LESSONS USING TED ED SPECIAL TOOL
WE TRY TO DO A LOT LIKE WE DID HERE YESTERDAY WE BRING A LOT OF KIDS UP ON
TO NEW YORK THIS YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE ON NOVEMBER 15TH AND THERE IS GOING TO BE A LIVE STREAM AND HOPEFULLY YOU ALL WILL SHARE IT WITH YOUR KIDS YOUR FAMILIES BUT THE TALKS ARE YOU KNOW TED TALKS AND THEY ARE FOR ALL OF US TOO WE'LL BRING TOGETHER 500 KIDS AT THE BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF
WITH KIDS THE INCREDIBLE THING IS THAT HEARING THESE THINGS CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES THIS IS A QUOTE THE TEDXKIDS SMU TEAM HAS RECEIVED
IT'S KIND OF THE CORNERSTONE EVENT OF WHAT'S ALSO TEDX YOUTH DAY
SO WHILE THERE ARE TEDX EVENTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE HAPPENING
ALL THE TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON THIS DAY MANY PEOPLE ABOUT 100 GROUPS ORGANIZE AROUND THE WORLD TO DO TEDX EVENTS FOR KIDS SOME OF
ALREADY OR WHO WATCH A TED ED TALK AND START TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS BIGGER QUESTIONS
OR IF KIDS CAN REALIZE THEY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
THEN
HOW CAN WE NOT CONTINUE DOING THIS WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO DALLAS AND
TO KNOW THAT I WILL FOREVER CHERISH THAT MOMENT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF ME CHANGING THE WORLD
HE CAME UP WALKED IN THAT DAY HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO INTRODUCE A SPEAKER HE DID AND IT CHANGED HIM IN WAY AND HE GOT SO EXCITED AND IF MORE KIDS
JUST A FEW MORE EVEN CAN REALLY LEARN TO LOVE LEARNING
BY KIDS SOME OF THEM HAVE KIDS ON THE STAGE ALL OF THEM HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE IN FACT MY DAUGHTER WHO YOU MET EARLIER SHE IS 11 AND IN THE 6TH GRADE AND SHE'S ABOUT TO ORGANIZE ALSO IN NOVEMBER
HER 4TH TEDX EVENT EVER SHE'S BEEN DOING IT SINCE THIRD GRADE SO WE ARE REALLY
THAT HAVE 13 DIFFERENT SUGGESTED LESSONS THAT HELP YOUNG PEOPLE WITH PUBLIC SPEAKING AND AT THE END OF THE 13 LESSON PROGRAM THEY GIVE A TALK AND RECORD IT WITH THEIR OWN IDEA WORTH SPREADING AND THAT JUST LAUNCHED REALLY OFFICIALLY IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AND THERE ARE ALREADY 12 OF THOSE TED ED CLUBS HERE IN DALLAS WHICH IS REALLY AN EXCITING THING TO SEE
THEM TO THEIR STUDENTS OR THEIR KIDS TO DO AT HOME THEY ARE SHORT ANIMATIONS ON
{NS} SIX YEARS AGO WE DID THE FIRST EVER TEDXKIDS SMU HERE RIVES AND I WERE INVITED TO COME AND HOST I WAS SO EXCITED BECAUSE I WENT TO SMU I GREW UP IN DALLAS MY PARENTS ARE ON THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE
ABOUT THAT AND I'M PROUD OF HER
BUT THE THING IS TOO THAT IT KIND OF GOES BACK TO THE IMPACT THAT WE MAKE ON THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THAT SHARING IDEAS MAKES ON KIDS AND IT'S SO FUN TO WATCH THIS GROW AS A MOVEMENT AND THINK ABOUT HOW THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS RIGHT HERE IN DALLAS NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A QUOTE BY THIS KID GEORGE NUNEZ
REALLY SAW SOMETHING AMAZING ON HIS FACE I KNEW IN THAT MOMENT HE
WAS CHANGED BY HAVING HEARD HER TALK HE THEN TOLD ME HE WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT AND
I THOUGHT IT WAS SO INCREDIBLE IT MADE ME REALLY THINK ABOUT THE POWER THAT SHARING KNOWLEDGE AND SHARING IDEAS HAS ON YOUNG PEOPLE
AS ADULTS IT'S GREAT TOO IT'S GREAT FOR US TO SIT AND LISTEN TO INCREDIBLE PEOPLE DOING INCREDIBLE WORK MANY OF US WILL WALK OUT OF HERE THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT OR MAYBE HAVING A DIFFERENT LENS ON AN IDEA
THE TEAM AT SMU HEATHER AND CHRISTIE WE'VE GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH TED YOUTH AS WELL SO TED YOUTH IS ONCE A YEAR EVENT THAT WE'VE HELD IN BOTH NEW YORK WE DID THE LAST ONE IN NEW ORLEANS WE'LL
COMPLETELY REGRETTING NOT GETTING MORE INVOLVED SO DURING THE BREAK I DECIDED TO MEET AS MANY KIDS AS POSSIBLE I MET THIS
WHY WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH HATE WHY INTOLERANCE DEFEATS COMPASSION WHY WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT EACH OTHER
AND I AM CRYING
AND AM LISTENING TO THE SONG
AND
EVERY NEW VERSION
HAS A DEEP
HEALING EFFECT ON ME
EVERY SHARE
EVERY REACTION
EVERY CONTRIBUTION
RECONCILES ME WITH THE WHOLE WORLD
AND TODAY
MY TEARS FILL UP WITH LIGHT
WITH LOVE
EVEN WITH JOY
SO TODAY
8 MONTHS
AND 57 TRANSLATIONS FURTHER
MY VOICE TRAVELS EVERYWHERE
REALIZING MY DREAM
OF SETTING FOOT ON ALL CONTINENTS
WITH MY POEMS
MAKING THEM ACCESSIBLE IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN MY USUAL ENGLISH FRENCH AND DUTCH
WE ARE TOUCHED BY THE RIPPLES OF LOVE WE CONTRIBUTE PEACE TO THE WORLD ONE POEM ONE ACTION ONE LANGUAGE AT A TIME
THE POEM
NOW THIS IS
THE THIRD MORNING
AFTER THE ATTACKS
AND WE RECEIVE CONFIRMATION THAT
MY FRIEND JOHAN WAS KILLED
IN THE BLAST
WOUNDED NOT JUST MY LITTLE PIECE OF LAND
IS WHO I AM I SEEK RESONANCE THROUGH WORDS WHEN THIS
ON TUESDAY MARCH 22ND
2016 A
BOMB EXPLODES IN THE BRUSSELS METRO STATION
AND A FRIEND
JOHAN GOES MISSING
WE HAVE JUST BEEN HIT BY THE RIPPLES OF BLIND VIOLENCE
ON SOCIAL MEDIA
IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS
AND THEN ILARIA SENDS ME HER ITALIAN TRANSLATION OF THE POEM
SHE SAYS BECAUSE SHE NEEDS TO HEAR IT IN HER MOTHER TONGUE
AND SHE REQUESTS MY PERMISSION
TO ASK AND TO INVITE AS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS
AND AS MANY ARTISTIC INTERPRETATIONS AS POSSIBLE
I AM HUMBLED
AND GRATEFUL TO SUPPORT
THE POEM AND ITS MESSAGE
THAT NIGHT
I RECEIVE
THE CHINESE VERSION
I SHALL STAND FOR LOVE FOR WE NEED MORE LIGHT
NOT MORE DEATH
NOT MORE POWER
NOT MORE BOMBS
I SHALL STAND FOR LOVE SO THAT OUR CHILDREN MAY BE SAFE
OUR FRIENDS SHELTERED
WHAT TO SAY
WHAT TO DO
HOW CAN WE DEFEAT VIOLENCE
HOW CAN WE MAKE SENSE OF ALL THAT
HOW WOULD YOU EXPRESS THOSE FEELINGS
MY WAY IS TO WRITE POETRY
SO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING I MUST WRITE
AND I SHARE THE POEM
WITH MY GRIEVING FRIENDS
IT RESONATES WITH THEM
SO THEY ASK ME TO PUT IT ONLINE
AND BY
HOLD OURSELVES TO THESE UNREALISTIC STANDARDS OF PERFECTION AND THEN WE JUDGE OURSELVES WHEN WE DON'T LIVE UP TO THEM THE THING IS WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECT PERFECTION ISN'T POSSIBLE BUT
I DIDN'T SPEAK ANY THAI
BUT I UNDERSTOOD MINDFULNESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH PAYING ATTENTION
IN THE PRESENT MOMENT
MY ONLY INSTRUCTION WAS TO FEEL THE BREATH GOING IN AND OUT OF MY NOSE
SO I BEGAN
ONE BREATH
TWO BREATHS MY MIND WANDERED OFF
I BROUGHT IT BACK
ONE BREATH
TWO BREATHS IT WANDERED AGAIN SUCKED INTO THE PAST OR
LOST IN THE FUTURE AND NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED I JUST COULDN'T STAY PRESENT
THIS WAS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I THOUGHT MEDITATION WAS SUPPOSED TO FEEL
ALL THREE PARTS WORKING TOGETHER SYNERGISTICALLY PUT SIMPLY MINDFULNESS IS INTENTIONALLY
BRAIN WE CAN ACTUALLY SCULPT AND STRENGTHEN OUR SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS BASED ON REPEATED PRACTICE
TO JUST BE PRESENT
BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED MY MIND KEPT WANDERING OFF
AND AT THIS POINT I REALLY STARTED TO JUDGE MYSELF
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT THIS WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE YOU'RE A FAKE
AND THEN NOT ONLY WAS I JUDGING MYSELF I STARTED JUDGING EVERYONE
EVEN THE MONKS
WHY ARE THEY JUST SITTING HERE SHOULDN'T THEY BE DOING SOMETHING
THANKFULLY A MONK FROM LONDON ARRIVED WHO SPOKE ENGLISH AND AS I SHARED WITH HIM MY STRUGGLES HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID
OH DEAR
YOU'RE NOT PRACTICING MINDFULNESS
YOU'RE PRACTICING JUDGMENT IMPATIENCE FRUSTRATION
AND THEN HE SAID FIVE WORDS THAT HAVE NEVER LEFT
ISN'T JUST ABOUT ATTENTION
IT'S ABOUT KIND ATTENTION
THIS ATTITUDE OF KINDNESS WASN'T JUST A FOOTNOTE OR SOMETHING NICE TO HAVE
IT WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE PRACTICE
A PART OF MINDFULNESS THAT'S SO OFTEN OVERLOOKED
IN A HOSPITAL BED UNABLE TO WALK
DURING THE MANY MONTHS OF REHABILITATION I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIVE IN THIS BODY THAT COULD NO LONGER DO WHAT IT USED TO
THE PHYSICAL PAIN WAS DIFFICULT BUT WORSE WAS THE FEAR AND THE LONELINESS
AND I SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO COPE
SO I BEGAN SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP
AND EVENTUALLY THIS SEARCH LED ME
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FAMOUS STUDY OF LONDON TAXI DRIVERS
THE VISUAL SPATIAL MAPPING PART OF THE BRAIN IS BIGGER STRONGER
THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICING NAVIGATING THE 25000 STREETS OF LONDON ALL DAY LONG
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BRAINS OF MEDITATORS THE AREAS RELATED TO ATTENTION
LEARNING
COMPASSION GROW BIGGER AND STRONGER
IT'S
KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE SHAME IS UNIVERSAL ALL OF US FEEL IT AND WORSE WE HAVE THIS MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT IF WE SHAME OURSELVES IF WE BEAT OURSELVES UP WE'LL SOMEHOW IMPROVE AND YET
FOR ALL OF US NO MATTER WHAT
AND IT REQUIRES KIND ATTENTION
NOT SHAME
AND THIS KIND ATTENTION TAKES PRACTICE
IT TAKES LOTS OF PRACTICE
I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A SIMPLE PRACTICE THAT CONTINUES TO HELP ME
SOME YEARS AGO I WAS GOING THROUGH A DIFFICULT DIVORCE
AND I'D WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH THIS PIT OF SHAME IN MY STOMACH
MY MEDITATION TEACHER SUGGESTED AN EXPLICIT PRACTICE OF KIND ATTENTION
SHE SAID HOW ABOUT SAYING I LOVE YOU SHAUNA' EVERY DAY
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF NO WAY IT FELT SO CONTRIVED
SHE SAW MY HESITATION AND SUGGESTED HOW ABOUT TO JUST SAYING GOOD MORNING SHAUNA
OH AND TRY PUTTING YOUR HAND ON YOUR HEART WHEN YOU SAY IT IT RELEASES OXYTOCIN IT'S GOOD FOR YOU YOU KNOW
SHE KNEW THE SCIENCE WOULD WIN ME OVER SO THE NEXT DAY I PUT MY HAND ON MY HEART I TOOK A BREATH AND SAID
GOOD MORNING SHAUNA AND
IT WAS KIND OF NICE
I CONTINUED TO PRACTICE AND
A MONTH LATER WHEN I SAW HER I ADMITTED HOW HELPFUL IT HAD BEEN
WONDERFUL YOU'VE GRADUATED SHE SAID
NOW
THE ADVANCED PRACTICE
GOOD MORNING I LOVE YOU SHAUNA
SO THE NEXT DAY I
PUT MY HAND ON MY HEART ANCHORED MYSELF AND SAID
GOOD MORNING I LOVE YOU SHAUNA I
FELT NOTHING EXCEPT MAYBE A LITTLE RIDICULOUS BUT DEFINITELY NOT LOVE
BUT I KEPT PRACTICING BECAUSE
AS WE KNOW
WHAT WE PRACTICE GROWS STRONGER
AND THEN ONE DAY I PUT MY HAND ON MY HEART TOOK A BREATH
GOOD MORNING
I LOVE YOU SHAUNA
AND I FELT IT
I FELT MY GRANDMOTHER'S LOVE
FELT MY MOTHER'S LOVE I FELT MY OWN SELF LOVE
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT EVERY DAY SINCE THEN HAS BEEN THIS BUBBLE OF SELF LOVE AND I'VE NEVER FELT SHAME OR JUDGMENT AGAIN AND THAT'S NOT TRUE
BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS THIS PATHWAY OF KIND ATTENTION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
AND IT'S GROWING STRONGER EVERY DAY
SO I WANT TO INVITE YOU TOMORROW
TO PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR HEART
AND SAY GOOD MORNING
AND IF YOU'RE REALLY BRAVE
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STUDIES SHOWING THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS
IT'S GOOD FOR US
THE SECOND THING WE LEARNED WAS QUITE UNEXPECTED
ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE WE WERE WORKING WITH REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE THEIR GENDER THEIR BACKGROUND
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING
HE HELPED ME UNDERSTAND THAT MINDFULNESS ISN'T JUST ABOUT PAYING ATTENTION
IT'S ABOUT HOW WE PAY ATTENTION
WITH KINDNESS
HE SAID IT'S LIKE THESE LOVING ARMS THAT WELCOME EVERYTHING
EVEN THE MESSY IMPERFECT PARTS OF OURSELVES
HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT WE'RE PRACTICING ALL THE TIME
MOMENT BY MOMENT NOT JUST WHEN WE'RE MEDITATING BUT IN EVERY MOMENT
WE'RE
{NS} TO FLOOD OUR SYSTEM SHUTTING DOWN THE LEARNING CENTERS AND SHUTTLING OUR RESOURCES TO SURVIVAL PATHWAYS
THAT WE'RE MISSING THAT WE'RE NOT HERE SO PART OF MINDFULNESS IS SIMPLY LEARNING TO TRAIN THE MIND IN HOW TO BE HERE WHERE WE ALREADY ARE LIKE
IN FACT CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF I'VE BEEN SPEAKING FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES HAVE YOU NOTICED YOUR MIND HAS WANDERED ALL OF OUR MINDS WANDER RESEARCH FROM HARVARD SHOWS THE MIND WANDERS ON AVERAGE
OUR SOLDIERS CARRY SO MUCH PAIN AND SHAME
SO THE INTENTION OF THE MINDFULNESS GROUP WAS TO CULTIVATE THIS KIND ATTENTION
EVEN FOR THE SEEMINGLY UNFORGIVABLE PARTS OF OURSELVES
THERE WAS ONE MAN IN THE GROUP WHO NEVER SAID A WORD NEVER LOOKED UP
TWO MONTHS PASSED HE SEEMED UNREACHABLE
AND THEN ONE DAY HE RAISED HIS HAND AND HE SAID
I DON'T WANT TO GET BETTER
WHAT I SAW IN THE WAR WHAT I DID
I DON'T DESERVE TO GET BETTER
HE THEN LOOKED DOWN AT THE FLOOR AND PROCEEDED TO TELL US IN GREAT DETAIL
WHAT HE HAD SEEN
AND WHAT HE HAD DONE
AND I CAN STILL FEEL THE HORROR OF WHAT HE SHARED
AND HOW HIS SHAME FILLED THE ROOM
I LOOKED UP TO SEE HOW THE OTHER MEN WERE RESPONDING
AND THERE WAS NO JUDGMENT
ONLY COMPASSION ON THEIR FACES
I INVITED HIM TO LOOK UP AND TO WITNESS
THIS COMPASSION AND THIS KINDNESS
AS HE SLOWLY LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM
HIS FACE BEGAN TO SOFTEN
AND IN HIS EYES THERE WAS HOPE
THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE WASN'T JUST HIS PAST ACTIONS
THAT HE COULD CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY NOW
THAT HE COULD CHANGE
THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I'VE LEARNED IT'S
IF IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC YOU CAN REMAIN PERFECTLY CALM
IF YOU CAN SEE YOUR NEIGHBORS TRAVEL TO FANTASTIC PLACES WITHOUT A TWINGE OF JEALOUSY
IF YOU CAN LOVE EVERYONE AROUND YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY
AND IF YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND CONTENTMENT JUST WHERE YOU ARE
THEN YOU'RE
DO YOU WANT TO PRACTICE
WHEN I LEFT THAILAND I WANTED TO KEEP PRACTICING MINDFULNESS
AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND IT SCIENTIFICALLY
SO I BEGAN A PHD PROGRAM EVENTUALLY BECAME A PROFESSOR
AND I'VE SPENT THE PAST 20 YEARS INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF POPULATIONS INCLUDING VETERANS WITH PTSD PATIENTS WITH INSOMNIA WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER STRESSED OUT COLLEGE STUDENTS HIGH LEVEL BUSINESS EXECUTIVES
AND OVER AND OVER THE DATA SHOWED TWO KEY THINGS
FIRST
OWN JOURNEY INTO MINDFULNESS WAS UNEXPECTED WHEN I WAS 17 I
KINDNESS GIVES US THE COURAGE TO LOOK AT THOSE PARTS OF OURSELVES WE DON'T WANT TO SEE
AND SECOND
KINDNESS BATHES US WITH DOPAMINE
TURNING ON THE LEARNING CENTERS OF THE BRAIN AND GIVING US THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO CHANGE
TRUE AND LASTING TRANSFORMATION
THE CENTERS OF THE BRAIN THAT HAVE TO DO WITH GROWTH AND LEARNING SHUT DOWN
THAT MOST NEED OUR ATTENTION IT'S JUST TOO PAINFUL TO LOOK AT THEM SO WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE
FEET
ON THE FLOOR
WIGGLE YOUR TOES
AND SENSE YOUR WHOLE BODY SITTING HERE
SOFTENING THE FACE
SOFTENING THE JAW
AND NOTICE THAT YOU'RE BREATHING
FEELING THE BREATH AS IT NATURALLY FLOWS IN AND OUT OF THE BODY
JUST BEING
AS A PROFESSOR AND SCIENTIST I STUDY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE HOW PEOPLE TRANSFORM AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE VEHICLES I'VE FOUND IS
BUT THAT'S A FUNNY WORD TO DEFINE TOO RIGHT CLICH
BECAUSE ONE MAN'S CLICH IS
ANOTHER MAN'S EPIPHANY
THE SAME WAY THAT ONE MAN'S FLOWER IS ANOTHER MAN'S WEED
AND BOTH
JUST LIKE POETS HAVE BEEN POPPING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE SINCE THE
I LIKE TO IMAGINE THOUSANDS OF BRIGHT CHEEKED CHILDREN BLOWING DANDELION SEEDS ONTO PERFECTLY MANICURED LAWNS LEAVING BEHIND A RIOT OF YELLOW PRICKLY REMINDERS OF HOW UNIMPORTANT ALL OF OUR DEFINITIONS ACTUALLY ARE
OF COURSE I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT A POET STANDING AROUND TALKING ABOUT FLOWERS IS ABOUT AS CLICH AS SAYING THAT GOD IS BRONCOS FAN BECAUSE SUNSETS ARE ORANGE
I'M SORRY WHEN WE SAY THOSE THINGS THEY BECOME EXPERIMENTS WE RELINQUISH CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENS THEREAFTER
REACHING ACCORD WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IN FAVOR OF STRONGER TIES WITH RUSSIA IN
BEFORE I STOPPED WOMEN AS THEY APPROACHED THE BARRICADES TO LAY THEIR
THE FOLLOWING DAY PRESIDENT YANUKOVYCH FLED UKRAINE IN ALL THREE MONTHS OF PROTESTS RESULTED IN MORE THAN 120 CONFIRMED DEAD AND MANY MORE MISSING
TODAY THE DEATH TOLL STANDS AROUND 3000 WHILE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED
I WAS IN UKRAINE AGAIN SIX WEEKS AGO IN MAIDAN THE BARRICADES HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED
AND THE PAVING STONES WHICH WERE USED AS WEAPONS DURING THE PROTESTS REPLACED SO THAT TRAFFIC FLOWS FREELY THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE SQUARE
WE ARE NOT THE WAY WE LOOK BUT THE WAY WE ARE THEY SPEAK ABOUT DIFFERENT GENDER ROLES IN CONFLICT NOT ONLY IN MAIDAN AND NOT ONLY IN UKRAINE
{NS} WHEN I ARRIVED IN KIEV ON FEBRUARY 1 THIS YEAR INDEPENDENCE SQUARE WAS UNDER SIEGE SURROUNDED BY POLICE LOYAL TO THE
FELT THAT I NEEDED TO REMOVE THE DRAMATIC VISUALS THAT HAD BECOME SO FAMILIAR AND
THE LANGUAGE BUT RATHER ON A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF
MY BEDROOM DOOR I WAS LIKE ROSS GELLER YOU KNOW THEY GUY FROM FRIENDS HE USED TO CORRECT WHO' TO
IN THAT LANGUAGE IN THAT DIALECT OF LONDON IS NOW CONSIDERED NOT TO BE CORRECT GRAMMATICALLY
THE VERY FIRST DAYS THERE IN THE UK I MADE A DAUNTING REALISATION
I WAS NO LONGER THE EXPERT
IN THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN AROUND ME
IT WAS ENGLISH NOW NOT GOOD OLD GREEK
AND I WOULD MAKE ACTUAL MISTAKES THERE I WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE I LIKE SHEEPS MORE THAN GOATS
NOT TO MENTION
PRONOUNCING BOTH CHEAP' AND CHIP'
THE SAME
PEOPLE WERE SENSITIVE TO NEITHER
OK
I WAS INDEED AN INTROVERT
AND I DON'T AGREE I WASN'T AGREEABLE
BUT
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ME BEING A GRAMMAR NAZI
WELL SPEAKING IN PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS
AN INTROVERT IS NOT JUST A SHY PERSON
THE DEFINITION OF AN INTROVERT IS
HAPPENS
GET OVER IT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CANNOT GET OVER 18TH CENTURY LANGUAGE PURISTS ARE STUCK THERE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN LANGUAGE WAS STANDARDISED THEY STANDARDISED THE DIALECT OF THE HIGH SOCIETY IN LONDON AND THEY FORMED A CODIFIED FORMAL REGISTER OF THE LANGUAGE FOR THE
IN MY RECKLESS YOUTH I USED TO BE A LANGUAGE PEDANT I WOULD DRIVE MY FRIENDS NUTS WITH MY LINGUISTIC
A NON NATIVE SPEAKER OF ENGLISH PUT THE
WHO TO WHOM'
ISSUE INTO PERSPECTIVE
BECAUSE NATIVE SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH WERE INCAPABLE OF MAKING MY MISTAKES
BUT THEY ALL MADE THAT WHOM' MISTAKE
SO IS THAT REALLY A MISTAKE
WELL THE ANSWER TO THAT
CAME FROM MY STUDIES IN LINGUISTICS WHERE I FOUND
OUT THAT NEUROLINGUISTS ARE ABLE TO DETECT BRAIN ACTIVITY WHEN YOU HEAR A LINGUISTIC MISTAKE
IT'S LIKE AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT HITTING YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU
MEAN I KNOW MY LATIN AND I KNOW THAT ENGLISH DOES NOT DERIVE FROM LATIN SO WHY WOULD PEOPLE INSIST ON USING THE RULES OF A DEAD LANGUAGE TO JUDGE A LIVING ONE
AND THEN IT HIT ME
I HAD BEEN DOING THE SAME THING WITH GREEK
I HAD BEEN JUDGING MODERN GREEK BASED ON GRAMMATICAL RULES FROM TWO AND A HALF MILLENNIA AGO
THE SAME THING
ENGLISH PURISTS DID WITH LATIN BECAUSE LATIN WAS THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCIENCES FOR CENTURIES IT WAS
THE NORM OF THE LANGUAGE IS ITS USAGE IT'S NOT A DIVINE AUTHORITY
SO
DO RESPECT AND CHERISH
VARIETY WITHIN YOUR LANGUAGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR LANGUAGE
VIBRANT
FLEXIBLE
RICH AND ULTIMATELY ALIVE
THANK YOU
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SPLIT THE INFINITIVES' IN ENGLISH AND THAT WAS
LIKE THAT PRONOUN SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE NOMINATIVE CASE NO IT'S LIKE HOW YOUR BODY REACTS TO SOMETHING TO WHICH YOU ARE ALLERGIC
IT'S JUST AN INSTANT REACTION SO LET'S TRY A COUPLE OF SENTENCES TOGETHER IF I TELL YOU LET'S
WENT'
SUDDENLY YOU ALL KNOW IT'S A MISTAKE
HOW LANGUAGE PURISTS ARE STUCK IN THE PAST I MEAN WITH LATIN AND ALL WHY ARE THEY STUCK THERE
DOING SOMETHING WRONG I COULDN'T HAVE EXPLAINED IT BACK THEN BUT NOW SEVERAL
MY FRIENDS' USAGE OF MODERN GREEK BASED ON RULES OF ANCIENT GREEK BECAUSE YOU SEE I STUDIED CLASSICS THAT IS ANCIENT GREEK AND LATIN
SO
AFTER GRADUATING
WITH A BA IN CLASSICS AND BEING
DOUBLE NEGATIVES WHICH WERE NOT THE NORM IN THE DIALECT OF LONDON
LIKE
THE PHRASE I CANNOT GET NO SATISFACTION'
THAT PHRASE DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE STANDARDISED FORM OF THE LANGUAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PART OF THAT SELECTED DIALECT
AND
THIS IS THE
BIGGEST FALLACY OF THE LANGUAGE PEDANTS
THEIR BELIEF IS THAT
THEIR RULES APPLY TO THE WHOLE OF THE LANGUAGE
WHEN IN REALITY
THEIR RULES DESCRIBE OR BETTER PRESCRIBE
HOW LANGUAGE
SHOULD BE USED IN THE FORMAL REGISTER
SO THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FORMAL LANGUAGE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS NOT JUST THAT REGISTER IT'S THE SUM OF ALL ITS DIALECTS STANDARD AND NON STANDARD ONES AND ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS SPEAK AND ALL THAT
IT'S NOT JUST THAT REGISTER SO WHEN YOU CHOOSE
BETWEEN
WHO DID YOU SPEAK TO AND TO WHOM DID YOU SPEAK
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF GRAMMATICALITY AT ALL IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FORMALITY
IT'S MORE FORMAL
TO SAY TO WHOM' WHEN WE ARE SPEAKING FORMALLY
AND IT'S EXPECTED AND EVEN APPROPRIATE TO USE WHO' WHEN WE ARE SPEAKING INFORMALLY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PERCEIVED AS SNOB
SO THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST MISTAKE WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST MISTAKE
SIMPLY PUT IT'S THIS
IT'S YOUR BELIEF
THAT THE PEDANT'S STRICTURES ARE SCRIPTURES
YOU PERCEIVE GRAMMARS AND DICTIONARIES TO BE HOLY BOOKS
THE RULES OF WHICH THOU SHALT NOT
DISOBEY
OR ELSE YOU'LL BURN IN ETERNAL HELLFIRE
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT A LINGUISTIC MISTAKE' IS NOT A SIN
IT'S JUST A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT
DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR AND SEE THOSE BOOKS FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE THEY ARE JUST ATTEMPTS BY NOT SO DIVINE CREATURES TO DESCRIBE AND PRESCRIBE LANGUAGE THE FORMAL LANGUAGE
AND I AS A LINGUIST
BUT LITERALLY MAKE NO MISTAKE AROUND THEM
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THOSE GRAMMAR NAZIS ARE SUCH KNOW IT ALL SHOW OFFS
RIGHT
WELL I WILL ASK
DO THEY ACTUALLY KNOW IT ALL
I SHALL
SO WHY THINGS OUR BRAIN DOES NOT DETECT AS MISTAKES
JUDGED AS MISTAKES BY LANGUAGE PEDANTS WHERE IS THIS DISCREPANCY COMING FROM
WELL THE ANSWER TO THAT WAS MORE FAMILIAR TO ME THAN I THOUGHT
LATIN
LET ME EXPLAIN THAT BY GIVING AN EXAMPLE
IN LATIN THE WORD THE INFINITIVE VIDERE'
DYING TO FIND OUT BUT IN ORDER TO GAIN SELF AWARENESS YOU HAVE TO FIRST DISSECT THE PSYCHE OF THE GRAMMAR NAZI AND I THINK I'M ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THEM ALL TOO WELL
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
I HAVE
YOU ARE AND THE LANGUAGE PURISTS WOULD ASK WHY SHOULD WE SHIFT ALL THE
LANGUAGE WITH THE PERFECT GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE THE RULES OF WHICH ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAD TO
DON'T LIKE LANGUAGE CHANGE
BECAUSE THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH LANGUAGE CHANGE
SO THEY BELIEVE THAT CHANGE MAKES LANGUAGE CORRUPTED
AND SO IT'S NO LONGER PURE THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED PURISTS
SO IF LANGUAGE NOW IS CORRUPTED THEN WHEN WAS IT
PERFECT WHEN WAS THAT GOLDEN AGE
WAS IT 40 YEARS
SENSITIVE TO TYPOS AND GRAMMOS ARE MORE PROBABLY INTROVERTS THAN EXTROVERTS WHEN I SAY
SHOW HOW YOU NORMAL PEOPLE MAKE A CERTAIN HUGE LINGUISTIC MISTAKE AND DON'T KNOW
THAT IF YOU TOOK SLEDGEHAMMER TO HIM YOU WOULDN'T RAISE ANYTHING
EXCEPT MAYBE A HOWLERY VERB
THERE
IS A WONDERFUL OPERA CALLED MAHAGONNY
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE CITY MAHAGONNY
BY BRECHT AND WEILL THE SAME GUYS WHO DID THE THREEPENNY OPERA
THINK OF SOUL AND SPIRIT AS SOMETHING EVANESCENT ALMOST LIKE A VAPOUR
THAT VANISHES OFF NO THEY ARE AN EXPRESSION OF OUR VITALITY
SO THE HERB THYME
IS A GERMICIDAL DISINFECTANT IT IS MILD BUT BECAUSE OF THAT IT IS AN ASSISTANT TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IT KILLS GERMS
IT IS A MAJOR HERB OF FRENCH CUISINE
IT WAS GROWN IN PUBLIC PLACES IN THE ANCIENT WORLD
AND PEOPLE STEPPED ON IT TO RELEASE ITS AROMA
THEY BURNT IT ON ALTARS AND THEY HAD A CHORUS THAT DANCED AROUND THE ALTAR TO INHALE ITS FUMES MEDIEVAL MAIDENS
SEWED IT INTO THE GARMENTS OF KNIGHTS BECAUSE IT REPRESENTED COURAGE
AM GOING TO MAKE AN OINTMENT
FOR THE PURPOSE OF RUBBING ON YOUR THYMUS GLAND
I AM GOING TO CALL IT A THYME BOMB
SO I LEFT THE BEST
DEFINITION OF THYMOS FOR THE LAST
MY TEACHER TILLICH WROTE BOOK ABOUT IT
CALLED THE COURAGE TO BE
IT RESISTS TRANSLATION OF THE GREEK WORD THYMOS A BRILLIANT
TRANSLATION AND
HE TRACES THE HISTORY OF THE COURAGE TO BE THROUGH WESTERN PHILOSOPHY
A VITAL SELF AFFIRMATION
IT'S A COROLLARY OF THE COURAGE TO BE
THE CONFIDENCE
THE VITAL CONFIDENCE TO MEET ANY OBSTACLE
THERE ARE TWO COGNATES
FROM THYMOS
THE THYMUS GLAND
AND THYMUS VULGARIS THE HERB THYME
GOING THROUGH THE LATIN
THE THYMUS GLAND IS THE CENTRE OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND BOTH TERMS
FOR THE HERB AND THE GLAND BEAR OUT THE MEANING OF THE GREEK ROOT THYMOS
IT'S THE CENTRE OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM SO IT'S THE GLAND OF COURAGE
IT DEFENDS YOU AGAINST ILLNESS AND DISEASE
IT PROGRAMMES YOUR T CELLS YOUR THYMUS CELLS WHICH ARE THE FRONT LINE OF DEFENSE
IN A WAY THE THYMUS GLAND IS THE KIND OF PROTO BRAIN
IT HAS IMMUNE MEMORY
AND BEST OF ALL IT DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN SELF AND NOT SELF
SO IF YOU WANTED TO LOOK AT THE ROOT OF OUR SELF AFFIRMATION OF OUR SELF UNDERSTANDING IT WOULD BE THE THYMUS GLAND AND OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
WHICH IS BASED ON THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN SELF AND NOT SELF
THERE IS A FAIRLY RECENT SCIENCE CALLED PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY
WHICH ATTEMPTS TO TRACE THE PATHWAYS FROM THE BRAIN TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
AND IN CASES OF ENOURMOUS STRESS
THE BRAIN SECRETES CORTICAL STEROIDS CORTISOL
WHICH DIMINISHES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
AND SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT POST TRAUMATIC STRESS
SUFFERERS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER SUCH GREAT STRESS ALSO HAVE SUCH A DIMINISHED IMMUNE SYSTEM
AND SUICIDE IS A CONSEQUENCE THE STATISTICS ON SUICIDE THAT I HEARD IN THE REHEARSAL YESTERDAY
IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE
SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THEY SUFFERED IN
A SENSE OF DESTRUCTION
AN UNDERMINING OF THEIR SOUL
WHICH IS THIS
MIDDLE REALM
WHICH WE ARE SO
UNMINDFUL OF
COURAGE TO BE VITAL SELF AFFIRMATION THE BRIDGE BETWEEN REASON AND DESIRE OK THE UNREFLECTIVE STRIVING TOWARDS
IF YOU SAW THE WOLF OF WALL STREET
YOU SAW MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY DEMONSTRATING WHAT I CALL THE THYMUS THUMP
TO DICAPRIO
HE OVERDOES IT A BIT
HE DOESN'T REALLY REALIZE THAT IT'S A SPIRITUAL EXERCISE
AND A FORM OF THERAPY
AS I'M GOING TO
UNVEIL IT TO YOU THIS MORNING
HE JUST USES IT AS A WAY OF RAISING THE RESONANCE AND
VIBRATORY EFFECT OF HIS VOICE
AND IT'S COMPLETELY LOST ON DICAPRIO WHO WAS SO SPIRITUALLY VACUOUS
MEANS SOUL IT'S REALLY BASICALLY SOUL AND IT CAME INTO EXPRESSION IN WESTERN CULTURE WITH SOCRATES HE'S CREDITED WITH DISCOVERING THE HUMAN SOUL AND IT'S USUALLY THOUGHT OF AS RATIONAL SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
IT'S ABOUT MYTHICAL CITY IN FLORIDA IT'S REALLY A PARABLE OF THE LATE STAGE OF THE SELF DESTRUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY
THIS MYTHICAL CITY IS A MAGNET FOR PROSTITUTES AND PIMPS AND CRIMINALS AND GAMBLERS AND LOW LIFE
OH SHOW US THE WAY TO THE NEXT WHISKEY BAR
OH DON'T ASK WHY
I TELL YOU WE MUST DIE
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OPERA ONE OF THE CHARACTERS OUT
OF THE BLUE
GIVES VOICE TO THIS EXISTENTIAL LAMENT
BUT SOMETHING IS MISSING
AND WHAT'S MISSING
IS WHAT'S MISSING WITH DICAPRIO IN THE WOLF OF WALL STREET
IT'S THE SOUL
IT'S THIS CENTRE REALM THIS MIDDLE REALM
BETWEEN REASON AND DESIRE
MY TEACHER TILLICH
CHARACTERISED OUR HISTORICAL PERIOD
AS SUFFERING FROM THE ANXIETY OF MEANINGLESSNESS AND EMPTINESS
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT SUFFER A SENSE OF EMPTINESS OF LOSS
IN THIS REGION OF THEIR BODY AND OF THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS
THE GREEKS HAD A WORD FOR IT
THYM S'
T H Y M S WITH AN ACCENT OVER THE O
IT MEANS COURAGE VITALITY AND SPIRIT IN THE SENSE OF SPIRITED
WITH THE BODILY BASIS YOU KNOW IF YOU SAY SOMEBODY IS VERY SPIRITED THEY HAVE HIGH SPIRITS
WE OFTEN USE IT WITH REFERENCE TO HORSES
VERY SPIRITED HORSE
HARD WITH BLOOD TEARS AND SWEAT YOU'RE ASKING ME DO I GOT WHAT IT TAKES I'M TELLING YOU DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE SOME MISTAKES AND I'MMA GO
IS MY RESPONSE TO WHAT IS REALLY BEST FOR ME I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY ONLY RESPECT THAT IS THE BEST
I'VE WRITTEN CHICKA WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU ALREADY PROVEN TO CALL YOURSELF A QUALIFIED PERSON MAN
THAT IF PEOPLE BECOME MORE HELPFUL THERE'LL BE MUCH LESS SHIT ON THIS PLANET SO DO
GOT NO OTHER STANDARDS ARE YOU RELATED TO A ROYAL FAMILY LET ME BE IN IT
YOU GOT YOU SAID IT'S THE SAME AND YOU GOT IT WRONG YOU REMEMBER AND YOU LEARNED THE ANSWER
SUCCESSFUL PROJECT THE FAMILY ACTUALLY END UP IN MAKASSAR SOUTH
IS THE NEW SCALE WE KNOW THAT AND SO PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE THE WORLD IS NOW A TURBULENT PLACE HAVE YOU HEARD THEM SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT
AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF A GLOBAL CORPORATION IF YOU'RE CONNECTED TO THE
IS THAT POSSIBLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE VISIONS WE HAVE THE VISIONS OF
TO A DEMONSTRATION WHERE THEY BASICALLY THE DEMONSTRATOR DID SOMETHING
TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IF YOU WORK IN A MARKET WHERE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN
I KNOW YOU GUYS GREW UP IN THE DAYS WHEN THERE WERE ACTUALLY THESE THINGS CALLED CORRECT ANSWERS BECAUSE OF THE ANSWER YOU GAVE ME TO THE HORIZONTAL LINE PUZZLE AND YOU BELIEVE IT WILL LAST
HAPPENED IN THIS WORLD OF PIPE IS SOMEBODY HAS FLIPPED IT
ASK MYSELF WHY WAS IT EVER SMALL ISN'T IT WEIRD YOU
MY FRIEND AND MENTOR TIM BROWN OF IDEO HE EXPLAINS THAT
LEAVING MY DESK AND THE REASON I CAN DO THAT IS BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY TWO PEOPLE I LOOK LIKE ONE PERSON BUT I'M TWO
DIDN'T HAVE THAT GREEN INK YOU'D NEVER NOTICE AND I THINK THIS IS OUR
SO OBVIOUS TO US SO INSTEAD WE SPEND OUR TIME RESPONDING RATIONALLY TO A WORLD WHICH WE
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW A PROCEDURE TO AND IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING YOU'RE SLOPPY YOU GET IT WRONG HOW SHOULD YOU BE
NOTICED THAT CHANGE I DESCRIBED EARLIER WHAT WE DO
OR SOMETHING HAS CHANGED THE RULES ABOUT HOW OUR WORLD WORKS WHEN I'M JOKING I TRY AND EXPLAIN IT
OF DESTRUCTION IMAGES OF KILLING OF SECTARIAN
EVEN THE POWER OF DECEPTION THEY COULD NOT AND THEY
THEY ASKED THEIR PARENTS TO GO DOWN TO THE STREETS AND
TO GO DOWN TO THE STREETS AND TO RAISE THEIR VOICES THEY TRIED TO KILL THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WANTED TO ARREST
COVERING BUT WASHINGTON D C AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME FOR AL JAZEERA ENGLISH BUT I CAN TELL
AND THEN WHEN THEY FAILED THEY STARTED SPEAKING ABOUT CONSPIRACIES THAT EMERGED FROM TEL AVIV AND WASHINGTON IN ORDER
THIS KIND OF FEELING UNIVERSAL FEELING OF SUPPORTING THE WEAK AND THE OPPRESSED TO
AT THE MIDDLE OF IT BUT THIS IS A STORY IT
ARE MEETING AS WE SPEAK THEY'VE HAD SOME SPEAKERS THERE I BELIEVE THEY'VE HEARD YOUR
WK I THINK WE HAVE DISCOVERED A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THE ARAB WORLD THAT PEOPLE CARE
OF CREATING THE CHANGE THAN THE OLD INCLUDING
AUTHORITARIAN SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN INSTEAD OF HAVING THE SECOND
ENOUGH TO BALANCE THIS KIND OF IMAGINATION AND THE PROCESS LEADING TO IT NOT USING VIOLENCE
{NS} BEFORE WE THOUGHT AND GOVERNMENTS TOLD US AND EVEN
AFTER THE OTHER AL JAZEERA IS NOT A TOOL OF REVOLUTION
DO WE IMAGINE FUTURE WHICH IS MAGNIFICENT AND PEACEFUL AND TOLERANT
WHO HAVE AMBITION AND WHO HAVE LIBERATED THEMSELVES FROM THE FEELING OF INFERIORITY AND THEN WE TOOK THAT DECISION
CULTURAL DIVERSITY WITH OUR FAITH IN OUR TRADITION
AND EMPOWERED US TO GO DOWN TO THE STREETS NOTHING HAPPENED NO VIOLENCE NOTHING
OR SOMETHING MORE WADAH KHANFAR ACTUALLY THIS MAY BE THE BIGGEST STORY THAT WE HAVE EVER
HAS CREATED A NEW REALITY FOR US
OF ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD FIFTY PERCENT OF IT IS COMING FROM AMERICA
WE DISCOVERED THAT PEOPLE CARE AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THEY ARE RECEIVING THE STREAM THROUGH OUR INTERNET UNFORTUNATELY IN THE UNITED
FROM THEIR PEOPLE FROM THE MASSES AND NOW WE ARE SEEING THEM
WITH THE PEOPLE OF THAT REGION A GREAT FUTURE AND HOPE AND
YEARS AGO EXACTLY I WAS IN AFGHANISTAN I WAS COVERING THE WAR IN
THESE PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE WISER THAN NOT ONLY THE POLITICAL ELITE EVEN THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE EVEN OPPOSITION LEADERS
THAN THE IMAGES OF VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM LET US SUPPORT THESE PEOPLE
INTERNATIONALLY GLOBALLY THROUGH OUR ENGLISH CHANNEL AND THEN PEOPLE STARTED TO FEEL THAT
THAT ESPOUSES SOME OF THE VALUES YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT SO INSPIRINGLY WK AND
WHO HAVE ORGANIZED THEMSELVES IN CERTAIN GROUPS AND COUNCILS THEY ARE GUARDING THE
A NEW FUTURE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WE HAVE
CANNOT CREATE BUT TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION
HOW DID THE ELITE DEAL WITH THAT THE SO CALLED POLITICAL ELITE IN FRONT OF FACEBOOK THEY BROUGHT THE CAMELS IN TAHRIR
ON US AND PEOPLE REJECTED THAT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT IT IS ALIEN TO THEIR
SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THIS A STORY OF THE YEAR A STORY OF THE
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PHONE OUR CORRESPONDENTS THERE AND TO PHONE OUR NEWSROOM AND TO TELL THEM
SAME TIME ALSO TO MAKE IT REASONABLE AND TO
NOT CREATE REVOLUTIONS HOWEVER WHEN SOMETHING OF THAT
HISTORY BUT AT THE SAME TIME OPEN TO UNIVERSAL VALUES
WHAT HAPPENED IN TUNISIA OVER A FEW DAYS THE TUNISIAN REGIME
OLD AGED AUTHORITARIAN CORRUPT SITUATIONS REGIMES THAT WE HAVE SEEN AROUND
AND CHOOSE WHO WE WOULD LIKE TO RULE THEIR FUTURE THE FUTURE SHOULD BE RULED BY PEOPLE THEMSELVES
ON BROADWAY HE GOT THE BOOK TO BE A PLAY AND NOW 55 YEARS LATER THAT SAME FOUNDATION ASKED US TO CREATE A NEW VERSION OF THE PLAY
THAT IS IN THE INAUDIBLE AND THAT'S WHY WE BUILT THIS THEATER BECAUSE
IT'S HUGE
AND
THAT'S IMPORTANT AND I
WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT
TO
INVOLVE A NEW GENERATION WE STARTED A FOUNDATION THAT DOES EXACTLY THAT
A 1 1 SCALE A REPLICA OF HER LIVING
FIND A NEW AUDIENCE YOUNG AUDIENCE TO COME TO A THEATRICAL
AND WHEN THEY DO WE LEARN SOMETHING AMAZING THE THEATER IS AN IDEAL
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE THEATER THE LIVE THEATER IS AN IDEAL WAY TO COMMUNICATE THE IMPORTANT HISTORICAL CULTURAL MESSAGES TO NEW AUDIENCE
SO WE LOVE THIS WE LOVE THE FACT THAT WE CAN INVOLVE THIS NEW
COME HERE THEIR CELLPHONES GO OFF THE LIGHTS GO OFF
AND THEY'RE ALONE WITH THIS AMAZING STORY COMING ALIVE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES
AND IT HAS HUGE IMPACT ON THEM NOT ONLY
THE HISTORY THAT THEY THINK THEY KNOW OR HAVE HEARD ABOUT
BUT ALSO
AND PERFORMERS SO WHEN YOU THINK OF ANNE AS A PLAY YOU THINK OF SMALL ROOMS A SMALL PRODUCTION
TO DO THESE KINDS OF SUBJECT MATTERS AND BUILD A NEW
THIS THEATER CAME TOGETHER
WITH
ACTUALLY
THE REAL REASON BEING EDUCATION
OTTO FRANK STARTED A FOUNDATION
WHEN HE FOUND
THE TRANSCRIPTS OF HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS GOAL WAS TO EDUCATE A NEW GENERATION ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST THROUGH THE BOOK AND THE
THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH
AND
IT'S AMAZING HOW THEY REACT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY
REALLY STRIKES US WHEN WE TALK TO THEM IS THEY IMMEDIATELY PICK UP THE RELEVANCE OF THIS STORY
MATTER WHEN WE WERE ASKED TO DO THIS THE CONDITION WAS YOU CAN ONLY DO IT IN AMSTERDAM WHERE THE STORY ORIGINATED BUT
BECAUSE WE LOVE THIS PLAY AND I'M REALLY PROUD AND HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH US IN OUR THEATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIS IS WHERE SHE LIVED UNTIL THEY WENT INTO HIDING
TEXT FROM ANNE ANNE FRANK IT WAS NOT ONLY A GREAT HONOR BUT ALSO A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE A HUNDRED PEOPLE HUNCHED OVER A DESK WITH LITTLE DIALS AND THAT THAT CONTROL
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TECHNOLOGY WE TEND TO TALK ABOUT IT AS THIS BLUE SKY OPPORTUNITY IT COULD GO ANY DIRECTION AND I WANT TO GET SERIOUS FOR A MOMENT AND TELL YOU WHY IT'S GOING IN A VERY SPECIFIC DIRECTION
ONCE YOU START UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR MIND CAN BE SCHEDULED INTO HAVING LITTLE THOUGHTS OR LITTLE BLOCKS OF TIME THAT YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE
WOULDN'T WE WANT TO USE THAT UNDERSTANDING AND PROTECT AGAINST THE WAY THAT THAT HAPPENS
I THINK WE NEED TO SEE OURSELVES FUNDAMENTALLY IN A NEW WAY
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A NEW PERIOD OF HUMAN HISTORY LIKE THE ENLIGHTENMENT
BUT ALMOST A KIND OF SELF AWARE ENLIGHTENMENT THAT WE CAN BE PERSUADED
THAT'S SHRINKING ALL OF MY MARKET SHARE SO NOW I HAVE TO AUTOPLAY ALL THE VIDEOS IN THE NEWSFEED BEFORE WAITING FOR YOU TO CLICK PLAY
IS FIGURING OUT WHAT OUR BOUNDARIES WOULD BE YOU WOULD WANT YOUTUBE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SAY FALLING ASLEEP THE CEO OF NETFLIX RECENTLY
YOU LOOK AT THAT AND SAY WELL THAT'S SHRINKING MY MARKET SHARE SO I'M GOING TO AUTOPLAY THE NEXT EPISODE BUT THEN IF YOU'RE
IT'S AS IF ALL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY IS BASICALLY ONLY ASKING OUR LIZARD BRAIN WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO JUST IMPULSIVELY GET YOU TO DO THE NEXT TINIEST THING WITH YOUR TIME
INSTEAD OF ASKING YOU IN YOUR LIFE WHAT WE WOULD BE MOST TIME WELL SPENT FOR YOU WHAT WOULD BE THE PERFECT TIMELINE THAT MIGHT INCLUDE SOMETHING LATER WOULD BE TIME WELL SPENT FOR YOU HERE AT TED IN YOUR LAST DAY HERE CA
WE NEED TO MAKE THREE RADICAL CHANGES TO TECHNOLOGY AND TO OUR SOCIETY THE FIRST IS WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE PERSUADABLE
WOULD YOU LIKE US TO OPTIMIZE FOR YOUR REFLECTIVE BRAIN OR YOUR LIZARD BRAIN YOU CHOOSE TH RIGHT THAT WOULD BE
SOMETIMES THE WORLD'S MOST PRESSING
AND IMPORTANT PROBLEMS
ARE NOT THESE
HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE THINGS THAT WE COULD CREATE IN THE FUTURE
SOMETIMES THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS THE ONES THAT ARE RIGHT UNDERNEATH OUR NOSES
THE THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY DIRECTING A BILLION PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS
STUDIED AT A LAB CALLED THE PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY LAB AT STANFORD THAT TAUGHT STUDENTS HOW TO RECOGNIZE EXACTLY THESE TECHNIQUES THERE'S CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS THAT TEACH PEOPLE ALL THESE COVERT WAYS OF GETTING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AND ORCHESTRATING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND IT'S BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT EXISTS THAT THIS CONVERSATION IS SO IMPORTANT CA
TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT THE HUMAN ARCHITECTURE IS LIMITED AND THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN BOUNDARIES OR DIMENSIONS OF OUR LIVES THAT WE WANT TO BE HONORED AND RESPECTED AND TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP DO THAT
EVEN IF YOU COULD PROPOSE THE PERFECT NEXT VIDEO THAT EVERYONE WOULD WANT TO WATCH IT WOULD JUST BE BETTER AND BETTER AT KEEPING YOU HOOKED ON THE SCREEN SO WHAT'S MISSING IN THAT
IF YOU SWIPE OVER THAT NOTIFICATION IT SCHEDULES YOU INTO SPENDING A LITTLE BIT OF TIME GETTING SUCKED INTO SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO GET SUCKED INTO
AND IT BECOMES THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BRAIN STEM OF WHO CAN GO LOWER TO GET IT LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF SNAPCHAT
NOW IF THIS IS MAKING YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF OUTRAGE NOTICE THAT THAT THOUGHT JUST COMES OVER YOU OUTRAGE IS A REALLY GOOD WAY ALSO OF GETTING YOUR ATTENTION
YOU HAVE THIS VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE THAT YOU CAN STEER THE TIMELINES OF A BILLION PEOPLE JUST IMAGINE
HAVE A TEMPTATION TO THINK ABOUT THIS AS OH THEY'RE JUST USING SNAPCHAT THE WAY WE USED TO GOSSIP ON THE TELEPHONE IT'S PROBABLY OK
WELL WHAT THIS MISSES IS THAT IN THE 1970S WHEN YOU WERE JUST GOSSIPING ON THE TELEPHONE
THERE WASN'T A HUNDRED ENGINEERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN WHO KNEW EXACTLY HOW YOUR PSYCHOLOGY WORKED AND ORCHESTRATED YOU INTO A DOUBLE BIND WITH EACH OTHER
IS THAT FOR TEENAGERS AND THERE'S LIKE HUNDRED MILLION OF THEM THAT USE IT AND THEY INVENTED A FEATURE CALLED SNAPSTREAKS WHICH SHOWS THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN ROW THAT TWO PEOPLE HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OTHER
WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING US ALL GET A LITTLE BIT WISER ABOUT THIS TRISTAN HARRIS THANK YOU TH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THEY WOULD WANT TO SHOW YOU THE OUTRAGE FEED NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE CONSCIOUSLY CHOSE THAT BUT BECAUSE THAT WORKED BETTER AT GETTING YOUR ATTENTION
AND
THE NEWSFEED CONTROL ROOM IS NOT
ACCOUNTABLE TO US
IT'S ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO MAXIMIZING ATTENTION
AND THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION IS TO KNOW HOW SOMEONE'S MIND WORKS AND THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF PERSUASIVE TECHNIQUES
AGAINST THE TIMELINES THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE EXPERIENCING THE THOUGHTS THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE HAPPENING SO THAT WHEN THAT DING HAPPENS NOT HAVING THE DING THAT SENDS US AWAY
CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BEING ABLE TO COORDINATE THEIR ATTENTION IN THE MOST EMPOWERING WAY TOGETHER AND IMAGINE CREATING A SUPERHUMAN ABILITY TO DO THAT
BECAUSE EVERY NEWS SITE TED ELECTIONS POLITICIANS GAMES EVEN MEDITATION APPS HAVE TO COMPETE FOR ONE THING WHICH IS OUR ATTENTION AND THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
BUT WHICH PREFERENCE THERE'S THE PREFERENCES OF THINGS THAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT
WE COULD SOLVE THE RUNAWAY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT ALREADY EXISTS RIGHT NOW WHICH ARE THESE NEWSFEEDS MAXIMIZING FOR ONE THING IT'S ALMOST LIKE INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY TO COLONIZE NEW PLANETS WE COULD FIX THE ONE THAT WE'RE ALREADY ON
INSTEAD OF GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THE MOST EXCITING NEW COOL FANCY EDUCATION APPS WE COULD FIX THE WAY KIDS' MINDS ARE GETTING MANIPULATED INTO SENDING EMPTY MESSAGES BACK AND FORTH
IMPLANT THAT MORE NUANCED VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE IN EVERY DESIGN WOULD THAT BE A STEP FORWARD TH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE WANT TO PROTECT THE SECOND IS WE NEED NEW MODELS AND ACCOUNTABILITY
TRISTAN YOU AND I WE BOTH KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE FROM ALL THESE COMPANIES THERE ARE ACTUALLY
WHICH WOULD BE AT HOME THAT NIGHT WITH A BUNCH OF A FRIENDS OVER TO TALK ABOUT IT SO IMAGINE WE'RE RUNNING LIKE A FIND AND REPLACE
WANT YOU TO IMAGINE WALKING INTO A ROOM A CONTROL
THE WORLD'S MORE INTERESTING THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT TRISTAN HARRIS I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING ONE WAY TO SEE THIS IS IF YOU'RE JUST YOUTUBE FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT TO ALWAYS SHOW THE MORE INTERESTING NEXT VIDEO YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AND BETTER AT SUGGESTING THAT NEXT
WELL IMAGINE AN ENTIRE DESIGN RENAISSANCE THAT TRIED TO ORCHESTRATE THE EXACT AND MOST EMPOWERING TIME WELL SPENT WAY FOR THOSE TIMELINES TO HAPPEN AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE TWO THINGS
YOU WANTED TO POST SOMETHING SUPERCONTROVERSIAL ON FACEBOOK WHICH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO BE ABLE TO DO TO TALK ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS
AND RIGHT NOW WHEN THERE'S THAT BIG COMMENT BOX IT'S ALMOST ASKING YOU WHAT KEY DO YOU WANT TO TYPE
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S SCHEDULING A LITTLE TIMELINE OF THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO ON THE SCREEN
AND IMAGINE INSTEAD THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER BUTTON THERE SAYING WHAT WOULD BE MOST TIME WELL SPENT FOR YOU AND YOU CLICK HOST A DINNER
DON'T WANT THAT TO GO AWAY AND SO THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOCKS OF TIME THAT THAT SCHEDULES IN KIDS' MINDS THIS ISN'T THEORETICAL WHEN KIDS GO ON VACATION IT'S BEEN SHOWN THEY GIVE THEIR PASSWORDS TO UP TO FIVE OTHER FRIENDS TO KEEP THEIR SNAPSTREAKS GOING
IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SOLVING EVERY OTHER PROBLEM THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR LIFE OR IN OUR COLLECTIVE PROBLEMS THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE OUR ABILITY TO PUT OUR ATTENTION WHERE WE CARE ABOUT
WILL BE TIME WELL SPENT FOR OURS THANK YOU
THAT HAVE REALLY GOT OUT OF CONTROL TH OF THIS RACE FOR ATTENTION IT'S THE CLASSIC RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHEN YOU HAVE TO GET ATTENTION AND IT'S SO TENSE THE ONLY WAY TO GET MORE IS TO GO LOWER ON THE BRAIN STEM TO GO LOWER INTO OUTRAGE TO GO LOWER INTO EMOTION TO GO LOWER INTO THE LIZARD
TODAY LET'S SAY YOUR FRIEND CANCELS DINNER ON YOU AND YOU ARE FEELING A LITTLE BIT LONELY AND SO WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT MOMENT YOU OPEN UP FACEBOOK
WAY USING ALL OF THEIR DATA TO ACTUALLY HELP YOU GET OUT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU CARE ABOUT
BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IS HOW THE HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WORKING AT A HANDFUL OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THROUGH THEIR CHOICES WILL STEER WHAT A BILLION PEOPLE ARE THINKING TODAY
IT'S CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE HAVE OUR CONVERSATIONS IT'S CHANGING OUR DEMOCRACY AND IT'S CHANGING OUR ABILITY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS WE WANT WITH EACH OTHER
BECAUSE WE DON'T CHOOSE OUTRAGE IT HAPPENS TO US AND IF YOU'RE THE FACEBOOK NEWSFEED WHETHER YOU'D WANT TO OR NOT YOU ACTUALLY BENEFIT WHEN THERE'S OUTRAGE BECAUSE OUTRAGE DOESN'T JUST SCHEDULE A REACTION IN EMOTIONAL TIME SPACE FOR YOU
TO PUT OUR ATTENTION TO WHAT WE CARED ABOUT AND SUPERHUMAN ABILITY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE FOR DEMOCRACY
PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE'VE GOT A NA VE MODEL OF HUMAN NATURE SO MUCH OF THIS IS JUSTIFIED IN TERMS OF HUMAN PREFERENCE WHERE WE'VE GOT THESE ALGORITHMS THAT DO AN AMAZING JOB OF OPTIMIZING FOR HUMAN PREFERENCE
AND THE SECOND WOULD BE EMPOWERING US TO LIVE OUT THE TIMELINE THAT WE WANT SO LET ME GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
THEM IT'S ACTUALLY INTERESTING ALL THESE DESIGN DECISIONS HAVE BUILT USER CONTENT THAT IS
WHO HAVE SOME DESIRE ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE THINKING AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE FEELING AND HOW THEY WANT TO BE INFORMED AND WE'RE ALL
SO I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE COSTS ARE SO OBVIOUS
LEARNED IN COLLEGE AT A LAB CALLED THE PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY LAB TO GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION
BUT THIS ACTUALLY EXISTS RIGHT NOW TODAY
THINK ALLEVIATING ALL LONELINESS IN SOCIETY IF THAT WAS THE TIMELINE THAT FACEBOOK WANTED TO MAKE POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE OR IMAGINE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION
DETERMINED TO SPREAD AWARENESS
ABOUT
ANXIETY DISORDERS IN GENERAL IS THAT MY OWN SYMPTOMS WERE NOT ALWAYS THIS SEVERE
SO I WANT TO START AT THE BEGINNING
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN OBSESSIVE MINDED CHILD I
WOULD TAKE A THING GOOD OR BAD AND
I WAS DOWN TO A SIZE ZERO AND THAT MONKEY WAS SAYING YOU CAN GET SKINNIER
AND
I DIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT THAT I HAD A PROBLEM I WANTED TO FEEL LIKE WAS KICKING ASS
BUT I KNEW DEEP DOWN
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
BECAUSE
I WASN'T SLEEPING AND
MY MARRIAGE WAS GOING THROUGH THE SHITTER
BUT
TRYING TO EVEN THINK ABOUT CHANGING MY HABITS REALLY THINKING ABOUT CHANGING ANY OF MY HABITS WOULD GIVE ME MASSIVE ANXIETY
AND THIS ANXIETY WAS LEADING TO PANIC ATTACKS
PANIC ATTACKS ARE ONE OF THE MOST
FRIGHTENING
MANIFESTATIONS OF ANXIETY
I KNOW
THERE FOR THEM AND YOU UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS CAN BE A STRUGGLE
IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
HELP IS AVAILABLE IN MANY FORMS
I STARTED GETTING HELP BY WORKING WITH MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BUT THERE ARE ALSO
WHAT YOU CAN DO
IS LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE THERE FOR THEM
IT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL HELPLESS
BUT YOUR PRESENCE IS MORE COMFORTING THAN YOU MAY REALIZE
AND THEN WHEN IT'S OVER
THEN YOU CAN ASK
WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR NEXT TIME
IF ANYTHING REALLY
BUT ONE THING WE CAN ALL DO
IS WORK TOGETHER TO END THE STIGMA SURROUNDING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS LIKE ANXIETY
SO THAT EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS HELP CAN FEEL SAFE IN ASKING FOR IT
YOU CAN HELP BY SHOWING RESPECT TO PEOPLE WHO SEEK THE AID OF THERAPISTS PSYCHIATRISTS AND MEDICATIONS
INSTEAD OF TELLING SOMEONE TO WORK HARDER OR WORRY LESS
THOUGHTS STARTED GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER THIS CLICKER SUCKS
ME FROM ALL CORNERS OF MY LIFE ON THE INTERNET
TO TELL ME ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES
AND TO THANK ME FOR SPEAKING OUT AND TOLD ME I WAS BRAVE IT
GOT ME THINKING YOU KNOW
THESE DAYS EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE AN AWARENESS MONTH
OR A RIBBON OR SOME
THAT IT COULD HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT
ANY PLACE AT HOME AT WORK
AT THE TATTOO PARLOR
THAT'S HAPPENED
AND NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT EVEN THOUGH LOT OF PEOPLE GO THROUGH IT
WHEN I FIRST POSTED TO MY BLOG
ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES WITH PANIC ATTACKS I WAS SURPRISED WHEN PEOPLE STARTED
THAT COULD HAPPEN BY CHANCE OR BECAUSE EVERYBODY SECRETLY HATES ME
AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE
THESE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS ARE REALLY QUITE ANXIETY PRODUCING
AND THIS ANXIETY CAN MANIFEST IN DIFFERENT PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES
ONE OF WHICH IS THE
DATING MYSELF
I WAS OBSESSED WITH STAR WARS I
SORT OF STILL AM
LIKE I GOT IN TROUBLE FOR COMING HOME LATE FOR CURFEW ONCE AS A TEENAGER AND AS PUNISHMENT MY PARENTS TOOK AWAY MY STAR WARS STUFF
AND I THOUGHT THAT THE WORLD HAD COLLAPSED
I ALSO HAD ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN ISSUES WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION REALLY GO HAND IN HAND LIKE TWO BEST FRIENDS WHO LIKE TO CORNER THIRD PERSON AND MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE SHIT
SO THERE I
FACEBOOK
TO SPREAD AWARENESS WELL
I'VE MADE THIS MY PANIC ATTACK AWARENESS EFFORT AND NOW I HOPE YOU ALL KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THEY REALLY FEEL LIKE
AS FOR ME
MY HUSBAND DID FINALLY GET ME TO SEE A DOCTOR
IT TURNS OUT THAT MY ANXIETY AND OBSESSIVE TENDENCIES HAD BASICALLY BEEN GIVEN STEROIDS BY THE CONCUSSION AND I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SEVERE OCD AND WE STARTED THE DANCE OF TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF MEDS AND THERAPY
WE'RE STILL FIGURING IT OUT
I STILL HAVE PANIC ATTACKS
BUT
YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF SHY AWKWARD PEOPLE AND ALL OF US HAVE OUR LITTLE OBSESSIONS
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A SCALE FOR BEING SHY AWKWARD AND OBSESSIVE BUT I ALWAYS FELT LIKE I WAS TOWARD THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE
WEIRDO AND FREAK WERE TERMS I READILY ACCEPTED AS A TEENAGER
AND WHEN ALL THE
WHAT SIR KEN TALKS ABOUT AND WHAT HE FOCUSES ON IN FACT WHAT MANY PEOPLE IN MANY TED TALKS HAVE FOCUSED ON IS EDUCATIONAL REFORM
NOW I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH KEN ROBINSON THAT WE NEED TO TRANSFORM EDUCATION WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN PARTICULAR IS
TO HELP CHILDREN RETAIN AND BUILD THEIR CREATIVITY
COSTUME NOW I'M NOT SAYING TO YOU DON'T BUY YOUR KIDS TOYS OF COURSE WE SHOULD
NOW THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS I'VE EXPLAINED THIS TO MY WIFE AND MY SON CHARLIE OVERHEARD HE COMES TO ME EVERYDAY NOW AND TELLS ME
THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME FOR REFLECTION AND INTROSPECTION PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR TEENAGERS GAMING IS VERY INTERESTING I READ PAPER RECENTLY ABOUT GAMING NOW CREATIVITY INVOLVES INVENTIVE AND EXPRESSIVE CREATIVITY AND THOSE TWO OF COURSE COME TOGETHER
THE BIG DRESSER BOXES NOW WHAT'S THE PROBLEM A BIG PROBLEM WITH MODERN SOCIETY IS THAT WE HAVE THE TOY INDUSTRIES AND THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRIES AND WHAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS BRING IS PRETTY FABRICATED IMAGINATION
BEFORE I MET THE COUPLE ACTUALLY I MET THE GRANDMOTHER YOU KNOW ONE OF THESE OLD GREEK LADIES WHO LOOK LIKE DARTH VADER {LG} YOU KNOW I REMEMBER I WAS IN THE FRONT YARD AND THEN
DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE REMOVING THE HIGH CLIMBING BARS FROM PLAYGROUNDS WHY BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID KIDS WILL GET HURT
WHAT THE MESSAGE WE SENT TO OUR CHILDREN IS CREATIVITY IS PRESENT IN EVERY FIELD OF ENDEAVOR IT'S IN BUSINESS IT'S IN ART IT'S IN MUSIC IT'S IN SPORTS AND OF COURSE IT'S IN BUSINESS
BUT WE CELEBRATE THAT
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IMPORTANT HERE AND THAT IS DIVERGENT THINKING
SO MUCH OF THE PROBLEM WITH MODERN EDUCATION IS THAT IT ENCOURAGES LINEAR THINKING ONE RIGHT ANSWER SO WHAT I DO A LOT WITH MY CHIDREN IS I GIVE THEM RIDDLES
LITTLE BOY CHARLIE HE RECENTLY CAME TO ME AND SAID PAPA
CAN I BORROW YOUR CHAINSAW
WELL I SAID YES OF COURSE YOU CAN CHARLIE OK BUT OF COURSE I SUPERVISED HIM BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT A TREE FALLING ON THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE OR SOMETHING BUT
YOU SEE THIS IS
SCHOOLS THAT KILL CREATIVITY IT'S ALSO PARENTS THAT KILL CREATIVITY SO IN FACT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS PROVIDE KIDS THE RESOURCES THEY
WHAT DO THEY FIND THEY FIND NAILS AND SAWS AND HAMMERS AND SO ON AND THEY CONSTRUCT STUFF THEY BUILD THEIR OWN TREE HOUSE NOW THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT KIDS ALSO NEED TO DO TO KEEP THEIR CREATIVITY IS TO EXPERIMENT AND THEY NEED TO FAIL
I MEAN YOU CAN ALSO BOOST IT WITH COCAINE AND
SO IT'S GOING
TO BE
TROUBLE OK 41156321
NOW WHAT DOES THAT NUMBER REPRESENT WHAT THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY REPRESENTS IS THE MOST WATCHED TED TALK OF ALL TIME BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MANY VIEWS SIR KEN ROBINSON'S TALK HAS HAD
AND WHAT DID SIR KEN ROBINSON TALK ABOUT HE SPOKE ABOUT EDUCATION
BUT IN PARTICULAR WHAT HE FOCUSED ON WAS THE PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION BECAUSE WHAT
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH KEN ROBINSON I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE TED SPEAKERS WHO TALKED ON THIS TOPIC BUT IT'S NOT
THAT WE PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON OUR KIDS IN TERMS OF UNIVERSITY AND ENTRANCE AND ALL THAT STUFF
SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS IN THE WORLD THEY NEVER FINISHED UNIVERSITY
AND MANY OF THOSE THAT DID FINISH UNIVERSITY THE PEOPLE WHO GO ON TO CREATE THE RIGHT THINGS OFTEN THEY DO IT IN FIELDS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR STUDIES SO LET'S PUT A LITTLE BIT LESS PRESSURE ON THE KIDS
THE OTHER THING
AT CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT I'VE LOOKED AT PSYCHOLOGY AND MORE RECENTLY I'VE EVEN LOOKED AT NEUROSCIENCE SO WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU OVER THE NEXT TEN MINUTES OR SO IS WHAT HAVE DISCOVERED
WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED FROM THE RESEARCH BUT NOT JUST WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED FROM THE RESEARCH WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PRACTICING IN OUR HOME SO ALL THESE PHOTOS YOU'LL SEE IT'S JUST THE KIDS IT'S OUR HOUSE
SO
WHAT DO WE KNOW
WHAT DO WE KNOW THE
THE BREAKFAST TABLE FEW WEEKS AGO AND I GAVE HIM RIDDLE AND RIES TURNED TO ME AND SAID PAPA WE ARE HERE TO EAT NOT TO HAVE FUN
THEM EXPLORE NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HERE BECAUSE IN OUR HOUSE WHAT WE DO IS WE CELEBRATE CREATIVITY IN THE BOOKCASE I'M A BIG FAN OF BANSKY THE GRAFFITI ARTIST THERE'RE BOOKS ABOUT BANSKY I TALKED TO HANNAH ABOUT THE MEANING OF THAT ART
ARE HAPPY AND HEALTHY AND LOVED THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO IN OUR HOUSE I GIVE MY WIFE MY THREE KIDS SEVEN HUGS A DAY AND THEN I SAY ENOUGH {LG} NO I AM JUST KIDDING BUT WE DO TALK ABOUT THE OXY HAVE YOU HAD YOUR HUG QUOTA TODAY BECAUSE IT IS
AND IT'S NOT HER HAND
WHAT IS THAT
AS ADULTS WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM THINKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS DIVERGENT
THE ANSWER IS A HOLE
YOU SEE IF YOU PRACTICE THESE THINGS WITH YOUR KIDS IT DEVELOPS DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS IN THEIR
NOW
THE THING ABOUT CREATIVITY IS SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME TO EVOLVE SO THE LAST THING WE SHOULD DO IS CLEAN UP AFTER EVERY CHILDHOOD PLAY SESSION BECAUSE ACTUALLY SOMETIMES CREATIVITY TAKES DAYS WE SHOULD ALLOW FOR THOSE MULTI DAY PLAY ACTIVITIES
THE OTHER THING WE DO AS MODERN PARENTS IS WE OVERSTRUCTURE
OUR KID'S TIME WE PLAN EVERYTHING FOR THEM AND IN FACT WHAT CHILDREN NEED IS UNSTRUCTURED TIME
SO THE NEXT TIME YOUR CHILDREN COME TO YOU AND SAY I'M BORED
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU SAY GREAT GO OUTSIDE
BECAUSE
ECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT I WANT MY KIDS TO BE READY SO THEREFORE WHAT I HAVE REALIZED AND INCREASINGLY REALIZE IS IT'S NOT JUST SCHOOLS
WHERE THEY CAN REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL ISN'T THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU AS THE THOUGHT LEADERS
IN THE ABSENCE OF MY OWN DAD DARYL SERVED AND PROVIDED UNWAVERING
DAY ONLY WITH LONG SLEEVED SHIRTS ON IN 30 DEGREE WEATHER OR IT WAS THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE WOULD COME AND SAY HEY I
WHEN I'VE USED 90 OF MY CHARGE CARD AVAILABILITY TO BUY MY FRIEND A COAT BECAUSE HE WALKED AROUND
THAT THIS PHENOMENAL POWER LIES IN ME IT LIES IN YOU IT LIES IN THE SPARKS THAT PEOPLE CAN CREATE PEOPLE SUCH
AND THAT SPARK FOR MANY PEOPLE TURNED INTO HUGE FLAMES AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS WENT OUT TO LIGHT UP THE WORLD AND THEY WERE LOVING IT BUT IT WAS ALSO AT THOSE MOMENTS THAT I COULD HEAR THE VOICES
YOU MAY START ASK YOURSELF OK SO WHAT'S THE REWARD WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME I CAN SHOW YOU BETTER THAT I CAN TELL YOU
WERE MEANT TO DO AND ONE OF THEM IS TO BE THE SPARK IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS NOW AT TIMES YOU MIGHT BECOME DOUBTFUL SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WELL THE FIRST STEP IS TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST FEAR BECAUSE
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY SO I WENT FOR IT AND
OF INSPIRATION IT'S UPON US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CONSCIOUSLY CAREFULLY AND CREATIVELY DESIGN THESE EXPERIENCES FOR THEM TODAY
OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE ARE ALL IN NEED SOME OF US MORE THAN OTHERS AND IN A WORLD WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO FORM
THE IDEA IN ME TO BE CONFIDENT IN ALL THINGS I DO
CREATIVELY DESIGN AN EVEN BETTER WORLD SIMPLY THROUGH ONE OPPORTUNITY AT A TIME
TO EXPAND IN THE LANDSCAPE OF CONNECTION AND ALSO THOUGHT IF YOU REMEMBER THE WORDS OF PREVIOUS SPEAKER DR BREN BROWN SHE HAS ALREADY
AND CLOSER TO MAKING THAT DREAM A REALITY I AM BLESSED AND FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO STAND HERE TODAY TO SAY THAT I AM
FOR IT BECAUSE THEIR LIVES MATTER IN TERMS OF CREATING AN EVEN BETTER WORLD
THAT HELPED TO MAKE SURE MY FLAME WAS ALWAYS SUSTAINED AND LASTLY
TO FAVORABLY IMPACT MY FAMILY MYSELF MY FRIENDS AND MY COMMUNITY SO IN CLOSING I WISH TO LEAVE ALL OF YOU WITH THIS
OF MEMPHIS I STARTED TO REFLECT ON ALL OF THESE MOMENTS
TO OUR IDEA OF SUCCESS WITH FEW TO MINIMAL BARRIERS
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING IT'S JUST TOO BIG OF CHASM TO CROSS THE LAST
WILL BE NO INDEPENDENT APPS ON THE IPHONE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS USE THE SAFARI ENGINE THAT'S WHAT THAT TRANSLATES TO
IS NOT THE SAME AS PRICE BECAUSE VALUE INCORPORATES OTHER QUALITIES
IT IN 2008 WHEN IT SAID YOU CAN SHIP ANY APP YOU CAN CREATE ANY APP GOES BACK TO POINT 1 EXPERTS ARE CLUELESS {LG} NEXT THING I LEARNED FROM STEVE JOBS
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE BELIEVE IT OR NOT WHEN THE IPHONE FIRST CAME
TO ME IS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE LOWEST PRICE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BEST VALUE APPLE DID A GREAT SERIES OF ADS ABOUT THIS
PLAYERS HIRE E PLAYERS AND PRETTY SOON YOU HAVE
CAN DEVELOP INDEPENDENT APPS FOR IPHONE THEY'VE GONE FROM A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE TO
HE WAS SAYING WE'RE DOING THIS AS A FAVOR TO YOU BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE SECURE AND RELIABLE {LG}
EFFECT ON MY LIFE AS WELL AS REALLY THE VALLEY AND
YOU GOTTA STICK TO THIS CONCLUSION BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT AND YOU BELIEVE AND I THINK WHAT APPLE IS PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS THAT IF
SAFARI
TO WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO USE INDEPENDENT APPS OF COURSE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY THAT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS INTENDED
THIS IS A SIGN OF GREAT INTELLIGENCE THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPLETELY FLIP THOUGHT AND YOU KNOW WHAT
NOBODY POINTED OUT THIS COMPLETE REVERSAL
THE PRESS LOVED IT WHEN THEY SAID OH
BIG FONTS BIG FONTS THE BEAUTY OF A BIG FONT IS IT MAKES IT SO THAT YOU CANNOT PUT LOT OF TEXT ON YOUR PRESENTATION YOU DON'T WANT A LOT OF TEXT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT A LOT OF TEXT YOU READ THE
IMPORTANT MISSION IT WAS TO COMPLETE HUMANKIND'S FIRST RECONNAISSANCE OF OUR
PLUTO WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR STORY
NOW THAT MEANS WHEN AN ICE GOES DIRECTLY INTO A GAS AND WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME IN COLORADO
OUR SNOW DOESN'T MELT LIKE ELSEWHERE
SO MAYBE CREATING AN IMPACT CRATER IN THIS REGION IS A LOT LIKE MAKING FOOTPRINT IN THE COLORADO SNOW IT
WAS NEVER DESTINED TO STAND THE TEST OF TIME
IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS BOMBARDED BY METEORITES IT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE AND METEORITES CREATE
FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN
THEY'RE VERY NEW BECAUSE THEY'RE SHARP AND POINTY STILL BUT UNLIKE OUR OWN ROCKY ROCKY MOUNTAINS THESE ARE MADE OF WATER ICE {NS} {NS} SEE PLUTO SIMPLY ISN'T HEAVY ENOUGH FOR THESE TO BE MADE OF ROCK
I COULDN'T LEAVE YOU WITHOUT TOUCHING ON ONLY ONE MORE IMAGE OF PLUTO AND THIS IS AN IMAGE THAT WAS DOWNLINKED THIS WEEK
OUR SURPRISE AND SLIGHT CONFUSION WHEN WE FINALLY RESOLVED THIS OBJECT ONLY TO FIND THAT IT
FUNNY AND IT'S INCREDIBLY HARD AND IT COULD DO THINGS THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE HERE ON EARTH LIKE FORM MOUNTAINS SO IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WITH THE RIGHT GEAR YOU COULD TOTALLY SKI ON PLUTO {LG}
COMMAND THAT WE SEND IT TAKES FOUR AND A HALF HOURS TO REACH THE SPACECRAFT AND EVERYTHING IT WANTS TO TELL US TAKES FOUR AND HALF HOURS TO REACH
IT WASN'T REALLY THE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH BECAUSE WE WEREN'T RUNNING WINDOWS XP {LG}
WHY DID WE SEND A SPACECRAFT ALL OF THAT WAY WELL THIS LITTLE SPACE ROBOT
PLUTO ALSO HAS A SERIES OF SMALL MOONS ONE OF WHICH IS CALLED NIX
OR THE BACK ROW OF THIS AUDIENCE TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE COLOR OF THAT SINGLE HAIR OF MY HEAD IS LIKE IT'S A TOUGH THING TO DO
A HUMAN BEING I WONDER AT ITS BEAUTY WAS PLUTO WORTH THE WAIT I'LL LET YOU DECIDE BUT I SURE KNOW WHAT I THINK THANK YOU
BEFORE OUR ENCOUNTER WITH PLUTO AND BOY ARE WE GLAD WE WERE
WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US NOW AND THIS WAS THE IMAGE THAT WE CONSTRUCTED
EMPLOYMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY IT'S UNSTABLE
TRAINING MAYBE YOU'VE GOT AN INTERNSHIP BUT YOUR VISION
AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE FROM THE
AND IT GOES WHILE WE'RE LIVING THE DREAMS WE HAVE AS CHILDREN FADE AWAY
WHAT IF WE WOULD CHANGE THAT STATEMENT INTO RAP IS FOR THE CHILDREN AND WITH THIS I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOUNTER HOW I CAME TO RAP FOR THE FIRST TIME
BAGGY BAGGY JEANS LONG GOLD CHAINS AND SOME NICE SWAGGY SHOES
THIS
IS THE TYPICAL REACTION I
GET
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME
LEANDER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN YOUR FREE TIME
AND I'M SAYING
YEAH YOU KNOW I LOVE TO DO MUSIC
AND THEN THEY SAY SHIZ NICE
WHICH KIND OF INSTRUMENTS ARE YOU PLAYING
AND I'M SAYING YEAH YOU KNOW I
USED TO PLAY INSTRUMENTS
NOW I'M DOING SOMETHING WITH WORDS THAT RHYME I'M DOING RAP
AND
THEN THE REACTION IS A MINUTE OF SILENCE
AND THEN THERE'S OH SO COOL OR THEY JUST LEAVE IT BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY FIT IN THAT IMAGE OF A TYPICAL RAPPER
BUT RAP IS WAY MORE THAN THESE STEREOTYPES
HAD A HUGE INFLUENCE BUT IS THERE SOMETHING OR COULD THERE BE SOMEONE NEW LIKE A NEW N W A AND I CAME UP WITH THE ANSWER YES THERE IS AND HIS NAME IS KENDRICK LAMAR {NS}
IN SANFORD IN CALIFORNIA AND IN YEARS OF RAISING POLICE BRUTALITY AGAINST AFRO AMERICANS N W A AND FUCK THA POLICE IS BECOMING AND NEEDS TO BECOME RELEVANT AGAIN IN REALLY SAD WAY
ME HOW I CAN IMPACT HOW I CAN TOUCH PEOPLE WITH MY MUSIC AND WITH IMPACT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU MY TODAY'S TALKING TOPIC HOW CAN RAP CHANGE THE FABRICS
BORN AND RAISED IN COMPTON
ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DISTRICTS IN LOS ANGELES
AND KENDRICK LAMAR GOT DISCOVERED BY DR DRE
WHO AS WELL DISCOVERED EMINEM
AND WHO IS A FORMER MEMBER OR N W A
BUT WHAT MAKES KENDRICK LAMAR
FOR THOSE OF
YOU WHO DON'T KNOW KENDRICK LAMAR FAMOUS IS HIS BREAKTHROUGH ALBUM GOOD KID M A A D CITY
HE JUST RECEIVED 11 GRAMMY NOMINATIONS
FOR HIS 2015 ALBUM TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY
WHICH IS A RECORD IN RAP HISTORY
IS THE EXPRESSION FORM FOR EVERYBODY
BECAUSE OF ITS OPENNESS
RAWNESS
AND TRUTH
YOU CAN EXPRESS
HUMAN EMOTIONS OR EXTREMES
LIKE PRESSURE FEAR ANGER AND HAPPINESS FOR RAP
LET US COME BACK TO N W A AND FUCK THA POLICE
DO YOU THINK
N W A WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL AND CONTROVERSIAL
IF THEY HAD WRITTEN A LETTER
TO THE LAPD STATING DEAR LAPD
WE'RE STRONGLY DISAGREEING WITH THE POLICE BRUTALITY AGAINST US THANK YOU
DEAR N W
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS MOVEMENT THAT REFUGEES ARE GETTING WELCOMED
AND INTEGRATED INTO GERMAN SOCIETY
YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF
WHY ALL THESE RAPPERS ARE DOING THIS
WHY
IS KENDRICK LAMAR SO INVOLVED IN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT
WHY
IS N W A
SO ACTIVE IN RAISING AWARENESS AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY AND WHY ARE GERMAN RAPPERS SO ACTIVE
IN
REFUGEES WELCOME
THERE'S ONE REASON
RAP
IS THE VOICE OF THE VOICELESS
OR PEOPLE'S LIVES
IN A POSITIVE WAY
WHAT I ALWAYS USED TO LOVE ABOUT RAP OR WHAT I LOVE ABOUT RAP WHY AM RAPPING IS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM IN RAP IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST
IT JUST MATTERS
AND THAT'S WHY I'M RAPPING
THAT YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE
I'M RAPPING BECAUSE I'M FEELING I CAN EXPRESS MYSELF IN THIS WAY I'M THE MOST MYSELF I'M 100 MYSELF WHEN I'M RAPPING
AND I'M NOT A FAKE SOMEONE WHO I NEED TO BE FOR ANYBODY ELSE
WITH RAP
YOU CAN BREAK OUT
OF YOUR OWN REALITIES
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A
GANGSTA RAPPER OUT OF COMPTON OR IF YOU'RE A
SKINNY WHITE BOY
THEY'RE GREAT I LOVE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
BECAUSE THEY'RE EXACTLY THE WAY HOW THEY ARE
WHEN THEY RAP ABOUT VIOLENCE WITH THE AUTO TUNE
WHEN THEY RAP ABOUT DRUGS WHEN THEY RAP ABOUT THEIR FAVORITE STRIP CLUB
THEY RAP ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIFE
ABOUT THE REPRESENTATION OF ATLANTA
WHY
BECAUSE ATLANTA
IS THE MOST
DOMINANT AND INFLUENTIAL CITY IN RAP RIGHT NOW
AND BESIDES THIS
IT IS THE SIXTH MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN THE US
IT HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MURDER RATES IN THE COUNTRY AND IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR DRUG TRAFFICKING ROUTES
ATLANTA'S
RAP OR RAP SCENE IS REALLY CONTROVERSIAL
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE SIDE WHO ARE SAYING
THEY LACK ORIGINALITY
THEY HAVE FAKE FLOWS THEY USE TOO MUCH AUTO TUNE
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHAT THEY'RE
IS FOR THE CHILDREN THE
STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE WU TANG CLAN MEMBER OL' DIRTY BASTARD
THE WU TANG CLAN WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AND STILL IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS RAP GROUPS OF ALL TIME AND PER COINCIDENCE
THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RAP GROUPS JUST SAYING THEY'RE PLAYING CRAZY AND SHIZ LIVE SHOWS
RAISING POLICE BRUTALITY EVEN IF THERE ARE SHOOTINGS
IN
MY HOME COUNTRY GERMANY
A LOT OF REALLY FAMOUS RAPPERS
ARE ENGAGED IN THE CAMPAIGN OF REFUGEES WELCOME
WHY
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM
ARE REFUGEES OR IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES SO THEY KNOW HOW IT IS TO LIVE IN A WAR ZONE THEY KNOW HOW IT IS TO LEAVE OUT OF AN UNSTABLE HOME
WHO HAS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS PARENTS
WHO WAS QUITE OFTEN REALLY SICK SO I HAD A FEW PROBLEMS IN SCHOOL BUT
RAP CHANGED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS AND RAP IMPACTED ME IN A COMPLETELY NEW WAY
I THINK FIRST YOU NEED TO KNOW
THAT I'M OUT OF A FAMILY WHERE MY MOM IS AN ARTIST AND MY DAD IS A FILMMAKER AND ENTREPRENEUR
THAT MEANS I WAS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY LANGUAGE
ESPECIALLY THE GERMAN LANGUAGE
I WAS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY WORDS AND BY POETRY
BUT WRITING NEVER FASCINATED ME
WRITING WAS MORE SOMETHING I NEEDED TO DO FOR SCHOOL
GREETINGS TO MY PRIMARY TEACHER
FOR EVERY CRAPPY 10 LINE HOMEWORK THAT YOU GAVE ME I TOOK LITERALLY 4
SO SUCCESSFUL AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO HONEST
IF YOU OPEN UP THE ART FORM IF YOU OPEN UP RAP YOU CAN OPEN UP YOUR MIND IN COMPLETELY NEW WAY
IF YOU RESPECT
AND CHALLENGE OR QUESTION THE FREEDOM OF ART SUCH AS IN RAP
YOU CAN CREATE AND CHALLENGE
NEW PERSPECTIVES
TO
CONCLUDE THIS TALK
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS
HOW CAN WE SEE RAP AS A METHOD OF CHANGE
HOW CAN RAP STILL
WU TANG IS FOR THE CHILDREN NO WU TANG IS NOT FOR THE CHILDREN RAP IS NOT FOR THE CHILDREN UH UH RAP IS FOR EVERYONE THANKS A LOT
EXAMPLE
LET US GO A BIT BACK
IN RAP HISTORY
INTO THE YEAR OF 1988
BACK THEN
A RAP GROUP RELEASED A DEBUT ALBUM NOTHING SPECIAL
BUT THIS DEBUT ALBUM CHANGED RAP
AND THE NAME WAS STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON
THE GROUP WAS CALLED N W A
AND THE ALBUM
INCLUDED ONE HIT SINGLE CALLED FUCK THA
POLICE
FUCK THA POLICE WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL
BUT SPARKED A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS
IT EVEN WENT SO FAR THAT THE FBI WROTE A LETTER TO RUTHLESS RECORDS
STATING THAT STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON CAN'T BE RELEASED BECAUSE IT'S TOO CONTROVERSIAL
BUT N W A DIDN'T CARE
THEY STARTED THE REVOLUTION IN RAP
THEY ARE SEEN AS THE FOUNDERS OF THE PROBABLY MOST FAMOUS GENRE IN RAP TODAY
GANGSTA RAP
THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES TO RAP ABOUT THEIR DAILY STREET LIFE ABOUT THE GANG LIFE IN AN EXTREMELY OPEN HONEST AND BRUTAL
WAS DIRECTLY FASCINATED BY HIM I WAS FASCINATED BY HIS VOICE BY HIS RHYMES BY HIS CRAZINESS AND BY HIS FLOW
BUT ONE THING STUCK OUT ONE THING FASCINATED ME WAY MORE WITH ALL THESE RAPPERS I STARTED LISTENING
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL SOMETHING I WASN'T
I WASN'T EMINEM
WHO WAS CRUISING OR WHO WAS LIVING
IN A TRAILER PARK WITH HIS MOM IN
MANY YEARS AGO AS I WAS GETTING READY TO MOVE ABROAD I WENT TO THE INTERNET AND I SPENT HOURS ON GOOGLE SEARCHING FOR THE STORIES AND COMMUNITIES OF WOMEN OF COLOR THAT WERE LIVING IN THE COUNTRY
AND AS I WAS DOING THAT EVERYTHING THAT I FOUND WAS EITHER A NEGATIVE NARRATIVE OR AN X RATED WEBSITE AND I WAS BAFFLED WONDERING HOW THIS IS POSSIBLE IN THE YEAR 2014 YOU
SEE JUST A FEW YEARS PRIOR I HAD SPENT SIX MONTHS IN THE COUNTRY AND I'D HAD A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE SO I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THESE ARE THE ONLY THINGS THAT WERE BEING SHARED
NOW YOU SEE IN A RECENT PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY ON BRANDS AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR IT WAS FOUND THAT CONSUMERS WANT BRANDS TO DO 3 THINGS
TO SHARE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION
TO BE ALIGNED WITH THEIR PERSONALITY AND TO CREATE A SENSE OF TRUST AND RELIABILITY
SO AS A CREATOR WHEN YOU FIND THAT YOU CAN MAKE THIS CONNECTION WITH YOUR AUDIENCE THEN THAT'S WHAT REALLY KEY
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE
AND THEN YOU MAKE THE LIFE CHANGING DECISION
DO I STAY AND BECOME A FOLLOWER OR DO I CARRY ON WITH MY LIFE AS USUAL
NOW ODDS ARE AS YOU'RE SCROLLING THROUGH YOU FIND THAT THIS PERSON SHARES YOUR VALUES AND THEY'RE SEEM TRUSTWORTHY THEN YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
YOU'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW THIS PERSON EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
NOW
AS YOU DECIDE TO FOLLOW THIS PERSON YOU FIGURE OUT THAT IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH YOU YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO BECOME A LOYAL FOLLOWER
AND YOU'RE TYING AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH
NOW THE FIRST TIME THAT I TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH
I WAS 22 YEARS OLD AND GOING THROUGH A MAJOR LIFE TRANSITION
SO I DID WHAT MOST 22 YEAR OLDS WOULD DO
I WENT TO THE INTERNET
BUT ON THAT DAY I DECIDED TO SHARE MY STORY ABOUT HOW I QUIT MY JOB IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY AND DECIDED TO MOVE ABROAD
NOW AFTER I SHARED MY STORY IT WENT VIRAL AND I WAS OVERWHELMED AND SURPRISED BY THE NUMEROUS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD SENT ME MESSAGES EMAILS AND TWEETS SAYING HOW MY WORDS WERE EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED TO HEAR DURING THIS TIME OF THEIR LIVES
EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING THROUGH A SIMILAR SITUATION
OR BECAUSE MY STORY HAD EMPOWERED THEM TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THEIR OWN LIVES
AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHY YOUR PERSONAL STORIES AND EXPERIENCES CAN HAVE A MUCH BIGGER IMPACT ON THE WORLD THAN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE
NOW HAVING AN IMPACT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE MILLIONS OF INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBERS
BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN IS THAT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING CREATES A POSITIVE AND MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS
NOW
WHEN WE'RE MAKING A POSITIVE AND MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT AUTHENTICITY
IS KEY
YOU YES YOU WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO HUMANIZE THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN
THE STAGE
OR THE PLATFORMS
AND YOU REALIZE THAT THEY'RE JUST LIKE US
IF THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE THEN SO CAN WE
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SOMEONE WHO IS OVERLY SENSITIVE AND OVERLY OPTIMISTIC AND I USED TO TRY TO HIDE THOSE ASPECTS OF
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING UNIQUE TO SINGAPORE OVER 60 AND 80 OF AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS CAN NO LONGER SEE THE NIGHT SKIES FROM WHERE THEY STAYING
THAT'S GLOWING
WHAT IT'S DOING IS IT'S FORGING LIGHTER ELEMENTS INTO HEAVIER ELEMENTS THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED NUCLEAR FUSION
THAT'S HOW HYDROGEN BECOMES HELIUM BECOMES OXYGEN CARBON
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH UNTIL YOU REACH THE ELEMENT IRON
WHERE NUCLEAR FUSION DOES NOT WORK AT ALL
WHEN STAR TRIES TO FUSE IRON IT EXPLODES IN A DRAMATIC FASHION CALLED A SUPERNOVA
IT SPREADS OUT ALL THOSE PARTICLES IT HAS BEEN FORGING OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS
ONLY FOR IT TO BE PULLED BACK TOGETHER AGAIN TO FORM NEW STARS AND PLANETS LIKE OUR EARTH
THAT'S WHY WE ARE CALLED STARDUST WE ARE LITERALLY MADE OUT OF STARS'
PARTICLES THAT EXPLODED MILLIONS OF YEARS
WAS PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE SMARTPHONES WERE VERY PREVALENT SO I'M KIND OF A LITTLE
THIS IS ONE OF EIGHT PROTOTYPES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW
A NOISE REDUCTION LIBRARY WHICH IS AN AUTOMATED NOISE REDUCTION ALGORITHM SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT PROFESSIONAL ASTRONOMERS USE AND IN ONE FELL SWOOP ALL THREE DIFFICULTIES ARE SOLVED AND YOU CAN CAPTURE NIGHT SKIES WITH ONE
FAILURE HAPPENED ABOUT A DECADE PLUS AGO I WAS A STUDENT I WAS 14 YEARS OLD IN MY
TO CONVEY YOUR CREATIVE MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AND BEFORE I END TODAY'S SPEECH I'LL LET YOU GUYS TAKE A LOOK AT
THE MILKY WAY THEN THERE MILLIONS OF GALAXIES OUT THERE LIKE
WE BROUGHT THIS OUT ON A ROAD TRIP TO MELBOURNE AND WE MANAGED TO CAPTURE THE MILKY WAY WHAT SURPRISED US WAS WE MANAGED TO CATCH THE SOUTHERN LIGHTS SO KEEP A LOOKOUT ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN WHEN YOU SEE GREEN FLASHES THAT'S
WE MANAGED TO THANK YOU {NS} TO DATE WE HAVE RAISED OVER 500000 US DOLLARS IN PRE ORDERS AND I'M GLAD TO SAY THAT THIS THOUSAND UNITS IS GOING TO START SHIPPING 30 DAYS FROM NOW
TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY I CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE ONE DOING THE TALKING SO I
IT THE CROWDFUNDING COMMUNITY WE MET RESPONDED TREMENDOUSLY AND WE MANAGED TO RAISE OUR GOAL OF 100000 US DOLLARS WITHIN THE FIRST FOUR HOURS OF OUR LAUNCH TO
WE WANTED TO PUT THE POWER OF CAPTURING THE NIGHT SKIES IN YOUR HANDS AND THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE TO TAKE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ROUTE WE DECIDED TO GO FOR
HE'S A MECHANICAL ENGINEER BY TRAINING BUT HE'S FANTASTIC AT OPERATIONS AND ADVERTISING
AFTER SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER WE REALIZED THAT IT CAN ALL BE SOLVED THROUGH AUTOMATION AND ALL WE REQUIRE IS COMPUTING POWER AND COMPUTING POWER IS ONE
THE PILOT TRAINING COURSE AFTER 15 FLIGHTS OR THEY FAILED IT AFTER THE EIGHTH FLIGHT I FAILED IT ON MY SIXTH FLIGHT WHICH MEANS I FAILED IT ON MY FIFTH FLIGHT AND I FAILED A SECOND REVIEW
HIS STORIES FASCINATED ME BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHY MOST OF MY CLASSMATES WERE NOT THERE WITH ME ON THAT NIGHT AFTER SPEAKING TO THEM I REALIZED THE
AND REALIZE THAT AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE STARS ARE WHAT'S REALLY SPECIAL IS RIGHT HERE FOR WE'RE ALL MADE OF STARDUST THANK YOU
WAS THIS GUY WORKS ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION AND I WANTED TO HAVE SECOND ONE
YOU EVENTUALLY FIND THE RESOURCES TO DO IT WHETHER THROUGH FRIENDS OR WHETHER THROUGH SELF LEARNING
WHEN I WAS AN ART STUDENT IN THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE NOT EXACTLY WHERE
LED ME TO GO AND FIND THE SMARTEST GUY IN SCHOOL TO HELP ME OUT AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND MY CTO MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND LIH WEI
FAILURE IN TRYING TO FLY AND FAILED ON MY SIXTH FLIGHT I WOULD NOT HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO LEARNING
DID IT ON INDIEGOGO WE SPREAD A MESSAGE TO THE CROWDFUNDING COMMUNITY THAT WE WANTED TO BRING ASTRONOMY IMAGING THE POWER OF ASTRONOMY IMAGING AND PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS
I WAS QUITE UPSET HAVING JUST LOST MY DREAM JOB MY COUSIN NOTICED THAT AND SHE SIGNED ME UP FOR A PHOTOGRAPHY
THROUGHOUT ALL THESE THREE YEARS ONE THOUGHT STUCK IN MY HEAD IT WAS THE IDEA SHARED BY STEVE JOBS DURING A CONVOCATION HE WAS SAYING YOU CANNOT CONNECT THE DOTS LOOKING
NATURE HAS GOTTEN SO DISTANT FROM US THAT WHAT'S NATURAL IS NOW BECOMING ALIEN TO
THE LONG ANSWER IS I FAIL AND I FAIL A LOT
BEST ENGINEER I KNOW OF HE ACTUALLY JOINED THE NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGE PROGRAM AND HE BECAME A CTO OF A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR START UP OVER THERE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THERE FOR ONLY A YEAR
EQUIPMENT WAS SO EXPENSIVE THAT A RENTAL ALONE WOULD COST MORE THAN THE WHOLE TINYMOS
THE ARMED FORCES PUT YOU ON COMPULSORY LEAVE I WAS PUT ON 10
BUILD A SECOND ONE BECAUSE EACH OF THESE DEVELOPMENT KITS COSTS TEN TIMES MY DAILY
AND THAT'S HOW WE LEVERAGE ON EACH OTHER STRENGTHS TO COVER FOR OUR BLIND SPOTS
THOSE MISSIONS PUT MEN ON THE MOON IMAGINE HOW MUCH COMPUTING POWER WE HAVE IN OUR PHONES RIGHT NOW
IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT IN THE 1990S IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE WAS BLACKOUT PEOPLE CALLED THE POLICE TO NOTIFY THEM THAT THERE ARE WEIRD CLOUDS HANGING OUT IN THE SKIES {LG} WHAT THEY HAD JUST SEEN WAS THE MILKY WAY
A FAILURE AND TRYING TO BUILD MY FM TRANSMITTER RADIO I WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND MY CTO IF I
ROADS AS TREES
THUS WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE INTRODUCE SENSE WE INTRODUCE STRUCTURE
TO DESCRIBE THE CONTINUUM THE PHYSICAL CONTINUUM OF THE WORLD
AND MY MAIN POINT IS THAT THAT STRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY COMPLEX TO MATCH THE CONTINUUM WE ARE USING AND WHICH IS RELEVANT TO US
I SAID IS GETTING MORE INFLUENTIAL WE CAN CONTROL A LARGER PART OF THE PHYSICAL CONTINUUM EACH DAY JUST THINK ABOUT YOUR MOBILE PHONES
WHICH KIND OF TRUST WHAT KIND OF TRUST IS RATIONAL IN POSTMODERNIST DECISION MAKING THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE TYPES AND ONLY ONE IS
WE HAVE TO STRUCTURE THAT COMPLEXITY BY INTRODUCING
OUR HERE NOW AND I ORIGIN WHICH STRUCTURES INTO A PAST WHICH IS DETERMINED WITH KNOWN OUTCOME
INTO A FUTURE WHICH IS CONTINGENT AND UNDETERMINED
HERE WE STRUCTURE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE HORIZON OF POSSIBILITIES INTO A COUPLE OF OPTIONS
THEN
WE SELECT AN OPTION AND HERE BEGINS THE DILEMMA WHEN WE TRY TO DETERMINE WHEN WE PICK AN OPTION WE TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE WORLD WILL BE LIKE
BIGGER IT'S GETTING BIGGER EACH DAY
THE
FACTS WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE BREAKFAST YOU HAD THIS MORNING FOR SURE IMPACTED
THE LIVES OF
PEOPLE ON THREE DIFFERENT CONTINENTS AT LEAST
THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY CONSEQUENCES PROBLEM I INDIVIDUALLY CAN KNOW LESS WHILE I HAVE STRONGER IMPACT ONTO THE WORLD
WHICH LEADS ME BACK TO THE ALTERNATIVE WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE WHEN YOU HAVE A COMPLEXITY PROBLEM THAT YOU CANNOT REDUCE EXCLUSIVELY ON THE BASIS OF FIGURES
WELL THERE'S TRUST
AS LUHMANN ARGUED IF THE WORLD IS TOO COMPLEX FOR YOU THEN HAVE SOME PART OF THE COMPLEXITY BE PROCESSED BY SOMEBODY ELSE WHOM YOU TRUST
IS RISING IT'S ALSO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTION KARL B HLER HAS PUT US INTO A CENTER WHICH HE CALLED HERE
OF COURSE THAT HORIZON OF POSSIBLE STATES OPENS AGAIN MAYBE WE SEE THAT WE'VE BEEN
AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE EVALUATOR OF OUR DECISIONS
HE EACH DAY ASKS US MORE STRONGLY FOR INDICES QUOTIENTS RATINGS THRESHOLDS WHICH IS OKAY AS LONG AS THEY PERFORM BETTER
AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING THAT IN MANY CASES THEY DO
AND I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT THERE ARE OTHER CASES WHERE THEY DON'T
IT RELATES TO SKILLS AND COMPETENCES AND
AND WHY IS THAT HAPPENING
BECAUSE WHEN WE DECIDE
WE FEEL THE PROBLEM WITH RESPONSIBILITY AND WE TRY TO GET RID OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY WE RANK AN EXCEL TABLE WITH APPLICANTS AND WE SAY I PICKED THE TOPMOST ROW
BECAUSE AT SOME MOMENT WHEN SOMEBODY COMES AND SAYS WHY DID YOU HIRE THAT GUY HE'S BAD
THEN WE CAN SAY NO IT WASN'T ME WHO DECIDED IT WAS THE MATH I ONLY DID THE MATH
BUT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER OPTION WHILE WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS WE CAN NEVER GET BACK TO THE STATE THE WORLD HAD WHEN WE DECIDED
NEW SITUATIONS QUALITATIVELY ENTIRELY NEW SITUATIONS
IN WHICH WE WOULD HAVE TO SET UP A NEW RELEVANCE BASIS WHICH MAYBE WE CAN
BUT WHICH CAN TAKE US MORE TIME
THAN RATIONALLY DELIBERATING
SITUATIONS IN WHERE NORMATIVITY PLAYS CRUCIAL ROLE BECAUSE AS I SAID COMPUTERS DON'T ACT ETHICALLY
INCREASING AND THAT LEADS US RIGHT BACK TO THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY THE FIRST ONE BEING THE QUESTION OF THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY WHAT CAN WE KNOW I ARGUE THAT WE CAN KNOW LESS EACH
THE MAGNET TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM COMING ASSUME WE WERE UNDER NUCLEAR ATTACK BY NORTH KOREA AN EQUIVALENT ANSWER WHAT WOULD IT BE NO WE ONLY
WE HAVE ON THE ONE HAND COMPLEXITY INCREASING AND ON THE OTHER HAND
IS CLAIMED BY AUTHORITIES TRUST ME BECAUSE I'M PROFESSOR OK I'LL TRUST YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE HIGHER IN THE RANKING THAT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL WE SHOULDN'T JUDGE THIS
BECAUSE NUMBERS ARE OBVIOUSLY SO HIGHLY APPEALING TO PERSONS
IF THAT HAPPENS THEN WE'D HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SOCIETAL COHERENCE HAVING ON THE ONE HAND INSTITUTIONS THAT CANNOT DECIDE BECAUSE THEY'RE NO LONGER LEGITIMATED
AND ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING A PUBLIC LEFT ALONE WITH THAT COMPLEXITY CONSEQUENCE PROBLEM
AND THAT'S NOT THE FUTURE WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE
WHATEVER THE WORLD MAY BE PHYSICALLY CONSIDER IT A SPACE OF FLOWS OF ENERGY AND MATTER IT'S FOR SURE A
WE SEE THE BIRTH OF SO CALLED POLITICAL ALTERNATIVES
ROAMING THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT JUST AS THIS BIRD DOES AND WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU
WELL THEY TELL YOU ABOUT COMPLEXITY THAT IT SIMPLY ISN'T THERE
THE SITUATION IS EASY WE ONLY HAVE TO
AND IN WHICH WE FEEL ONLY RATIONAL BY TRUSTING FIGURES AND NOT TRUSTING
AND HE OBSERVES THE TRAJECTORY OF OUR DECISIONS EACH ASSOCIATED
WITH ALTERNATIVES
DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO HE OBSERVES IT AS THE PAST AS THE FINDING AS ALREADY KNOWN
WHILE WE HAD TO JUDGE IT AS AN OPTION AS POSSIBLE CONTINGENT
WHAT WAS IN THE CORE OF THEIR ARGUMENT THEY TOO WERE PRACTICING THE CULT OF THE FIGURES THEY CLAIM THAT IT COULD ALL BE SOLVED BY THRESHOLD AN UPPER LIMIT A NUMBER SAYING OKAY WE LIMIT IT TO 200000 MIGRANTS
YOU NOTHING ABOUT COMPLEXITY WHAT DID YOU DO TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY TO GET TO THAT NUMBER
THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT CONSEQUENCES WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRST 200000
THEY ONLY TOLD YOU SOME STRANGE AND INHUMANE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE 200001ST
WHICH LEADS ME TO THE CONCLUSION OF MY TALK
EACH DAY MORE STRONGLY
BUT WHILE WE'RE ABLE TO USE IT WE'RE NEVER ABLE TO ALTER IT WE CAN USE GRAVITY BUT WE CANNOT CHANGE WHAT GRAVITY IS
AND SINCE WE CANNOT CHANGE WE CANNOT SIMPLIFY AND SINCE WE CANNOT SIMPLIFY THUS MENTAL STRUCTURES MUST BECOME MORE COMPLEX WHICH IS WHY THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR WORLD IS RISING AND THE SECOND POINT IS CRUCIAL
NOT ONLY IS OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE PHYSICAL CONTINUUM IS RISING BUT ALSO IS OUR DESIRE TO DO SO
WE HAVE AN INCREASING NECESSITY FOR SUCH PIECES OF ART FOR NEW ENERGY FOR NEW MATERIALS
AND THE LAST POINT IS HUMAN CONDUCT YES WE CAN PREDICT HUMAN CONDUCT WITH COMPUTERS BUT NOT IN EACH CASE HUMANS
HIGHLIGHTED IN RED ARE THE POINTS WHERE I FEEL THAT FREQUENTLY COMPUTERS CANNOT SOLELY HELP US OR FIGURES CANNOT SOLELY HELP US BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CANNOT SET UP THE POTENTIAL RELEVANCE BASIS THE ACTUAL C
YES BUT THE POTENTIAL POSSIBLY NOT THEY NEED A HUMAN OPERATOR
AND OF COURSE THEY CAN ACT RESPONSIBLY TO ME AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO ETHICS THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO LAW
SO SOMEBODY
SO I SAID TO YOU IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WE NEED A CERTAIN KIND OF TRUST I REALLY HOPE THAT WE WILLL ALL SEE HAPPENING A
TO KEEP KIM JONG UN FROM HITTING US THAT'S NOT WHAT IS HELPFUL IN POSTMODERN PROBLEMS
TO SKILLS AND COMPETENCES NOT TO STATUS NOT TO PERSONALITY NOT TO IDENTITY
THUS IT IS
TRUST OFFERED BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A COMPLEXITY CONSEQUENCE PROBLEM AND LOOK FOR SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP OUT
THAT PERSON NEEDS TO COMMIT HIMSELF TO THE PROBLEM
AND THAT MEANS HE GETS INTO DISCOURSE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE OTHER OPINIONS AND THEY TRY TO DELIBERATE
THEN WE GET INTO PROBLEMS WHEN TAKING DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF NUMBERS AND FIGURES
OF THE BOOKS PUBLISHED OF SCIENTIFIC BOOKS PUBLISHED EACH YEAR THAT YOU CAN READ IT'S DECREASING IT'S GETTING MARGINAL
I'M FULLY CONVINCED THAT THIS COMPLEXITY IS RISING THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT
ENTERING AN AGE OF DISTRUST IN WHICH WE FEEL
FOR 10 DOLLARS OR MORE NOW THIS IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE IDEA AND THE MOLECULES THEY MENTION SOUND REALLY SCIENCE Y
OF THESE ANIMALS PRODUCES TINY QUANTITIES AND IN THE CASE OF THE DOG
MALES DOGS CAN SMELL IT BUT WE CAN'T SMELL IT
AND IT WAS ONLY IN 1959
THAT A GERMAN TEAM
AFTER SPENDING 20 YEARS IN SEARCH OF THESE MOLECULES
DISCOVERED IDENTIFIED
THE FIRST PHEROMONE AND THIS WAS THE SEX PHEROMONE OF A SILK MOTH
NOW THIS WAS AN INSPIRED
SOMETHING NICE TO SMELL BUT GRADUALLY WE LEARN WHAT'S NOT GOOD AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARN AT THE SAME TIME AS WHAT IS NOT GOOD IS WHAT IS
LOOKED FOR PHEROMONES SO EFFECTIVELY IN HUMANS THERE ARE INDEED PROBLEMS AND THE FIRST OF
SO THE ANCIENT GREEKS KNEW THAT DOGS SENT INVISIBLE SIGNALS BETWEEN EACH OTHER A FEMALE DOG IN HEAT SENT AN INVISIBLE SIGNAL TO MALE DOGS FOR MILES AROUND
FORM ALMOST A BADGE OF IDENTITY YOU'RE PART OF THE IN GROUP
THE SECOND THING IS
THE SENSE OF SMELL
EACH OF US HAS A UNIQUE ODOR WORLD IN THE SENSE THAT WHAT WE SMELL WE EACH SMELL A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD
NOW SMELL WAS THE HARDEST OF THE SENSES TO CRACK
AND THE NOBEL PRIZE AWARDED TO RICHARD AXEL AND LINDA BUCK
WAS ONLY AWARDED IN 2004
FOR THEIR DISCOVERY OF HOW SMELL WORKS
IT'S REALLY HARD
BUT IN ESSENCE
NERVES FROM THE BRAIN GO
UP INTO
AND ON THESE NERVES EXPOSED IN THE NOSE TO THE OUTSIDE AIR ARE RECEPTORS
AND ODOR MOLECULES COMING IN ON A SNIFF INTERACT WITH THESE RECEPTORS
AND IF THEY BOND THEY SEND THE NERVE A SIGNAL WHICH GOES BACK INTO THE BRAIN
WE DON'T JUST HAVE ONE KIND OF RECEPTOR
HAVE
THEM MEN AND WOMEN
AND THESE THE LITTLE BUMPS AROUND THE NIPPLE
AND IF YOU'RE A LACTATING WOMAN THESE START TO SECRETE
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SECRETION
WHAT BENOIST SCHAAL AND HIS TEAM DEVELOPED WAS A SIMPLE TEST TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THE EFFECT OF THIS SECRETION MIGHT BE
IN EFFECT A SIMPLE BIOASSAY
FAIRLY CONVINCED THAT WE DO HAVE THEM WE'RE MAMMALS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S A MAMMAL
AND WE PROBABLY DO HAVE THEM
BUT WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO IS GO RIGHT BACK TO THE BEGINNING
AND BASICALLY LOOK ALL OVER THE BODY NO MATTER HOW EMBARRASSING
WE NEED TO SEARCH
AND GO FOR THE FIRST TIME WHERE NO ONE ELSE HAS DARED TREAD
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IT'S GOING TO BE EMBARRASSING BUT WE NEED TO LOOK
WE ALSO NEED TO GO BACK TO THE IDEAS THAT BUTENANDT USED WHEN HE WAS STUDYING THE SILK MOTH
SMELL CORIANDER OR CILANTRO THAT HERB EITHER AS SOMETHING DELICIOUS AND SAVORY OR SOMETHING LIKE SOAP SO WE EACH HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WORLD OF SMELL AND THAT COMPLICATES ANYTHING WHEN WE'RE STUDYING
THIS IS FROM ANY MOTHER IT COULD REALLY BE A PHEROMONE IT'S NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION ANY MOTHER WILL DO NOW WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT APART FROM BEING SIMPLY VERY INTERESTING
IT VERY CAREFULLY HE SYNTHESIZED THE MOLECULE
AND THEN TRIED THE SYNTHESIZED MOLECULE ON THE MALES AND GOT THEM
TO RESPOND AND SHOWED IT WAS INDEED THAT MOLECULE
THAT'S CLOSING THE CIRCLE
THAT'S THE THING WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DONE WITH HUMANS NOTHING SYSTEMATIC NO REAL DEMONSTRATION
WITH THAT NEW CONCEPT WE NEEDED A NEW
ADOLF BUTENANDT AND HIS TEAM
BECAUSE HE NEEDED HALF A MILLION MOTHS TO GET ENOUGH MATERIAL TO DO THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
BUT HE CREATED THE MODEL FOR HOW YOU SHOULD GO ABOUT PHEROMONE ANALYSIS
HE BASICALLY WENT THROUGH SYSTEMATICALLY SHOWING THAT ONLY THE MOLECULE IN QUESTION WAS THE ONE THAT STIMULATED THE MALES NOT ALL THE OTHERS
HE
IS A VERY POWERFUL WORD IT CONJURES UP SEX
PRIMATES HAVE SCENT GLANDS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY
THE GREAT APES HAVE THESE ARMPITS FULL OF SECRETORY GLANDS PRODUCING SMELLS
ALL THE TIME
ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF MOLECULES
WHEN THEY'RE SECRETED FROM THE GLANDS THE MOLECULES ARE ODORLESS THEY HAVE NO SMELL AT ALL AND IT'S ONLY THE WONDERFUL BACTERIA
GROWING ON THE RAINFOREST OF HAIR THAT ACTUALLY PRODUCES THE SMELLS THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE
AND SO INCIDENTALLY IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SMELL
CLEAR CUTTING YOUR ARMPITS IS VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING THE HABITAT FOR BACTERIA AND YOU'LL FIND THEY REMAIN LESS SMELLY FOR MUCH LONGER
BUT ALTHOUGH WE'VE FOCUSED ON ARMPITS I THINK IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE THE LEAST EMBARRASSING PLACE TO GO AND ASK PEOPLE FOR SAMPLES
THERE IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER REASON WHY WE MIGHT NOT BE LOOKING FOR A UNIVERSAL SEX PHEROMONE THERE
AND THAT'S BECAUSE 20 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION
DOESN'T HAVE SMELLY ARMPITS LIKE ME
STILL YOU'LL FIND WEBSITES THAT OFFER THIS AS A MAJOR QUIRK
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH WE SPEND ABOUT AS MUCH MONEY TAKING THE SMELLS OFF US
AS PUTTING THEM BACK ON IN PERFUMES
AND PERFUMES ARE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THE REST OF THIS TALK
IS
TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT PHEROMONES REALLY ARE
TELL YOU WHY I THINK WE WOULD EXPECT
HUMANS TO HAVE PHEROMONES
WE GO TO ANY MOTHER WHO IS SECRETING FROM THE AREOLAR GLANDS SO IT'S NOT ABOUT RECOGNITION IT CAN BE FROM ANY MOTHER IF WE TAKE THE SECRETION AND NOW PUT IT UNDER THE BABY'S
IF YOU DON'T GET IT
YOU WON'T SURVIVE YOU'LL BE DEAD
SINCE MANY BABIES ACTUALLY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO TAKE THAT FIRST MEAL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT STIMULUS
IF WE COULD IDENTIFY WHAT THAT MOLECULE WAS
AND THE FRENCH TEAM ARE BEING VERY CAUTIOUS BUT IF WE COULD IDENTIFY THE MOLECULE
SYNTHESIZE IT IT WOULD THEN MEAN PREMATURE BABIES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO SUCKLE
AND EVERY BABY WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL
SO WHAT I WANT TO ARGUE IS THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF WHERE A SYSTEMATIC
REALLY SCIENTIFIC APPROACH CAN ACTUALLY BRING YOU A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF PHEROMONES THERE COULD BE ALL SORTS OF MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS THERE COULD BE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HUMANS ARE DOING WITH PHEROMONES THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW AT THE MOMENT
WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS PHEROMONES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SEX THEY'RE ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO DO WITH A MAMMAL'S LIFE
SO DO GO FORWARD AND DO SEARCH FOR MORE THERE'S LOTS TO FIND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ANIMALS IN FEMALE ANIMALS IT WORKS JUST AS WELL UNDERWATER FOR GOLDFISH AND LOBSTERS
AND ALMOST EVERY MAMMAL YOU CAN THINK OF HAS HAD A PHEROMONE IDENTIFIED
AND OF COURSE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF INSECTS
SO WE KNOW THAT PHEROMONES EXIST RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
WHAT ABOUT HUMANS
WELL THE FIRST THING OF COURSE IS THAT WE'RE MAMMALS AND MAMMALS SMELLY
AS ANY DOG OWNER CAN TELL YOU
WE SMELL THEY SMELL
BUT THE REAL REASON WE MIGHT THINK THAT HUMANS HAVE PHEROMONES
IS THE CHANGE THAT OCCURS AS WE GROW UP
THE SMELL OF A ROOM OF TEENAGERS IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE SMELL OF A ROOM OF SMALL CHILDREN
WHAT'S CHANGED AND OF COURSE IT'S PUBERTY
ALONG WITH THE PUBIC HAIR AND THE HAIR IN THE ARMPITS
NEW GLANDS START TO SECRETE IN THOSE PLACES
AND THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THE CHANGE IN SMELL
AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH WHITE LAB COATS YOU MUST IMAGINE THAT THERE IS FANTASTIC SCIENCE BEHIND THIS
BUT SADLY
THESE ARE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS
SUPPORTED BY DODGY SCIENCE
THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY GOOD SCIENTISTS WORKING ON WHAT THEY THINK ARE HUMAN PHEROMONES
AND THEY'RE PUBLISHING IN RESPECTABLE JOURNALS
AT THE BASIS OF THIS DESPITE VERY SOPHISTICATED EXPERIMENTS
THERE REALLY IS NO GOOD SCIENCE BEHIND IT BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A PROBLEM
WHICH IS
NOBODY HAS SYSTEMATICALLY GONE THROUGH ALL THE ODORS THAT HUMANS PRODUCE AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MOLECULES THAT WE GIVE OFF
WE'RE MAMMALS WE PRODUCE A LOT OF SMELL
NOW INDIA IS A COUNTRY INFAMOUS FOR ITS SCORCHING HEAT AND HUMIDITY FOR ME THE ONLY RELIEF FROM THIS HEAT IS TO DRINK PLENTY OF WATER
I WANTED TO KNOW WHY THESE KIDS LACKED WATER A SUBSTANCE THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE AND I LEARNED THAT WE ARE FACING A GLOBAL WATER CRISIS
SEE WATER ISN'T JUST THE UNIVERSAL SOLVENT WATER IS A UNIVERSAL HUMAN
THE UV RADIATION FROM THE SUN DESTROYS THE DNA OF THESE HARMFUL PATHOGENS AND DECONTAMINATES THE WATER
I LEARNED THAT CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SOMETHING CALLED SOLAR DISINFECTION OR SODIS IS USED TO PURIFY WATER
I DIDN'T LET MY AGE DETER ME IN MY INTEREST IN PURSUING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND WANTING TO SOLVE THE GLOBAL WATER
WATCHING THESE KIDS FORCED TO DRINK WATER THAT I FELT WAS TOO DIRTY TO TOUCH CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD
REALLY SLOW AS IT CAN TAKE UP TO TWO DAYS WHEN IT'S CLOUDY SO IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SODIS PROCESS FASTER THIS NEW METHOD CALLED PHOTOCATALYSIS HAS RECENTLY BEEN USED
WHILE TIO2 IS SAFE AND INERT IT'S REALLY INEFFICIENT
JUST AS WATER DROPS COME TOGETHER TO FORM OCEANS I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL MUST COME TOGETHER WHEN TACKLING THIS GLOBAL PROBLEM THANK YOU
BUT PHOTOCATALYSTS LIKE TITANIUM DIOXIDE ARE ACTUALLY COMMONLY USED IN SUNSCREENS TO BLOCK UV RADIATION SO WHEN THEY'RE COATED ON THE INSIDE OF THESE BOTTLES THEY'RE ACTUALLY BLOCKING SOME OF THE UV
IS DOING IS IT'S JUST SPEEDING UP THIS SOLAR DISINFECTION PROCESS
SO MY GOAL WAS TO OVERCOME THE DISADVANTAGES OF THESE CURRENT TREATMENT METHODS AND CREATE A SAFE SUSTAINABLE COST EFFECTIVE AND ECO FRIENDLY METHOD OF PURIFYING WATER
SO AFTER RETURNING HOME ONE SUMMER IN EIGHTH GRADE I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO COMBINE MY PASSION FOR SOLVING THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS WITH MY INTEREST IN SCIENCE
LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF EARTH'S FRESHWATER SUPPLY IS AVAILABLE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
ALONE A SINGLE DROP OF WATER CAN'T DO MUCH BUT WHEN MANY DROPS COME TOGETHER THEY CAN SUSTAIN LIFE ON OUR PLANET
SUMMER MY FAMILY AND I TRAVEL ACROSS THE WORLD 3000 MILES AWAY TO THE CULTURALLY DIVERSE COUNTRY OF INDIA
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES TO THE WAY PHOTOCATALYTIC SODIS IS CURRENTLY DEPLOYED
HOWEVER I SOON REALIZED THAT NOT EVERYONE IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE CLEAN WATER WE DID
CAN EVEN COAT THE INSIDE OF AN EXISTING WATER TANK TO PURIFY LARGER AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR COMMUNITIES OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME
DRINKING THE CATALYST BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO REPLENISH IT EVEN AFTER A FEW USES
THE COMPOSITE COMBINES TITANIUM DIOXIDE WITH CEMENT THE CEMENT LIKE COMPOSITE CAN BE FORMED INTO SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHAPES WHICH RESULTS IN AN EXTREMELY VERSATILE RANGE OF DEPLOYMENT METHODS
SO I DECIDED THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO CONVERT MY GARAGE INTO A LABORATORY
IN INDIA THE WATER IS OFTEN CONTAMINATED SO MY PARENTS HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATER WE DRINK IS SAFE
I HAVE A FEAR THAT IN THE DRIVE TO MOVE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FORWARD
WE'RE BEING TOO COMPLICATED
THERE ARE TOO MANY SYSTEMS TOO MANY STRUCTURES TOO MANY POLICYMAKERS IN POLITICS MAKING NEW
AND YOU KNOW WHAT GIVEN THE POWER
SITTING DOING REGISTRATION
ON THE FRIDAY MORNING
AND THE KIDS CAME UP TO MY DESK WHEN THEIR NAME WAS CALLED AND THEY PUT FEW PENNIES IN A TIN
AND IT GOT TO GARY AND HE DIDN'T PUT FEW PENNIES IN THE TIN
HE CAME UP TO MY DESK
AND THERE WAS A THUD ON MY TABLE
TIGHT
I WAS FINDING IT HARD TO SHARE MY EMOTIONS AND BECAUSE HIS OTHER PASSION AS WELL AS ENGLISH AND LITERATURE WAS DRAMA
HE DECIDED
HAVING SPENT TIME WITH ME
THAT MAYBE THE BEST THING FOR ME WOULD BE TO TRY
ON YOUR LIFE ANYWAY HE DIDN'T SAY ME SO I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM AGAIN
THINGS TOO LIKE WETTING MY BED SO YOU CAN IMAGINE EMOTIONALLY I WAS NOT IN A GREAT PLACE AND MOST
UNIFORM WERE ALLOWED TO COME IN ON FRIDAY IN THEIR OWN CLOTHES BUT THEY HAD TO PAY FOR THE RIGHT
WAS THAT HE SUFFERED FROM SEVERE DYSPRAXIA AND AS A RESULT LIKE A LOT OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE
BUT TO ME HE IS THE ULTIMATE CITIZEN OF THE 21ST CENTURY HIS BEHAVIORS HIS SKILLS HIS OUTLOOK ON LIFE
ARE ALL WHAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR STUDENTS IF WE ARE TRULY TO CREATE A FUTURE WHICH IS POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER GARY'S STORY
AND TO THINK TO YOURSELF THAT NO MATTER WHAT COMPLEXITIES YOU DEAL WITH OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEK MONTHS AND YEARS
WHAT YOU DO IS COMMIT YOURSELVES TO MAKING SURE
THAT YOU FIND THE GARY
IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS
THANK YOU SO MUCH
I'M AN EGOTIST AND I'M SAT
AMONGST ALL OF THE COMPLEXITY AND ALL OF THE NEW CHALLENGES IS TO REMEMBER THAT AT THE CORE OF EDUCATION IS HUMANITY AS
MY MILD STAMMER DISAPPEARED AND NOW I'M ABLE TO STAND IN FRONT OF YOU HERE TODAY NOW DAVID WAS A
ABOVE ALL THINGS AS TEACHERS AND AS EDUCATORS
THE MONEY AND DO YOU KNOW THAT WAY WHEN A CHILD IS ABOUT TO HAVE A TEMPER TANTRUM
I HAD A NEW BOOK COMING OUT
SO IN THE END I DECIDED TO DEDICATE MY BOOK TO HIM
AND IN THE BOOK I SAY THIS
THANK YOU DAVID FOR CHANGING THE WAY I VIEWED MY WORLD
FOREVER
TWO THOUGHTS
ONE
THE TEACHER YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT JUST NOW WHEN I ASKED YOU
IF THEY'RE STILL ALIVE
LEAVE HERE AT THE END OF TODAY
FIND A WAY TO CONTACT THEM AND FIND A WAY TO THANK
ANYWAY WE ARRANGED TO MEET AND THEN I HEARD NOTHING AND THIS WORRIED ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WHEN I GOT TO THE AIRPORT IN LONDON TO FLY OUT TO AUSTRALIA WE STILL HADN'T PHONED UP OUR ARRANGEMENTS AND IT TURNS OUT WHILE I WAS SAT THERE AT THE
THAT I'VE LEARNED FAR MORE FROM THE STUDENTS I'VE HAD THE
SUBJECTS WERE AT SCHOOL AND THEN YOU ASK MORE QUESTIONS WHAT YOU FIND ACTUALLY IS IT WASN'T THE SUBJECT THEY LOVED FIRST IT WAS THE TEACHER
NOW AND SO HE'S BEEN SAVING FOR A NEW ONE HE'S BEEN SAVING HIS MONEY FROM BIRTHDAY AND FROM CHRISTMAS AND HE'S BEEN GOING
TRUE AND MY WIFE SAID YES ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE SHE KNEW GARY TOO ANYWAY AS A RESULT OF THAT PHONE CALL GARY AND I ARRANGED TO
THAT WHEN YOU WERE IN THEIR COMPANY WHEN YOU WERE IN THEIR CLASSROOM THEY MADE YOU FEEL AS IF YOU COULD FLY THEY MADE YOU WANT TO GO BACK TIME AND TIME AGAIN ISN'T IT
HE SAID BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT SPORTS AND HE SAID I DECIDED BY THE TIME I WAS 16 I WANTED TO
WOULD HAVE ASKED YOUR GARIES SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
USD 150 NOW THIS
WAS CHILD
IN SOCIALLY DEPRIVED COMMUNITY
IN A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
AND THIS IS WELL OVER 20 YEARS AGO
SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE VALUE OF THAT MONEY TODAY
WELL I SAID TO HIM
TO AND HE WAS THAT CHILD FOR ME AND SOMETHING
MAN I'M NOT AN INTELLECTUAL I'M NOT AN ACADEMIC
TAKE THE PROFITS FROM MY COMPANY EVERY DECEMBER I'VE BUILT A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN EMERGING TRIBE IN WESTERN AFRICA AND I GO OVER THERE IN DECEMBER I FUND MYSELF AND I HELP THEM TO LEARN TO DO WHAT I DO
SO BY NOW I'M CRYING WITH PRIDE I'M
HOW HE GOT THE MONEY SHE SAID IN MY HOUSE I HAVE ALWAYS TAUGHT MY
YOU AND MOST STUDENTS YOU NEVER THINK YOU'LL SEE AGAIN AND THIS WAS THE CASE WITH GARY BUT I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS TAUGHT A GARY AND WHEN YOU'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TEACHING A GARY
A COUPLE OF MONTHS EARLIER HE WASN'T AN OLD MAN I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
THIS TIME I DIDN'T SEND MY APPLICATION IN I GOT MY MOM TO DRIVE ME TO THE COLLEGE AND I SAID I WANT TO SEE THE ADMISSIONS TUTOR PLEASE
HE'S AN 18 YEAR OLD BOY BY NOW I'VE GOT PRIDE I SAID SO WHAT
NIGHT HE WAS CRYING WITH ME OVER THE DINNER TABLE PLEADING WITH ME TO ALLOW HIM TO GIVE HIS MONEY OVER AND HE SAID THIS AND SHE
ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE
SHE SAID HE SAID THIS MOMMY
PLEASE
DON'T
MAKE ME USE THAT MONEY TO BUY A BICYCLE
I WILL NEVER ENJOY RIDING IT
KNOWING WHERE THE MONEY
AS WE MARCH INTO THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD
AND IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK
THAT THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD FOR SOME OF OUR CHILDREN
DOESN'T MEAN LIVING IN THE 21ST CENTURY
IT WILL MEAN LIVING
IN THE 22ND CENTURY
AND HE WAS RAISING MONEY TO BUILD AN ORPHANAGE IN ROMANIA
FOR THOSE CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN EXPOSED DO YOU REMEMBER AT THE END OF THE 80S THE TREATMENT OF ORPHANS IN ROMANIA HE WAS BUILDING THIS INCREDIBLE COMPLEX AND HE CAME IN AND HE SPOKE TO THE CHILDREN AND THE STAFF
AND THE WEEK WAS SET ASIDE THEN FOR RAISING MONEY FOR
IS OUR PRIMARY JOB OUR JOB IS TO CHANGE THE WAY OUR STUDENTS SEE THEIR WORLD SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE IT TO THEIR POTENTIAL NOT TO THE POTENTIAL THAT POLICYMAKERS
GARY
AS BEING A KEY MOTIVATION
FOR WHY I BELIEVED EDUCATION HAD TO BE DIFFERENT
AND MY WIFE WHO'S A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL
GOT A PHONE CALL FROM A COLLEAGUE OF HERS JUST DOWN THE ROAD
AND THIS COLLEAGUE
AND HE'S BEEN SAVING HIS MONEY AND THAT'S HOW THE MONEY
HE SAID I DECIDED TO BECOME A PERSONAL FITNESS TRAINER SPECIALIZING IN WORKING WITH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT TRUST ME MR GERVER HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING SHE SAID I'VE BEEN ARGUING WITH HIM ALL WEEK BUT HE WAS SO MOVED BY THIS PRESENTATION AND THIS
HE HAD A WHOLE RANGE OF SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS
HE WAS A CHILD THAT WHEN HE WAS HANDED OVER TO ME AS PART OF MY FIRST CLASS I WAS SO EXCITED
MY FIRST CLASS OF STUDENTS DO
YOU REMEMBER YOUR FIRST CLASS OF STUDENTS
IT'S FUNNY ISN'T IT THE
MY BROTHER AND I WERE AT THE HEART OF THIS DIVORCE AND IT AFFECTED US BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND ONE OF THE
THIS THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE SYSTEMS AND
NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I DON'T KNOW MANY ADULTS WHO ARE THAT PHILANTHROPIC LET ALONE NINE YEAR OLD
LOST I SAID SOMETHING LIKE I TRIED AND I MADE IT SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUT
PEOPLE INCLUDING MY MOTHER SAID I WAS CRAZY
ONE DAY YOU WILL WATCH THIS ON THE INTERNET I SAY TO YOU TRUST YOURSELF AND BELIEVE WHATEVER HAPPENS DON'T GIVE UP THANK
LIKE ME TO THE AFRICANS AND THE POOR WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH YOUR DREAMS GOD BLESS
PASSES THROUGH OUR BODIES WE DROP DOWN TO NOTHING
WELL I'M HERE TODAY NOT ONLY TO MAKE A CASE FOR DOWN SYNDROME BUT TO SPREAD THE IDEA THAT ALL LIVES MATTER
FAMILIES WERE SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR THEIR CHILDREN BORN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES GETTING INTO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS WASN'T AN OPTION AT THAT TIME SO THEY FIXED THAT
HEAR IT
AND IT HURTS
IT HAS NO PLACE IN OUR WORLD
SO HELP ME ON THIS ONE PLEASE
FINALLY I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS ONE IDEA
EVERY LIFE HAS VALUE
EVERY LIFE MATTERS
REFLECTS THE PAST AND IGNORES THE PRESENT
IMAGINE THAT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
HERE WE ARE REVERSING THE DAMAGE OF LIFE IN INSTITUTIONS
REMOVING BARRIERS TO EDUCATION
MAKING INROADS INTO A FULL AND INCLUSIVE LIFE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME
AND WE HAVE THOSE WHO SAY
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE BORN AT ALL
YOU KNOW MY FIFTH GRADE TEACHER
NAMED HER BABY MIA ROSE
WELL AS WE TURNED THE CORNER ON THE 21ST CENTURY
SOMETHING ELSE WAS HAPPENING TOO
WHILE WE WERE ALL BUSY WRITING NEW CHAPTERS ON DOWN SYNDROME
IT SEEMS THE WHOLE INDUSTRY HAS GROWN UP
AND THE RACE IS ON TO FIND NEWER FASTER WAYS TO TEST FOR DOWN SYNDROME BEFORE BIRTH
THE PROBLEM IS WITHOUT TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL OUR PROGRESS
IF A TEST SHOWS AN EXTRA CHROMOSOME
PREGNANCIES ARE BEING TERMINATED
EXCEPT FOR THOSE LIKE MY FIFTH GRADE TEACHER WHO SAY
I KNOW A DIFFERENT DOWN SYNDROME
NOW BEFORE I CLOSE I HAVE ONE REQUEST TO MAKE OF ALL OF YOU HERE AND ANYONE WATCHING THIS PLEASE TURN YOUR BACK ON THE R
BECAUSE FAMILIES STARTED PUSHING BACK ON THE PRACTICE
IT STILL TOOK A WHILE FOR SOME HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO CATCH ON TO THAT THOUGH
I'VE HEARD MY DAD TALK ABOUT THE DOCTOR DISCUSSING THIS OPTION WITH HIM WHEN I WAS BORN
THE DOCTOR PREDICTED
THAT WOULD BE LUCKY TO BE ABLE
TO
TIE MY OWN SHOES OR WRITE MY OWN NAME
WELL HE FORGOT TO MENTION THE PART ABOUT THE ENGLISH CHANNEL THOUGH
MIA IS EIGHT YEARS OLD NOW SHE'S GOING TO HER NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL SHE'S SPEAKING BOTH ENGLISH AND GERMAN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY MIA IS A SWIMMER {LG}
OUR WORLD IS BETTER WITH MIA IN IT I BELIEVE DOWN SYNDROME IS A LIFE WORTH SAYING YES TO IT IS A LIFE WORTH SAVING
AND 70S
WHO SAID NO TO THE INSTITUTIONS
AND YES TO EDUCATION AND INCLUSION
THESE ORGANIZATIONS KNOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR US IN THE FUTURE
BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS WE ARE MAKING NOW
WE OWE THEM A GREAT DEAL OF THANKS
SO THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY
THE PRESENT
AS WE TURN THE CORNER INTO THE 21ST CENTURY
WE HAVE BEGUN TO SEE MORE AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
GRADUATING FROM THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS
SOME GOING ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION
LEARNING EMPLOYABLE JOB SKILLS
NOW JUST SO YOU KNOW IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT
BREAKTHROUGHS HAVEN'T COME FOR EVERYONE
WE STILL HAVE BATTLES TO FIGHT FOR INCLUSION
IN TOO MANY CLASSROOMS AROUND THE COUNTRY
UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL A HUGE HURDLE FOR US
BUT THOSE GRASSROOTS FAMILY DRIVEN ORGANIZATIONS ARE HARD AT WORK
COLLABORATING
LOBBYING AND DRIVING FOR IMPROVEMENT
60S AND 70S WE HAD PARENTS ORDINARY PARENTS AND OTHER FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS THEY COULD ENLIST
I WONDER WHAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF OUR TOMORROWS THE TOMORROWS OF PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME SOME OF YOU MAY BE THINKING IS THERE A TOMORROW FOR PEOPLE LIKE US
GAVE US THE ABILITY TO LIVE
LEARN AND GROW ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE
IS LEADING THE CHARGE
TO DO JUST THAT
SAVE OUR LIVES
THE GLOBAL DOWN SYNDROME FOUNDATION WAS STARTED ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO
I HAVE 47
AND SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE LIKE ME
IT IS NOT A DISEASE
YOU CAN'T CATCH IT FROM ANYONE
IT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
AND AS OF TODAY WE
REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAPPENS
WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS EXTRA CHROMOSOME ONLY ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO
A RESEARCH TEAM LED BY DR J R ME LEJEUNE MADE THE DISCOVERY
THAT ALL OF US WITH DOWN SYNDROME
ROCK AN EXTRA CHROMOSOME
DR LEJEUNE DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO FINDING WAYS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE OF US
WHO WERE BORN WITH THE EXTRA CHROMOSOME
IT WAS NEVER HIS INTENTION TO HAVE HIS DISCOVERIES LEAD TO THE TEST
THAT WOULD PREVENT OUR LIVES
WELL YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK BACK ABOUT 50 YEARS TO SEE THE PROOF OF THAT
FOR THOSE OF US WITH DOWN SYNDROME
LOOK HOW THEY CHANGED OUR WORLD AND ARE STILL CHANGING IT
CAN'T YOU JUST IMAGINE A FUTURE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME
SPEECH PROBLEMS
OUR MEMORY PROBLEMS
AS WELL AS THE HUGE THREAT MANY OF US FACE
AND THAT IS THE EARLY ONSET OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE CHANGING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THOSE OF US WITH DOWN SYNDROME
AND THEY HOLD THE KEYS TO OUR FUTURE
YOU KNOW MARGARET MEAD ONCE SAID NEVER DOUBT
ALL ROLE MODELS FOR WHAT CAN BE DONE IN SPITE OF ONE EXTRA CHROMOSOME ALL DOING OUR PART TO REWRITE THE STORY ON
BECAUSE SHE KNEW I WANTED TO LEARN AND SHE WANTED TO TEACH
WE STAYED IN TOUCH ALL THESE YEARS
EVEN AFTER SHE GOT MARRIED AND MOVED TO GERMANY
SHE ALWAYS MADE TIME FOR ME WHEN SHE CAME BACK TO THE STATES
A FEW YEARS AGO
I GOT A SPECIAL LETTER FROM HER
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS PREGNANT
AND SHE NEEDED MY HELP
SHE NEEDED MY HELP
BECAUSE HER BABY WOULD BE BORN WITH DOWN SYNDROME
THE DIAGNOSIS CAME VERY EARLY IN HER PREGNANCY
SHE PUSHED BACK ON ANY DISCUSSION OF TERMINATION
BECAUSE SHE KNEW DOWN SYNDROME FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN
HER DOCTOR DID
SHE TAUGHT HIM
ABOUT ONE OF HER FIFTH GRADE STUDENTS
ME
SO WHAT IS DOWN SYNDROME ANYWAY WELL
LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASSES WHERE YOU LEARNED ABOUT CHROMOSOMES
COUNTLESS TIMES HOW DO YOU GET INVOLVED IN FIELD THAT FOCUSES ON THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST
IN FACT FOR ALL OF THESE CRIMES LESS THAN HALF OF INSTANCES ARE REPORTED TO THE POLICE SIMILARLY LESS THAN HALF OF THESE VICTIMS SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP FROM A TRAINED VICTIM ADVOCATE OR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL
INSTEAD IF A VICTIM TELLS ANYONE ABOUT THEIR ABUSE OR ASSAULT IT IS USUALLY SOMEONE THEY ARE CLOSE TO
A SIBLING A FRIEND A ROOMMATE
SO DESPITE THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN CRISIS CENTERS AND SHELTERS AND PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICES
REGULAR PEOPLE
NON PROFESSIONALS
PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS RIGHT NOW ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE IN HELPING PEOPLE TO HEAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA
THERE'S A GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH ON THIS THAT COMES FROM DR REBECCA CAMPBELL
SHE FOUND THAT ONE OF THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF SOMEBODY BEING ABLE TO HEAL AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IS THE CARE THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THE FIRST PERSON THAT THEY TELL
IF THE VICTIM IS CARED FOR AND SUPPORTED THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO SHOW SYMPTOMS OF PTSD AND
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP OR LEGAL COUNSEL
AS A CULTURE WE NEED TO BROADEN THIS PERSONAL LEVEL OF SUPPORT
WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO ALL SURVIVORS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THEIR LIFE THAT CARE IT SHOULD BE EMPOWERING FOR US TO KNOW THAT SIMPLY BY BEING SUPPORTIVE WE CAN HELP TO REVERSE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF
TRAUMA BUT PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF SUPPORT NOT ONLY HELPS PEOPLE TO HEAL FROM PREVIOUS ACTS OF VIOLENCE IT CAN ACTUALLY PREVENT FURTHER VICTIMIZATION SADLY ONE OF THE BEST PREDICTORS OF SOMEBODY BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IS HAVING A PRIOR HISTORY OF VICTIMIZATION
EACH ACT OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT REOCCURRING ONE FACTOR THAT POWERFULLY
MITIGATES THIS CYCLE IS THE RECEIVING OF PROPER CARE AND SUPPORT
IF THE SURVIVOR IS CARED FOR THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE RE VICTIMIZED
SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO BE PRESENT FOR SURVIVORS WE ARE LITERALLY KEEPING THEM SAFER GOING FORWARD
AND ONE FINAL BENEFIT TO THIS APPROACH IS WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER
WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE EVERY INSTANCE OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE IS REPORTED TO THE POLICE
BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE WHY DON'T MORE SURVIVORS REPORT
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHAT CAN WE DO TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY ARE MORE COMFORTABLE DOING SO
SURVIVORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT THEIR CRIME TO THE POLICE IF THEY FEEL BELIEVED AND SUPPORTED BY THOSE WHOM THEY ARE CLOSE TO
EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE BEST STRATEGY FOR INCREASING REPORTING RATES
IS NOT TELLING THE VICTIM THAT THEY MUST GO TO THE POLICE
IT IS PROVIDING THEM WITH LOVE AND SUPPORT SO THEY HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO SO OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE ARE ABLE TO BE PRESENT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND
THAN 4 IS IT
MORE THAN 6
THE REALITY IS EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WILL HAVE SOMEBODY IN THEIR LIFE THAT EITHER HAS OR WILL BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THIS PROBLEM SO EARLIER I POSED THE QUESTION HOW DO WE ENGAGE MORE MAN IN THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS LET'S START SMALL
LET'S START WITH DAY TO DAY THINGS LET'S START BY MAKING IT CLEAR TO THE WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DO CARE ABOUT
I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE REGARDLESS OF GENDER
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MORE OF A CHALLENGE FOR MEN SO AS I POSED THESE QUESTIONS I'M POSING THEM FOR EVERYONE
BUT I WANT THE MEN THAT ARE LISTENING TO PAY ESPECIALLY CLOSE ATTENTION DO
YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE WOMEN THAT YOU CARE ABOUT SEE YOU AS AN ALLY IN THE CAUSE TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN WHEN IT COMES UP HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT RAPE WHEN IT COMES UP
HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHEN THERE'S A HIGH PROFILE CASE IN THE NEWS OR IN OUR POPULAR CULTURE DO
YOU EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS ABOUT THIS CASE
AND IF SO HOW DO YOU DO IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT VICTIM BLAMING' IS DO YOU KNOW WHAT RAPE MYTHS' ARE DO YOU
MAKE IT AN EFFORT TO AVOID ENDORSING THESE IDEAS AND IN THE MOST GENERAL OF TERMS WHAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE DO YOU USE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WOMEN WHAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE DO YOU USE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GENDER AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MEN DO YOU AUTOMATICALLY BECOME DEFENSIVE WHEN YOU HEAR DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN DO YOU AUTOMATICALLY BECOME DEFENSIVE WHEN YOU HEAR DISCUSSIONS AROUND MALE PRIVILEGE
IF SO HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT HOW THIS COMES ACCROSS TO THE WOMEN THAT YOU CARE ABOUT AND LASTLY DO PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU AND SAY THIS IS SOMEBODY I CAN SHARE MY STORY WITH
WITHOUT FEELING JUDGED OR BLAMED
THIS IS SOMEBODY WITH WHOM I CAN SHARE MY STORY AND FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL LISTEN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT
EARLIER WHEN I TALKED ABOUT ENGAGING MEN IN THIS CAUSE I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT GROWING THE RANKS OF MALE RESEARCHERS AND POLICY EXPERTS AND CLINICIANS
I BELIEVE THAT ENGAGING MEN IN THIS FIGHT CAN BEGIN BY ENCOURAGING THEM TO BE BETTER ALLIES AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN THE LIVES OF WOMEN THAT THEY ARE CLOSE TO AND
INSTEAD WHAT IS SUGGESTED IS OFFERING SOME SIMPLE WORDS OF COMPASSION AND ENCOURAGEMENT SOME VERY BASIC THINGS THAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE
HAVE TO BE A TRAINED PSYCHOLOGIST TO EFFECTIVELY
RESPOND TO A DISCLOSURE OF ABUSE OR ASSAULT
ANYBODY CAN BE A GOOD LISTENER
ANYBODY CAN PATIENTLY OFFER SUPPORT
IN GENERAL
TRY TO AVOID TELLING A PERSON WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO
CURRENTLY THERE ARE 20 RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS THAT ARE PART OF PREVENTION INNOVATIONS' AND OF THE 20 I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO IDENTITIES AS
MALE 2 OR 3 TIMES A YEAR I ATTEND NATIONAL CONFERENCES RELATED TO THIS TOPIC
AND THE GENDER SPLIT AT THESE CONFERENCES IS SIMILARLY SKEWED THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REMARKABLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FIELD IN THE RECENT YEARS THAT HAVE COME FROM MEN BUT THE MAJORITY OF RESEARCHERS PRACTITIONERS AND POLICY EXPERTS WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ARE WOMEN AS A
MAN WORKING IN THIS FIELD I TAKE IT AS GIVEN THAT I WILL BE IN THE MINORITY BUT WHEN WE COMPARE THIS TO OTHER ISSUES OF SOCIAL CONCERN WE CAN SEE HOW UNIQUE THIS IS
THERE ARE VERY FEW OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE THIS THAT ARE BEING TACKLED
TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO HOW I TALKED ABOUT THESE ISSUES WHEN THEY CAME UP
I BECAME MORE CONSCIENCIOUS OF MY OWN PERSONAL HISTORY OF MALE PRIVILEGE
AND I BECAME MORE AWARE OF HOW I WAS COMING ACROSS TO OTHER PEOPLE
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE KNEW THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT I CARED ABOUT AND THAT I TOOK SERIOUSLY SHORTLY AFTER I BECAME MORE VIGILANT ABOUT THIS SOMETHING INTERESTING BEGAN TO HAPPEN
VARIOUS WOMEN THAT I KNOW BEGAN TO SHARE WITH ME THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF ABUSE AND ASSAULT SOMEONE SHARED WITH ME A STORY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THEY ENDURED AT WORK ANOTHER WOMAN DISCLOSED THAT SHE'D BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WHILE IN COLLEGE AND SHE WAS STILL STRUGGLING WITH SYMPTOMS OF PTSD AND
ONE PERSON WHO I'D KNOWN FOR YEARS BEGAN TO REGULARLY OPEN UP TO ME ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD
NONE OF THESE DISCLOSURES WERE THE RESULT OF PRYING OR PROMPTING
I HONESTLTY BELIEVE THAT SURVIVORS ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A WAY TO SHARE THEIR STORY AND I PRESENTED MYSELF AS SOMEBODY WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN IN A WAY MY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ALLOWED ME TO CARE ABOUT THIS MORE IN MY PERSONAL LIFE
AND IN TURN MY PERSONAL LIFE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES DEEPENED MY DESIRE TO MAKE THIS A PART OF MY PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY SO HOW DO WE GET MORE MEN TO CARE ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT CAUSE
WELL LIKE ANY OTHER SOCIAL PROBLEM OR PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS
WE DO IT BY MAKING IT PERSONAL
WE DO IT BY MAKING IT RELATABLE
WE DO IT BY BRINGING IT CLOSE TO
HOME IN THE CASE OF RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE
THIS IS AN EASY THING TO DO EVEN IF IT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO CONSIDER
BECAUSE RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARE ALREADY PERSONAL
THEY'RE ALREADY RELATABLE THEY'RE ALREADY HITTING CLOSE TO HOME THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAS FOUND THAT IN THE UNITED STATES 1 IN 4 WOMEN WILL BE ABUSED BY A RELATIONSHIP PARTNER
EVERY SURVIVOR OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE DESERVES TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON IN THEIR LIFE WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT
TOO OFTEN IS ASSUMED THAT THIS PERSON WILL BE A MOTHER
OR A SISTER OR A DAUGHTER IN
MY EXPERIENCE IN GENERAL WOMEN HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF FILLING THIS ROLE BUT THINK OF HOW MUCH WE ARE LIMITING OURSELVES AS CULTURE BY CONTINUING THIS ASSUMPTION
SO THIS IS A CALL TO ACTION FOR MEN TO JOIN THE RANKS
TO STRENGTHEN OUR TEAM OF ALLIES
FOR ALL OF THE MEN THAT ARE LISTENING
AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE A WOMAN YOU CARE ABOUT WILL BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THIS PROBLEM ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL TURN TO YOU ARE
YOU CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL SEE YOU AS AN ALLY THANK YOU
4 YEARS AS A GRADUATE STUDENT AND IN MY FIRST 2 YEARS AS A YOUNG PROFESSIONAL
I SPENT TIME DOING CLINICAL WORK IN TWO COLLEGE COUNSELING CENTRES
TWO COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTRES
A STATE HOSPITAL
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT OF MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON
IT WAS ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT I STARTED TO NOTICE A COMMON THEME AMONG MANY OF MY CLIENTS
ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN WITH WHOM I WORKED
I WAS CONSISTENTLY SURPRISED AND SADDENED
BY THE NUMBER OF MY CLIENTS WHO HAD HISTORY OF SEXUAL TRAUMA
I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THIS WAS NOT THE CASE FOR ALL OF MY CLIENTS OR MAYBE EVEN THE MAJORITY
AND I HAD NUMBER OF MALE CLIENTS WITH SIMILAR LIFE EXPERIENCES
BUT IT DEFINITELY WAS A CONSISTENT
THEME REGARDLESS OF WHERE I WORKED OR WHAT MY CLIENTS LOOKED LIKE
SO MANY OF THEM WERE LIVING WITH INSTANCES OR MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF PRIOR VICTIMIZATION
SOMETIMES THIS CAME IN FORM OF A CURRENT ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO FLEE SOMETIMES IT CAME IN MEMORIES OF A CHILDHOOD MOURNED WITH THE YEARS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AT SOME OF THE PLACES I WORKED IT WAS ALMOST TAKEN AS A GIVEN THAT A CLIENT WOULD HAVE SUCH A HISTORY
A CLIENT WITHOUT A HISTORY OF ABUSE WAS THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVED THE RULE EVEN AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS EDUCATED AND AWARE
OF THE SIDED PREVALENTS RATES
I WAS STILL SURPRISED HOW MUCH AN ABUSE HISTORY WAS A UNIFYING THEME AMONG
MY THERAPY CLIENTS THERAPISTS TRAINED TO LISTEN TO THEIR CLIENTS
AND IF THEY LISTEN CAREFULLY AND WITHOUT JUDGEMENT THEY EVENTUALLY DEVELOP A DEEP SENSE OF EMPATHY
THIS COMES MORE EASILY AND MORE QUICKLY FOR SOME CLIENTS THAN IT DOES FOR OTHERS
BUT I PERSONALLY NEVER STRUGGLED TO FIND EMPATHY FOR MY CLIENTS WHO WERE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE OR RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE
AND AS IT OFTEN HAPPENS AS MY EMPATHY FOR INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS BEGAN TO GROW I DEVELOPED A DEEPER COMPASSION FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR AND
UP FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THESE SITUATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THINGS THEY HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN TRAINED FOR AND THEY'RE DOING
THAT SORT OF SITUATION IF WE SHOOT SOMEONE WHO WASN'T HOSTILE AT LEAST WE HAVEN'T KILLED THEM
FACT IF YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THE STUDIES THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE MATERIAL THEY WERE COLLECTING AND EXAMINING YOU CAN SEE
THE SUSPECTS WERE ONLY ARMED IN ABOUT 15 PERCENT OF CASES WHERE OC SPRAY WAS USED
IT WAS ROUTINELY BEING USED IN THIS PERIOD AND OF COURSE STILL
SORTS OF THINGS ANYBODY WHO IS HIT WITH THIS FEELS A SUDDEN BURST OF HEAT AND JUST WANTS TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
IT IS A LOT MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN A MICROWAVE OVEN BUT IT BASICALLY IS BOILING THE WATER MOLECULES IN THE VERY SURFACE LEVEL OF YOUR SKIN SO YOU FEEL THIS MASSIVE HEAT AND YOU GO I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND THEY
THINK THIS WILL BE REALLY USEFUL IN PLACES WHERE WE NEED TO CLEAR CROWD OUT OF A PARTICULAR AREA IF THE CROWD IS BEING HOSTILE IF WE NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM A PARTICULAR PLACE WE CAN DO THAT WITH THESE SORTS OF
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A BIG MICROWAVE TRANSMITTER IT'S SORT OF YOUR CLASSIC IDEA OF A HEAT RAY IT GOES OUT TO A REALLY LONG DISTANCE COMPARED TO
AT THE NUMBER OF TIMES GIVEN HOW THEY'VE INTRODUCED THIS THE NUMBER OF TIMES POLICE IN QUEENSLAND USED OC SPRAY IN THAT PERIOD HUNDREDS ONE THREE A
I THINK YES THERE MAY BE WAYS THAT NONLETHAL WEAPONS WILL BE GREAT IN THESE SITUATIONS BUT THERE'S ALSO WHOLE HEAP OF PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL
IF THE PERSON IS HOSTILE OR NOT IF THE PERSON DOESN'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS THEY MAY END UP SHOOTING THEM AND THEN FIND OUT AFTERWARDS EITHER
WEAPONS WE COULD GIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEM AND SAYING THESE THINGS WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL
THINGS AND RELATE IT TO THE MILITARY CONTEXT I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I STARTED TO DO THIS TO SEE THAT IN FACT EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATED THE USE OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS BY THE MILITARY
HADN'T ACTUALLY DONE THAT
THEY GENERALLY SEEMED TO THINK WHY WOULD WE CARE WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE POLICE WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND DIDN'T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THEY WERE LOOKING AT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME STUFF
SO I STARTED TO INVESTIGATE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE WAY POLICE USE NONLETHAL WEAPONS WHEN THEY'RE INTRODUCED AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT ARISE OUT OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY DO INTRODUCE THEM
AND OF COURSE BEING AUSTRALIAN I STARTED LOOKING AT STUFF IN AUSTRALIA KNOWING FROM MY OWN
NOW ONE OF THE PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT COMES UP WITH MILITARY USE OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY THERE MIGHT BE SOME PROBLEMS THERE'S A COUPLE OF PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THAT GET FOCUSED ON
ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS IS
NONLETHAL WEAPONS MAY BE USED INDISCRIMINATELY ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MILITARY USE OF FORCE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE DISCRIMINATE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO YOU'RE SHOOTING AT
SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS SUGGESTED WITH NONLETHAL WEAPONS IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE USED INDISCRIMINATELY THAT YOU WOULD USE THEM AGAINST A WHOLE RANGE OF PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH
FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE USE OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS WOULD ALSO BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS WITH THE POLICE AND SINCE WE'VE ALREADY HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH
BUT AS I SAID THE MILITARY AND THE POLICE ARE VERY DIFFERENT
THEY INTRODUCED OC SPRAY IN QUEENSLAND THEY WERE REALLY EXPLICIT THE POLICE MINISTER'S AND A HEAP OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT IT THEY WERE SAYING THIS IS EXPLICITLY INTENDED TO
ROBOTS OUT IN THE FIELD THAT ARE AUTONOMOUS THEY'LL MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHO TO SHOOT AND WHO NOT TO SHOOT WITHOUT A HUMAN IN THE LOOP SO THE SUGGESTION IS IF WE'RE GOING TO SEND ROBOTS OUT AND ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS MAYBE IT WOULD BE
THE WHOLE THEATER FULL OF THE GAS AND IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE DIED BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GAS EACH PERSON IS GOING TO INHALE WHAT POSITION THEY'LL FALL IN WHEN THEY BECOME UNCONSCIOUS AND SO ON
SHE'S 72 AND IT'S SEEN THAT THIS IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY OF DEALING WITH HER AND
A RANGE OF OTHER PEOPLE AROUND WHO ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO MIGHT ALSO GET HURT IT'D BE COLLATERAL DAMAGE THAT THE MILITARY OFTEN DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT SO AGAIN THEY'D SAY WITH ACCESS TO NONLETHAL WEAPONS IF WE'VE GOT SOMEONE WE KNOW IS HOSTILE WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO DEAL WITH THEM AND
I LOOKED AT IT I WAS REALLY SURPRISED APPARENTLY SHE TOOK UP A MORE THREATENING POSITION IN HER BED {LG} I KID YOU NOT THAT'S
FROM IT BECAUSE IN THE SAME DISTRICT
POLICE REVIEW POLICY
2ND CHILD SHOCKED BY TASER STUN GUN WITHIN WEEKS SAME POLICE DISTRICT
ANOTHER CHILD WITHIN WEEKS OF TASERING THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY JUST IN CASE YOU THINK IT'S ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES
IT
USED
TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE SIMPLY PASSIVELY NONCOMPLIANT
THIS PERSON IS NOT DOING ANYTHING VIOLENT BUT THEY JUST WON'T DO WHAT WE WANT THEM TO THEY'RE NOT OBEYING THE DIRECTIONS WE'RE GIVING THEM SO WE'LL GIVE THEM A SHOT OF THE OC SPRAY THAT'LL SPEED THEM UP EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT BETTER THAT
WAY THIS WAS SOMETHING EXPLICITLY INTRODUCED TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FIREARMS BUT IT'S BEING ROUTINELY USED TO DEAL WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER SORTS OF PROBLEMS
I CONFESS THIS PARTICULAR CASE WAS ONE THAT PIQUED MY INTEREST IN THIS IT HAPPENED WHILE I
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE MILITARY OF THE WESTERN WORLD
AUSTRALIA UNITED STATES THE UK AND SO ON FACE IN SOME OF THE DEPLOYMENTS THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH IN THE MODERN WORLD AT THIS TIME
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SORTS OF THINGS WE'VE SENT AUSTRALIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL TO IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE GOT OBVIOUS THINGS LIKE IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT THINGS LIKE EAST TIMOR AND THE SOLOMON ISLANDS AND SO ON
AND A LOT OF THESE DEPLOYMENTS THAT WE'RE SENDING MILITARY PERSONNEL TO THESE DAYS
AREN'T TRADITIONAL WARS
IN FACT A LOT OF THE JOBS WE'RE
TO USE IT PEOPLE GOING TO COMPLY WITH IT BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LEAVE ANY LASTING EFFECTS
OF THE THEATER THEY WERE HOLDING SOMETHING LIKE 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE THEY'D RELEASED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BUT THEY STILL HAD ABOUT 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE
AND THE RUSSIAN MILITARY POLICE SPECIAL FORCES SPETSNAZ CAME IN AND STORMED THE THEATER THE WAY THEY DID IT WAS TO PUMP THE WHOLE THING FULL OF ANESTHETIC GAS
THERE'S A WHOLE HEAP OF PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY TAUGHT TO USE NONLETHAL
TO TRAIN POLICE POLICE PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN JURISDICTIONS AT LEAST ARE TRAINED
TO DE ESCALATE FORCE
TO TRY AND AVOID USING FORCE WHEREVER POSSIBLE
AND TO USE LETHAL FORCE ONLY AS AN ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT
MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE BEING TRAINED FOR WAR
SO THEY'RE TRAINED THAT AS SOON AS THINGS GO BAD
THEIR FIRST RESPONSE IS LETHAL FORCE
THE MOMENT THE FECAL MATTER HITS THE ROTATING TURBINE
YOU CAN START SHOOTING AT PEOPLE
SO THEIR ATTITUDES TO THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE ARE VERY DIFFERENT
WHAT IT SAID SHE TOOK UP A MORE THREATENING POSITION IN HER BED
OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS SO WHY IS THIS RELEVANT BECAUSE POLICE ARE ACTUALLY MORE RESTRAINED IN THE USE OF FORCE THAN THE MILITARY ARE THEY'RE TRAINED TO BE MORE RESTRAINED IN THE USE OF FORCE THAN THE MILITARY ARE THEY'RE TRAINED TO THINK MORE TO TRY AND DE ESCALATE
PROBLEM THEY TALKED ABOUT THAT IT MIGHT BE USED INDISCRIMINATELY A SECOND PROBLEM PEOPLE SOMETIMES TALK ABOUT WITH MILITARY USE OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS AND IT'S ACTUALLY WHY IN THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT YOU CAN'T USE RIOT CONTROL AGENTS AS WEAPONS OF
WARFARE IS THAT IT'S SEEN THAT SOMETIMES NONLETHAL WEAPONS MIGHT BE USED NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO LETHAL FORCE BUT AS A LETHAL FORCE MULTIPLIER
THAT YOU USE NONLETHAL WEAPONS FIRST SO YOUR LETHAL WEAPONS WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE
THE PEOPLE YOU'LL BE SHOOTING AT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY THEY WON'T BE AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU CAN KILL THEM BETTER
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE
THINGS AND THERE'S A RANGE OF PLACES YOU'D THINK THOSE THINGS WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL
BEFORE BUT THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY QUEENSLAND ANYONE KNOW WHERE THAT WAS
CAPSICUM SPRAY PEPPER SPRAY
BY AUSTRALIAN POLICE AND SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN THAT HAD BEEN INTRODUCED AND THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES
AND ONE STUDY THAT I FOUND A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ONE WAS IN QUEENSLAND
BECAUSE THEY HAD A TRIAL PERIOD FOR THE USE OF PEPPER SPRAY BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY INTRODUCED IT MORE BROADLY
AND I
HE WAS PROBABLY SIX INCHES TALLER THAN ME AND SHE WAS ABOUT THIS TALL AND EVENTUALLY SHE SAID TO HIM WELL I'M GOING TO GET BACK IN MY CAR AND HE SAYS IF YOU GET BACK IN YOUR CAR I'M GOING TO TASE YOU AND SHE
OF PEOPLE WHO GOT SHOT IN THIS EPISODE SO WHEN THEY HAD A LOOK AT IT AFTERWARD THERE WERE ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO'D APPARENTLY BEEN
THESE PROBLEMS WITH POLICE OFFICERS WITH NONLETHAL WEAPONS WHAT ON EARTH WOULD MAKE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER WITH MILITARY PERSONNEL
ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE WHERE I THINK THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHERE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT WAS THE DUBROVKA THEATER SIEGE IN MOSCOW IN
INSTEAD OF A FIREARM IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD TO SHOOT SOMEONE
IF THEY WERE ARMED WITH NONLETHAL WEAPONS SO IF THE ROBOT MAKES A BAD DECISION AND SHOOTS THE WRONG PERSON AGAIN THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY KILLED THEM
DIFFERENTLY FOR NOW THERE'S A BUNCH OF REASONS WHY WE SEND MILITARY PERSONNEL RATHER THAN POLICE TO DO THESE JOBS IF AUSTRALIA HAD TO SEND 1000 PEOPLE TOMORROW TO WEST PAPUA FOR EXAMPLE
WE DON'T HAVE 1000 POLICE OFFICERS HANGING AROUND THAT COULD GO TOMORROW AND WE DO HAVE 1000 SOLDIERS THAT COULD GO
SO WHEN WE HAVE TO SEND SOMEONE WE SEND THE MILITARY THEY'RE THERE THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND HECK THEY'RE USED TO GOING OFF AND DOING THESE THINGS AND LIVING BY THEMSELVES AND NOT HAVING ALL THIS EXTRA SUPPORT
SO THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT IN THAT SENSE
BUT THEY AREN'T TRAINED THE SAME WAY POLICE OFFICERS ARE AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT EQUIPPED THE WAY POLICE OFFICERS ARE SO THIS HAS RAISED BUNCH OF PROBLEMS FOR THEM WHEN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES
ONE PARTICULAR THING THAT'S COME UP THAT I AM ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WHEN WE'RE SENDING MILITARY PERSONNEL TO DO THESE SORTS OF JOBS WE OUGHT TO BE EQUIPPING THEM DIFFERENTLY AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER WE OUGHT TO BE GIVING
A DRINK IN FRONT OF ME WITH THIS NAPKIN UNDER IT AND THIS STRAW IN IT
WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH THIS MASSIVE ISSUE WHERE CAUSE AND EFFECT ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATED IF YOU LIVE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD LIKE I DO YOU'RE PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO SEE THE WHOLE IMPACT THAT YOUR LIFESTYLE ACTUALLY
THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS THE RESOURCES USED TO MAKE IT OR THE WRAPPING AT THE STORE OR THE EXTRACTION OF THOSE RESOURCES
AND THE ENERGY USED TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS
FOR EVERY POUND OF TRASH WE CREATE SEVEN POUNDS ARE CREATED UPSTREAM
NOW ALL OF THIS IS A REAL DOWNER I'M SORRY
BUT IT REPRESENTS A CHOICE RIGHT
THAT'S THE FLIP SIDE
WITH EVERY
SO WHAT WE NEED IS NOT THE NEXT EASY FIX WE NEED SOMETHING MANAGEABLY HARD THAT HAS A REAL IMPACT THAT'S WHERE TRASH COMES IN SUPER HANDY BECAUSE FOR EVERY
WHAT
I STARTED TO REALIZE WAS THAT BY LIVING WITHOUT TRASH
I HAD TO ENLIST THE HELP OF EVERYONE AROUND ME
MY PROFESSORS HAD TO AGREE TO LET ME SEND THEM HOMEWORK VIA EMAIL
MY WAIT STAFF HAD TO REMEMBER NOT TO PUT THE STRAW IN THE WATER
AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE ME COME OFF AS TOTAL SNOB
BUT
WHAT I QUICKLY REALIZED WAS THAT
IF YOU JUST CHECK YOUR EGO
AND UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS A LITTLE BIT RIDICULOUS
IT QUICKLY BECOMES A TEAM EFFORT
RATHER THAN AN IMPOSITION OF MY VALUES ON SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE
THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS THAT
WHEN ONCE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AN ACCOMPLICE TO AN ACT OF TRASHLESSNESS
THEY START TO THINK ABOUT THEIR OWN IMPACT
OR YOU GET TEXTS WEEKS AFTER HAVING A MEAL WITH SOMEONE OF SOMEONE IS SAYING HEY SAM
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT TOILET PAPER
OR I'LL GET A SNAPSHOT OF A NAPKIN THAT SOMEONE DIDN'T USE
AND BY THE WAY WE STILL USE TOILET PAPER DON'T WORRY
THIS
ASPECT OF GOING ZERO WASTE THAT FORCES CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT
IS I GUESS A KIND OF ACTIVISM
EVERY BAG
EVERY NEW ITEM WE BUY
WE HAVE A DIRECT INFLUENCE ON ALL THOSE SYSTEMS
AND WE CAN OPT OUT
THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE IS WON AND LOST BILLIONS OF TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY IN EACH OF OUR CHOICES
THIS REALIZATION WAS CRUCIAL FOR MY SISTER AND ME BECAUSE
EVEN THOUGH WE FELT GREAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING A ZERO WASTE YEAR
IN REALITY WE WEREN'T HAVING THAT MUCH OF AN IMPACT RIGHT
BECAUSE THE TWO OF US DOING IT FOR A YEAR IS ABOUT 20000 POUNDS OF WASTE
WHICH IS GREAT
BUT NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH
SO OVER CHRISTMAS BREAK AT ABOUT 4 A M
I SHAKE LYDIA AWAKE AND WE HAVE AN IDEA
THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY ONLY HAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
WHAT IF
INSTEAD OF SOME NOW JEAN CARRYING SAME PAIR OF JEANS SINCE AUGUST OF 07 HAVING OR SHOWER WHEN I'M DEAD ENVIRONMENTALIST
DOING THIS FOR MONTHS AND YEARS
WHAT IF EVERYONE OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD DID THIS FOR A DAY TRIED IT
AND THEN IF THEY WANTED TO EXTEND IT FOR A WEEK OR A MONTH WE'D BE THERE TO HELP THEM
SO WE GOT SERIOUS AND STARTED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED LIVE ZERO WASTE
WITH THE GOAL OF GIVING PEOPLE RESOURCES AND A COMMUNITY WHO ARE TRYING TO LIVE TRASH FREE
NOW WHAT GOT US
WE NOW MORE THAN EVER
HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE THE ENVIRONMENT WE LIVE IN
WE'RE THE FIRST GENERATION TO KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT WHAT WE'VE DONE TO THIS PLANET
BUT ALSO WHAT WE CAN DO TO FIX IT
SO I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH A PROMISE AND REQUEST
MY
THAT GOING WASTE FREE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A SACRIFICE IN CERTAIN WAYS
BUT HUGELY REWARDING IN OTHERS
WITHOUT EVEN NOTICING IT IT SHIFTS YOUR FOCUS FROM STUFF
TO RELATIONSHIPS
FROM MONEY SPENT ON THINGS TO TIME SPENT ON EXPERIENCES
GOING ZERO WASTE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PROBLEMS BIG IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS
AND ADDRESS THEM IN OUR DAILY LIVES
WITH OUR DAILY CHOICES
SO INSTEAD OF ASKING WHAT WILL OUR GOVERNMENT DO TO FIX THIS OR WHY ISN'T THIS NGO DOING MORE THE QUESTIONS BECOME
CAN EACH OF US SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS COME TOGETHER AND MAKE THE CHOICES WE KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE
CAN WE BE THE BOLD ONES
TO CUT INTO WHAT WE THOUGHT OF AS NECESSITIES
WHO'S GOING TO STEP UP AND BE THE EXCEPTION THAT IN TIME WILL DEFINE A WHOLE NEW SET OF RULES
AND I THINK IT'S YOU
NOW I'M JUST SOME COLLEGE STUDENT
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE
ABOUT THIS IDEA WAS THAT EVEN JUST TRYING FOR A DAY WOULD AT LEAST GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO AUDIT THEIR LIVES AND REALIZE THAT TRASH IS CHOICE
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE PRODUCT MIGHT BE RECYCABLE THAT 95 STILL APPLIES YOU JUST DON'T SEE IT IF WE'RE BEING HONEST WITH OURSELVES WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT WE
THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY GOOD AT EXPORTING ALL THE BAD STUFF AND IMPORTING THE FINISHED PRODUCT 95 OF A
ON THE EIGHTEEN HOUR PLANE RIDE BACK FROM CHINA I DIDN'T DRINK ANY WATER BECAUSE THEY MAKE ME DUMP OUT MY WATER BOTTLE BEFORE BOARDING AND WHEN I DID GET BACK THE FIRST THING I DID WAS CREATE TRASH I
YES THEY COULD SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY COULD SEE YES I CAN
CHANGE SOMETHING
BECAUSE WHAT IS SO POWERFUL ABOUT THIS WAY OF LIFE ISN'T NECESSARILY THE TRASH YOU AVOID
IT'S THE IDEA THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR TRASH
COULD BY A SIMPLE INCREASE IN AWARENESS
AND LITTLE CREATIVITY
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WASTES 4 4 POUNDS OF TRASH PER DAY
BUT GOING ZERO WASTE FOR A DAY IS MORE THAN THAT 4 4 POUNDS
IT'S THAT AND THE THIRTY PLUS POUNDS FOR THE UPSTREAM IMPACT
IT'S HAVING A TANGIBLE REPRESENTATION OF YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT
AND IT'S THE AWARENESS THAT IMPARTS ON EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU MEET DURING YOUR TRASH FREE DAY
THAT I WAS DOING THE WHOLE WASTE FREE THING AND BUYING A BRAND NEW CHAIN TOOL TO REPAIR A BIKE A LOT OF GOOD THAT DID ME LOW
TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE LIVING WASTE FREE AS ACCESSIBLE AS POSSIBLE
AND TO BUILD A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE COMMITTED TO TAKING CONCRETE ACTION AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE
AND MY REQUEST
THAT EACH OF YOU
TOMORROW
WHETHER YOU'RE IN THIS AUDITORIUM OR WATCHING ONLINE
GIVE LIVING ZERO WASTE A SHOT FOR ONE DAY
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS CALLED ME UP THE OTHER DAY AND SHE SAID I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HOW I WOULD DO THIS I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START HOW DO YOU DO IT
AND IF I THOUGHT THIS WERE SOME HERCULEAN TASK I'D FEEL THE NEED TO GIVE YOU DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
BUT HONESTLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS WAKING UP TOMORROW MORNING
MAKING A CHOICE
AND STICKING TO IT AS BEST YOU CAN
AND IF YOU MESS UP
PUT IT IN A BAG
OR A PIZZA BOX
I
THINK YOU'LL BE SURPRISED BY HOW MUCH WASTE YOU CAN AVOID
USE TOO MUCH NEW STUFF AND USE TOO MANY RESOURCES
BUT THE SOLUTION
IS SCARY
NOT GETTING NEW STUFF
IS REALLY HARD IT'S THE WORST
KEEPING THAT SHIRT FOR NEXT YEAR ISN'T THAT SEXY
GETTING YOUR PHONE OFF CRAIGSLIST RATHER THAN BUYING THE NEWEST MODEL
ISN'T THAT CHIC
IT DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT TO TURN DOWN THAT PIECE OF GUM BUT REAL ACTION
THE KIND THAT ADDRESSES OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS GOING TO BE JUST THAT
CHALLENGING
CUTTING YOUR DEPENDENCY ON TRASH IS LITTLE HARD
BUT HARD IS GOOD IN THIS CASE
IN FACT
HARD IS GREAT
IT FORCES US TO NOTICE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS MY MISTAKES RANGED FROM HAVING TO BUY
IT'S A CONSTANTLY FALLING PROCESS SO EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NOTHING IN NATURE THAT LOOKS
FOR US ROBOTICISTS ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS THESE TOOLS
ARE THE COURSES AND CLASSES YOU TAKE IN CLASS
MATH DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS I HAVE LINEAR ALGEBRA
SCIENCE PHYSICS EVEN NOWADAYS CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AS YOU'VE SEEN THESE ARE ALL THE TOOLS WE NEED SO THE MORE TOOLS YOU HAVE FOR BATMAN MORE EFFECTIVE AT FIGHTING THE BAD GUYS FOR US MORE TOOLS TO ATTACK THESE KINDS OF BIG
YOU SEND THESE REMOTELY CONTROLLED VEHICLES THAT ARE ARMED IT TAKES REALLY A LOT OF TIME AND IT'S EXPENSIVE TO TRAIN THE OPERATOR TO OPERATE THIS COMPLEX ARM
DOLLARS TO MAKE THE FIRST PROTOTYPE THIS ROBOT IS ACTUALLY A FAMILY OF SNAKE
IF YOU WANT TO GO BEYOND HOBBY OF ROBOTICS AND REALLY TACKLE THE GRAND CHALLENGES OF ROBOTICS THROUGH RIGOROUS RESEARCH WE NEED MORE THAN THAT THIS IS WHERE SCHOOL COMES IN
LEG HYBRID ROBOT SO THINK OF A RIMLESS WHEEL OR A SPOKE
NOW THIS ROBOT IS CURRENTLY OUR STAR ROBOT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FAN CLUB FOR THE ROBOT
A FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE THAT CAN DRIVE INTO URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WE WON A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE DARPA URBAN CHALLENGE WE ALSO HAVE THE WORLD'S VERY FIRST VEHICLE THAT CAN BE DRIVEN BY THE BLIND WE CALL IT THE BLIND DRIVER CHALLENGE VERY EXCITING AND MANY MANY OTHER ROBOTICS PROJECTS I WANT TO TALK
{NS} THANK YOU {NS} DARWIN ALSO HAS A LOT OF OTHER TALENTS LAST YEAR IT ACTUALLY CONDUCTED THE ROANOKE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA FOR THE HOLIDAY
GIVE IT ALL THE COMPUTING POWER IT NEEDS A 1 5 GIGAHERTZ PENTIUM M CHIP TWO FIREWIRE CAMERAS RATE GYROS ACCELEROMETERS FOUR FORCED SENSORS ON THE FOOT LITHIUM POLYMER BATTERIES AND NOW DARWIN II IS COMPLETELY
AND GO TO BED EVERY DAY IN THE MORNING THE FIRST THING I DO BEFORE MY FIRST CUP OF COFFEE BEFORE I BRUSH MY TEETH I OPEN MY
THE REAL INTERESTING SCIENCE THE SCIENCE RICH SITES ARE ALWAYS AT THE
YOUR BUILT IN DYNAMICS THE PHYSICS OF YOUR BODY JUST LIKE A PENDULUM
THE ACTUAL GOAL OF ROBOCUP IS BY THE YEAR 2050 WE WANT TO HAVE FULL SIZE AUTONOMOUS HUMANOID ROBOTS PLAY SOCCER AGAINST THE HUMAN WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS AND WIN
IT'S A TRUE ACTUAL GOAL IT'S A VERY AMBITIOUS GOAL BUT WE TRULY BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT THIS IS LAST YEAR IN CHINA WE WERE THE VERY FIRST TEAM IN THE UNITED STATES THAT QUALIFIED IN THE HUMANOID ROBOCUP
WE WRITE A RESEARCH PROPOSAL GET THE RESEARCH FUNDING IN AND THAT'S HOW WE START OUR RESEARCH PROGRAMS
BUT JUST A SPARK OF IMAGINATION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH HOW DO WE DEVELOP THESE KINDS OF IDEAS AT OUR LAB ROMELA THE ROBOTICS AND MECHANISMS LABORATORY WE HAVE THESE
FANTASTIC BRAINSTORMING
WE HAVE FIVE SECRETS
FIRST IS WHERE DO WE GET INSPIRATION WHERE DO WE GET THIS SPARK OF IMAGINATION THIS IS A TRUE STORY MY PERSONAL STORY
AT NIGHT WHEN I GO TO BED AT THREE FOUR IN THE MORNING I LIE DOWN CLOSE MY EYES AND I SEE THESE LINES AND CIRCLES AND DIFFERENT SHAPES FLOATING AROUND AND THEY ASSEMBLE AND THEY FORM THESE KINDS OF MECHANISMS AND THINK AH THIS IS COOL SO RIGHT NEXT TO MY BED I KEEP A NOTEBOOK A JOURNAL WITH A SPECIAL PEN THAT HAS AN LED LIGHT ON IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TURN ON THE LIGHT AND WAKE UP MY WIFE
SO I SEE
IN THE MORNING WHAT DO YOU EXPECT RIGHT SO I NEED TO DECIPHER WHAT I WROTE BUT SOMETIMES I SEE THIS INGENIOUS IDEA IN THERE AND I HAVE THIS EUREKA MOMENT I DIRECTLY RUN TO MY HOME OFFICE SIT AT MY COMPUTER I TYPE IN THE IDEAS I SKETCH THINGS OUT AND I KEEP A DATABASE OF IDEAS
THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY NEAT VERY GOOD ROBOTIC HANDS OUT THERE ON THE
METERS TALL YOU CAN SEE OVER OBSTACLES LIKE BUSHES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO WE HAVE TWO
COLD WATER THIS WATER IS WARM SO WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT I COULD STICK IT IN A REFRIGERATOR OR I COULD POUR IT IN A GLASS WITH SOME ICE AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THE WATER WILL BE
OR IDEA WE HAVE
AND WHAT WE WOULD IN FACT BE DOING
IS WE WOULD BE CREATING A SYSTEM
IN WHICH WE CREATE VALUE
WE TRANSFER THAT VALUE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE FORM OF SALES WHO THEN PAY US FOR IT
AND HOPEFULLY WE MAKE SOME MONEY
THAT'S
YET WE YOU LOOK INTO ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMPANIES WHAT DO YOU FIND YOU FIND MANAGEMENT AGAINST EMPLOYEES GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES AGAINST OTHER GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES SALES AGAINST
IT'S BUILT ON AT THE CORE YOUR SELF RESPECT AND YOUR SELF TRUST THESE THINGS GIVE YOU SELF CONFIDENCE BECAUSE YOU TRUST IN YOUR DECISIONS YOU
PROBLEMS WHEN WE HAVE SERIOUS CHALLENGES HOW LIKELY ARE THE PEOPLE IF THEY THEY DON'T TRUST AND RESPECT EACH OTHER TO SEEK EACH OTHER OUT TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS
BUT THAT'S WHAT COMPANIES NEED THAT'S WHAT ORGANIZATIONS NEED THEY NEED PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO COLLABORATE TO
YOU CONSIDER THEM
THIS IS TREATING PEOPLE FAIRLY
THIS IS TREATING PEOPLE WITH RESPECT
AND THIS IS THE BASIS FOR LEARNING
I SEEK OUT AND LEARN FROM PEOPLE I
THAT IT EVEN HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LEVELS OF SUCCESS THAT WE EXPERIENCE INDIVIDUALLY IN OUR FAMILIES
AND IN OUR BUSINESSES
ALL OF US IN HERE TOGETHER WE COULD START A BIG BUSINESS
YOUR IDEAS YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON AND WHO YOU ARE NOT AND WITH THESE THINGS YOU HAVE SELF CONFIDENCE THINK ABOUT THE PERSON YOU KNOW WHO HAS NO SELF RESPECT AND NO SELF
TO HAVE TRUST AND RESPECT BETWEEN EACH OTHER
THE MOST BASIC GROUP IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE FAMILY
WHAT HAPPENS
IN A FAMILY
IF THE PARENTS LOSE TRUST IN THEIR KIDS
OR IF THE
COMPANY HE SAID GREG I NEED MY SALES PEOPLE TO BE MORE ASSERTIVE TO TAKE MORE INITIATIVE NOW THEY SIT AND WAIT FOR THE PHONE TO RING THEY DON'T GO OUT AND BUILD
WHEN WILL THIS PERSON START TO FUNCTION WHEN THEY DEVELOP SOME SELF CONFIDENCE WHEN THEY DEVELOP
AND FOR TRUST THE BELIEF I HAVE ABOUT SOMEBODY I TRUST IS THAT THIS PERSON WON'T DO ANYTHING TO HURT ME WON'T DO ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE MY INTERESTS AND THE MOST TRUST COMES
DIVERSITY AND DISINTEGRATION ON STEROIDS THINGS CAN BREAK DOWN LIKE THAT BEFORE YOU KNOW
IT
SO WHAT DO WE LEARN IN MANAGEMENT EDUCATION TO TRY TO OVERCOME THIS DISINTEGRATION OF ENERGY
WHAT WE
NOT ONE NOT TWO BUT THREE SIGNATURES FROM THREE DIFFERENT MANAGERS TO SPEND 70 EUROS IT'S A COMPANY
IS GONE THE COMPANY THE COUNTRY WON'T BE MORE SUCCESSFUL BUT THEY WILL STRUGGLE AND THEY
WE HAVE GOT OUR GROUP HERE THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A STARTUP COMPANY AND IN THIS GROUP WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE NEEDS AND DIVERSE WANTS
DIFFERENT INTERESTS
DIFFERENT STYLES OF WORKING AND MAKING DECISIONS
ALL OF THAT
THAT BREED DISTRUST I WAS TALKING WITH THE
TRUST AND RESPECT EACH OTHER
THIS IS HOW RAISE OUR KIDS ISN'T
IT HOW DO YOU MAKE A FAMILY OUT OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLES YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR SPOUSE YOU BOTH ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE KIDS THE KIDS ARE ALL DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER THIS CAN BE A MESS
HOW DO YOU MAKE A
30 YEARS IN ALL OF THAT TIME I'VE MET LOT OF AMAZING PEOPLE FROM WHOM I'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT AND RIGHT
I HAVE TO PAY IT BACK THE FIRST MESSAGE FROM MANAGEMENT IS THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM YOU I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT
TO WORK TOGETHER
SO THAT THEY WILL SOLVE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN LOOK FOR WHO'S TO BLAME FOR THE PROBLEMS AND THIS IS THE JOB OF LEADERSHIP
TO GET VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER SO THEIR
IN THEMSELVES AND RESPECT IN THEMSELVES
THEN THE SELF DOUBTS THEN THE FEARS START TO SUBSIDE AND THIS CONVERSATION
THIS NEGATIVE DIALOGUE GOING ON THEIR HEAD THE VOICES OF DISSENSION CALM DOWN
AND NOW WHAT THE ENERGY IS ALL
BUT KEEP IN MIND TWO THINGS ONE THE TRAVEL SHOULD AND MUST BE
TO OUR MISSION TO GIVE HEARING IMPAIRED PEOPLE A NORMAL QUALITY OF LIFE AND TWO
ENERGY DISSIPATES IT DISINTEGRATES THIS IS THE BASIS FOR ENTROPY ENTROPY IS THE
DIFFERENTLY FROM YOU THAT'S RESPECT HOW DO YOU SHOW DISRESPECT TO SOMEBODY WHEN YOU SAY HOW
BUILD TRUST AND RESPECT IN OURSELVES IN GROUPS WE DO IT BETWEEN PEOPLE BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT WE HAVE OUR COMPANY HERE I CAN'T JUST GO TO THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANY HERE AND SAY YOU GUYS TRUST AND RESPECT
DISINTEGRATES
AND IT'S THE SAME IN A COMPANY
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S THE SAME IN A COUNTRY
IF YOU ARE A CEO OR A PRIME MINISTER
THE MOST IMPORTANT
OTICON WHEN HE TOOK OVER HE COMPLETELY DISMANTLED THE SYSTEM OF PREAPPROVALS FOR COMPANY TRAVEL JUST DO IT OUT AND IT WAS
I NEED THEM TO TAKE MORE RISKS I SAID YEAH THAT SOUNDS REALLY IMPORTANT SO I WENT AND TALKED TO ONE OF HIS SALES PEOPLE HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY RISKS FOR THIS COMPANY I SAID
THINK ABOUT THE PERSON YOU KNOW WHO IS ALWAYS WORKING IN THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST WHILE DISREGARDING YOUR OWN INTERESTS QUICKLY YOU'LL LOSE TRUST FOR THIS PERSON WE
THAT THEY USE TO KEEP PEOPLE FOCUSED GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION CHANNELING THEIR ENERGY
THEY'VE GOT STUDIES IN TEAM DYNAMICS AND MORE LEADERSHIP WITH MORE TOOLS WITH WHICH WE CAN BUILD A STRONG AND ALINED
GROUP OF PEOPLE
ALL OF THESE ARE VALID TOOLS
THEY ALL WORK
BUT HOW WELL THEY WORK
AND HOW SUSTAINABLE THEY ARE IS
THE HEAT WHICH IS ENERGY TRAVELS FROM THE WARM WATER TO THE COLD ICE THEREBY COOLING THE
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
WHY
BECAUSE PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER JUSTIFY ALWAYS FLYING BUSINESS CLASS
HE WENT ON TO TURN THIS 25 MILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS INTO A HALF BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS OVER 10 YEARS BY FOCUSING
PHONE BUT IF YOU WANT TO YOU CAN PUT THIS FLAT MAP ON ANY SCREEN OF ANY DEVICE AND IT WON'T GET DISTORTED BEING A
OF PAPER AND IF I DO THAT THOSE LINES STAY THE SAME DISTANCE APART
OF SPACE IT CAN EVEN AFFECT HOW OBJECTS IN THE SPACE BEHAVE
EINSTEIN AND HIS COLLEAGUES ARGUED AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT WHAT WAS THE PROPER TOPOLOGY TO CHOOSE TO GUESS
FOR SPACE FOR THE UNIVERSE
WHICH MAKES YOU UNDERSTAND THAT GENERAL RELATIVITY DOESN'T PREDICT THE TOPOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSE
WE HAVE TO GO OUT
AND OBSERVE IT
BUT
WHICH IS MORE THAN 180 SO THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF THE TRIANGLE ON THIS SPHERE IS MORE THAN 180 NO MATTER WHAT TRIANGLE I DRAW ON THIS SPHERE THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF THE TRIANGLE
I CAN HEAD WEST ALONG THE EQUATOR A QUARTER OF THE WAY AROUND THE EARTH AND THEN I TAKE A 90 DEGREE TURN
AND HEAD NORTH TO THE NORTH POLE
AND THEN I CAN TAKE ANOTHER 90 DEGREE RIGHT TURN
AND HEAD SOUTH
EXACTLY TO WHERE I STARTED AND I WILL GET
ANOTHER TRIANGLE
EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF GRAVITY
AND GR IS THEORY ABOUT SPACE AND TIME
EINSTEIN'S FIELD EQUATIONS WHICH HE ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN 1915 TELL US HOW MATTER AFFECTS BOTH SPACE AND TIME AND HOW SPACE AND TIME AFFECT MATTER
BUT EINSTEIN'S
WELL
FORTUNATELY WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ALL IS LOST
WE THINK THERE'S ONE LAST CHANCE
AND IT HAS TO DO WE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN
THE TOPOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSE BUT WE BELIEVE WE CAN HEAR THE TOPOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSE
AND THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF THAT TRIANGLE WILL BE 180 DEGREES IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE I PUT THE TRIANGLE ON THE FLAT SHEET OF
APPARENTLY WE'RE LEARNING THAT THERE ARE SURFACES OF DIFFERENT CURVATURE THIS SPHERE IS NOT FLAT IT'S POSITIVELY CURVED THERE ARE ALSO SURFACES
AND I COULD WRAP IT UP INTO A CYLINDER AND IF I HAVE A CYLINDER THEN I CAN HEAD OFF IN SOME DIRECTION AND BY GOING STRAIGHT COME RIGHT BACK TO WHERE I STARTED JUST LIKE ON THE SPHERE
AND NOTICING THE ARCTIC ICE SHEETS AND NOTICING THE GREAT SAND DESERTS OF THE
I'D FALL OF THE EDGE WELL I COULD MAKE THE PAPER BIGGER BUT NO MATTER WHAT I'M GOING TO
IN ANY DIRECTION
AND KEEP GOING STRAIGHT WITHOUT TURNING
I WILL COME BACK
TO EXACTLY WHERE I STARTED
I CAN HEAD ANY DIRECTION I COULD HEAD OFF TO THIS WAY
AND I CAN GO AROUND
AND I DON'T HAVE TO TURN
TO COME BACK TO WHERE I
BOTH COME BACK TO WHERE THEY STARTED WITHOUT ANY TURNING NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WAIT YOU'RE TRYING TO TRICK ME
OF THE EARTH SOON ENOUGH WE WILL HAVE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAYS THAT ALLOW US TO DO THAT BUT IN THE
OF LIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE BOUNCED AROUND THEY COULDN'T GO VERY FAR
BUT AS THE UNIVERSE GREW OLDER IT EXPANDED AND GREW COOLER
AND WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS ABOUT 400000 YEARS OLD IT
WAS ONLY ABOUT HALF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURFACE OF THE SUN
AND AT THAT POINT THAT PLASMA BECAME A TRANSPARENT GAS
THE LIGHT WAS RELEASED
AND HAS BEEN TRAVELING
NO MATTER WHAT TOPOLOGY THERE WAS AS LONG AS THERE
WERE
TWO PATHS AROUND THE UNIVERSE ONE FROM EACH SIDE OF THAT CIRCLE TO ME
I WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THESE PAIRS OF MATCHING CIRCLES I'D BE ABLE TO SEE THAT CIRCLE IN SPACE
FROM TWO SIDES
THEN YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES YOU EITHER DISTORT THE SHAPES OF THE CONTINENTS AND THE SEAS OR YOU CUT THE MAP INTO ALL SORTS OF INCONVENIENT ANNOYING SHAPES IF YOU DON'T NEED TO PULL THE MAP OF THE EARTH OUT OF
DRUMS OF DIFFERENT SHAPE AND WHEN I HIT THEM THEY MAKE DIFFERENT SOUNDS IF YOU
PLACES IT HAD TO CLIMB TOWARDS US AND LOSE ENERGY
AS IT LEFT THE LESS DENSE PLACES IT HAD TO CLIMB LESS AND IT LOST LESS ENERGY
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE DENSE PLACES SHOULD APPEAR A LITTLE COOLER AND THE LESS DENSE
LIKE TRYING TO PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AROUND THE WHOLE THING SEEING ALL OF REALITY AND EVENTUALLY FINDING YOUR PLACE IN IT
ME OVER HERE CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE THAT CIRCLE OFF IN
AND IF THE MAPMAKERS DID THEIR JOB THEN YOU CAN USE THIS MAP TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE CITY TO EXPLORE THE CITY WITHOUT CONCERN ABOUT GETTING LOST
CIRCUMNAVIGATED THE EARTH
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE DISTANCES ARE MEASURED IN BILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS
WELL CLEARLY WE CAN'T
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE THAT JOURNEY FOR US
AND ARRIVE BACK TO WHERE I STARTED BECAUSE I'VE FOLLOWED A LOOP AROUND THE UNIVERSE
THIS IS THE PROPERTY THAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON FOR THE REST OF THIS TALK
THE WAYS IN WHICH IN A SPACE WE CAN HEAD OFF IN SOME DIRECTION AND COME BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED BECAUSE THOSE DESCRIBE THE TOPOLOGY OF THE SPACE THE WAYS IN WHICH THE SPACE IS
YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALMOST ANY PAIR OF DRUMS
THE SHAPE OF THE DRUM IMPRINTS ITSELF ON THE SOUND
DIFFERENT DRUMS DIFFERENT SOUNDS
LISTEN CAREFULLY AND TELL THE SHAPE OF THE DRUM
SO TOO THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE
THE TOPOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSE IS LIKE THE RIM OF THE DRUM
HE'S DOING THE SAME THING HE'S MAKING A MEASUREMENT OF THE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND HE HAS A MICROWAVE ANTENNA
IS COMING TO HIM FROM A VAST SPHERE 14 BILLION LIGHT YEARS IN RADIUS CENTERED
SURFACE I CAN DRAW A TRIANGLE
ON THE CYLINDER THERE'S ONE BY GOING AROUND IT AND ON THE TORUS THERE ARE
DIFFERENT TYPES
OF LOOPS
WHICH ARE STRAIGHT I CAN START HERE AND HEAD AROUND AND THROUGH THE HOLE
OR I CAN START HERE AND HEAD STRAIGHT ALONG
THIS TORUS THIS DOUGHNUT SHAPE AND COME BACK TO WHERE I STARTED BY GOING
OVER HERE CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE THAT CIRCLE IN THIS DIRECTION
BUT OF COURSE IT'S THE SAME ME
AND THAT MEANS
THAT THERE WILL BE A CIRCLE ON THE SKY THAT I SEE OVER HERE
AND THAT I ALSO SEE OVER HERE WHICH IS THE SAME PLACE IN SPACE AND THEREFORE HAS THE EXACT SAME PATTERN OF HOT
IN RADIUS CENTERED ON ME AND MY FRIEND OVER
IS AND HOW VAST THE RUSSIAN STEPPES ARE AND THEN EVENTUALLY BEING ABLE TO LOOK AROUND AND SAY I LIVE HERE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO
AND SO IF I WAS LIVING IN THE SHEET OF PAPER AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE THEN WHEN I WENT AND MEASURED THE ANGLES OF THAT TRIANGLE THEY WOULD STILL ADD UP TO 180 DEGREES AND IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN BY FLAT
THEN WE HAVE A SURFACE IN WHICH
IT'S BOTH FLAT AND I CAN GO AROUND IT BY HEADING STRAIGHT
SO THE LESSON IS THAT SPACES CAN HAVE THE SAME GEOMETRY THE SAME CURVATURE
BUT DIFFERENT TOPOLOGIES DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING CONNECTED
ON THE SHEET THERE ARE NO WAYS OF GOING STRAIGHT AND COMING BACK
IT'S CALLED A GLOBE {LG} SO ONE OF THE NICE PROPERTIES OF A GLOBE IS THAT IT IS
IT POSSESSES CERTAIN PROPERTIES THAT WE'VE KNOWN FOR OVER 2300 YEARS SINCE EUCLID TAUGHT THEM TO US LET ME SHOW YOU SOME
NOW THAT'S NOT VERY INTERESTING IF WE'RE JUST SEPARATED
NOW WITH BEING EXPOSED TO THESE THREE LANGUAGES MY FAMILY CREATED ITS OWN HYBRID LANGUAGE WHICH CONSISTED
OF THESE THREE LANGUAGES SO WE WOULD SAY WORDS THAT WOULD
MEAN THE SAME THING BUT WOULD BE EASIER TO SAY SO FOR WORDS THAT MEANT THE SAME THING BUT ONLY HAD TWO SYLLABLES COMPARED TO A WORD THAT HAD THREE SYLLABLES I WOULD SAY THE WORD THAT HAD TWO SYLLABLES PRETTY SIMPLE BUT I DID THAT MORE THAN MY PARENTS AND THE REASON I DID THIS WASN'T BECAUSE IT WAS EASIER I JUST COULDN'T SAY IT SO I WOULD SUBSTITUTE WITH EASIER WORDS TO SAY
NEVER REALLY LEARNT THAT BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
SHE MADE ME SAY THIS BUT I NEVER COULDN'T SAY IT SO I WOULD GO HOME WHERE SHE TOLD ME TO PRACTICE THIS BUT I WOULDN'T I WOULD GO HOME AND GO TO MY BEST FRIEND THE THESAURUS BECAUSE THEY HAD THE ANSWER TO WHAT I LACKED THE WORDS I COULD SAY BUT MEANT THE SAME THING SO THAT EXACT SAME THING YOU SAID THAT'S HOW I FEEL WHEN I WAS SPEAKING ENGLISH
SO I SUBSTITUTED THAT IT BECAME SALLY HUSTLES SEASHELLS ON THE BEACH
I CAN ONLY LISTEN FOR SO LONG BEFORE I GET BORED AND WHEN I GET BORED I WAS COMBING THIS GIRL'S HAIR IN FRONT OF ME LIKE A PERSIAN CAT {LG}
A TYPICAL CAR SALESMAN BUT I HAD HUGE RUNNING CURVE TO GO THROUGH I WASN'T THE LOUDEST ONE AT THE CAR DEALERSHIP BUT I DID TALK THE MOST IF YOU GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ASKED WHO TALKED THE MOST WITHOUT SKIPPING BEAT EVERYONE THERE WOULD SAY MY NAME
AND FROM THIS PROCESS OF THIS CONTINUING WITH THESE FLAWS WITH THIS GETTING OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE EVEN STANDING UP HERE GETTING OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE I'VE REALIZED THAT SOMETHING THAT I VIEWED AS A WEAKNESS SOMETHING I AVOIDED SOMETHING I'VE BEEN RUNNING AWAY FROM
I HIT IT STRAIGHTFORWARD I SOLVED THAT PROBLEM BY TURNING THAT WEAKNESS INTO A STRENGTH
I RAN
THERE WAS SOMETHING WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE PROBLEM AT HAND BUT ENJOYED RUNNING SO IN MY FIFTH GRADE
MY SCHOOL PUT ON A PRIZE WHOEVER RAN THE MOST MILES GETS THE PRIZE AND I THOUGHT SUBCONSCIOUSLY IF I RUN THE MOST MILES I WILL GET THE PRIZE AND I WILL EARN THE RESPECT OF THESE KIDS THAT TEASE ME WELL I RAN THE MOST MILES I GOT THE PRIZE I GOT SOME RESPECT BUT THAT DIDN'T CHANGE MY SPEAKING I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THE PROBLEM
IT WASN'T UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL WHEN
SOMEONE SAID ASLAN
IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE COMFORT ZONE
AND I DID THAT EXACT THING
{NS} TEDX IS ALL ABOUT SPREADING IDEAS BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD AN IDEA AND YOU WANTED TO COMMUNICATE IT WITH THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU BUT YOU KNEW WHEN YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH THE WORDS WOULDN'T COME
PHASE AS MY PARENTS CALLED IT BECAME EVIDENT WHEN I WAS IN PRESCHOOL BECAUSE IN PRESCHOOL THERE IS A MOMENT WHICH MY PARENTS WOULD NEVER LET ME LIVE DOWN THE TEACHER HAD EVEN CALLED MY PARENTS AND TOLD THEM TO COME IN THE
THERE'S NO OVERLAP THE SOUNDS ARE DIFFERENT IT'S A COMPLETE NEW WORLD
THE
ONLY PERSON THAT SPEAKS ENGLISH IN MY HOUSEHOLD IS THE
TV MY DAD
CAME HERE BEFORE SO HE WAS MY ROLE MODEL I LOOKED UP TO HIM BECAUSE HE COULD SPEAK IT THE BEST
WHEN IT CAME TO ME STAYING AT HOME I JUST WATCHED TV GRASPED A LITTLE BIT OF ENGLISH HERE AND THERE BUT I DIDN'T REALLY
SPEAK IT
WITH OTHER MOLECULES LIKE THAT PURPLE ONE SITTING THERE UNKNOWN ALSO THE
DOES YOUR HEART REALLY SUPPLY ALL THE ENERGY THAT'S NECESSARY FOR DRIVING THIS EVENT
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS A SURPRISE WE FOUND THAT IF WE TAKE A HOLLOW TUBE MADE OF HYDROPHILIC MATERIAL JUST LIKE A STRAW AND WE PUT THE STRAW IN THE WATER
AROUND EACH ONE OF THESE IS EZ WATER NOW THE EZ WATER IS NEGATIVELY CHARGED THE REGION BEYOND IS POSITIVELY CHARGED
ACTUALLY THE REASON THAT THESE AEROSOL DROPLETS COME TOGETHER IS BECAUSE OF THIS OPPOSITE CHARGE SO THE DROPLETS FROM THE AIR SIMILARLY CHARGED
TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO FREEZE IT HOW TO PRESERVE IT HOW TO AVOID DEHYDRATION WE MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE NATURE OF WATER AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL USES THERE'S
YOU NEED IT MOST IS WHERE THE SUN SHINES THE MOST IN DRY AREAS SO THE ENERGY FOR DOING ALL THIS IS AVAILABLE FREELY AVAILABLE TO DO IT
TO ITS NORMAL SIZE SO THIS BATTERY IS BASICALLY CHARGED BY
MANY EXPERIMENTS TO SHOW THAT THE ENERGY FOR BUILDING THIS COMES FROM LIGHT IT COMES NOT ONLY FROM THE DIRECT LIGHT BUT ALSO INDIRECT LIGHT WHAT DO I MEAN BY INDIRECT LIGHT
PROBABLY ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE TWO THIRDS WATER
YOU DO DON'T YOU
RIGHT
BUT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT BECAUSE
THE WATER MOLECULE IS SO SMALL THAT TWO THIRDS TRANSLATES INTO 99
OF YOUR MOLECULES THINK OF IT 99 PERCENT OF YOUR MOLECULES ARE
WATER
SO YOUR SHOES ARE CARRYING AROUND A BLOB OF WATER ESSENTIALLY NOW THE QUESTION IS IN YOUR CELLS DO THOSE WATER MOLECULES
THAT WOULD CREATE OR NUCLEATE THIS KIND OF ZONE NOT JUST GELS BUT WE FOUND THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY WATER LOVING OR SO CALLED HYDROPHILIC SURFACE COULD DO EXACTLY THAT CREATING THE EZ WATER
AND THE PLANT CONVERTS IT TO CHEMICAL ENERGY THE LIGHT ENERGY TO CHEMICAL ENERGY AND THE CHEMICAL ENERGY IS THEN USED TO DO GROWTH AND METABOLISM AND BENDING
AND WHAT HAVE YOU THAT WE ALL KNOW IT'S VERY COMMON WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU FROM OUR
YEARS AGO EXACTLY PROFESSED THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY A FOURTH PHASE OF WATER AND THIS WATER
THE SUBURBAN STREETS OF MINTO BECOME THE STAGE FOR PERFORMANCES CREATED BY INTERNATIONAL ARTISTS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PEOPLE OF MINTO WHAT WAS THIS PLACE CALLED
ARE RADICALLY OPEN THEY CAN TRANSFORM CITIES AND COMMUNITIES TO
WAS EMERGING AND THESE FESTIVALS WERE REALLY DIFFERENT THEY'RE OPEN THESE FESTIVALS BECAUSE LIKE IN MINTO THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE
THE CULTURE AND CAPITAL ACCELERATED THE INTERNET BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER HIGH AND LOW KIND OF DISAPPEARED A NEW KIND OF FESTIVAL EMERGED THE OLD FESTIVALS
REPRESENTS A NEW KIND OF 21ST CENTURY ARTS FESTIVAL
THAN A PASSIVE SPECTATOR AND THEY'RE OPEN BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IMAGINATION CANNOT BE CONTAINED IN BUILDINGS AND SO MUCH OF THE WORK THEY
US INTO THAT BUILDING THAT WE PASS EVERY DAY BUT WE NEVER WENT INTO AN ARTIST I THINK CAN REALLY SHOW US PEOPLE THAT WE MIGHT OVERLOOK IN OUR
FESTIVAL IT ASKS THE AUDIENCE TO PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN SHAPING THE PERFORMANCE
INTO ITS OWN FESTIVALS PROMOTE DIVERSITY THEY BRING NEIGHBORS INTO DIALOGUE THEY INCREASE CREATIVITY THEY OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR
AS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT IN 1947 THE EDINBURGH FESTIVAL WAS BORN AND AVIGNON WAS BORN AND HUNDREDS OF OTHERS WOULD FOLLOW IN THEIR
FESTIVALS WERE BORN IN THE RUBBLE OF WORLD WAR II CIVIC LEADERS CREATED THESE ANNUAL EVENTS TO
I HAD BEEN WAITING MY WHOLE LIFE TO GET TO SYDNEY I GOT TO THE AIRPORT TO THE HOTEL CHECKED IN AND SITTING THERE IN THE LOBBY WAS A BROCHURE FOR THE SYDNEY
CAN TAKE US TO A FAR FLUNG PART OF THE CITY THAT WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED
PEERED OUT THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT ALL THE NOISE AND COMMOTION WAS ABOUT AND HE
SO BRILLIANT ABOUT THE FESTIVALS THE NEW FESTIVALS IS THAT THEY ARE REALLY FULLY
TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THESE FESTIVALS ON THEIR CITIES BUT I'M MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN MANY MORE THINGS LIKE HOW A
IN THE GUARDIAN HAS WRITTEN THAT A GREAT FESTIVAL CAN SHOW US A MAP OF THE WORLD A MAP OF THE CITY AND A MAP OF OURSELVES
LAURIE ANDERSON AND MERCE CUNNINGHAM AND ROBERT LEPAGE WHO MADE WORK FOR THIS
SUBURBS AND MINTO LIES SOUTHWEST ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY
I HAVE TO SAY IT WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND FOR MY FIRST DAY DOWN UNDER I MEAN I'D THOUGHT ABOUT THE HARBOUR BRIDGE OR BONDI BEACH BUT MINTO
BUT STILL I'M A PRODUCER AND THE LURE OF A SITE SPECIFIC THEATER
HAVE MUCH MONEY
I DIDN'T THINK THAT SOMETHING AS BORING AS MONEY SHOULD GET IN THE WAY OF THIS DREAM THAT WAS BREWING IN MY HEAD I FIGURED THAT MORE IMPORTANT WAS JUST TO GET GOING AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHEN I SET OFF I THOUGHT IT WAS BEYOND ME BUT I DECIDED SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO PERSUADE MYSELF THAT FAILING WOULDN'T REALLY MATTER THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WOULD BE THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE OLD LOOK BACK IN MY LIFE AND REGRET NOT EVEN HAVING BEGUN SOMEHOW
FOR AN ALARMINGLY LARGE PROPORTION OF MY JOURNEY BEFORE I FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO MEND THE BIKE
HOME AGAIN FOR A NICE CUP OF TEA BY THE TIME I GOT HOME I HAD CYCLED 46000 MILES 72000 KM THROUGH 60 COUNTRIES 5 CONTINENTS I DID IT BY LIVING IN TENT EATING BANANA SANDWICHES THE WHOLE JOURNEY TOOK
WAS NEARLY AT THE END OF AFRICA THAT'S ONE CONTINENT DONE FROM AFRICA I JUMPED ON
ON AND ON I PEDALLED THROUGH ALL SORTS OF ADVENTURES INCREDIBLE
{LG} IN CASE YOU'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO NOT KNOW THE M25 THIS
THINK I WOULD EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OR POTENTIAL TO DO BUT I'VE CONTINUALLY SURPRISED MYSELF AT MY OWN POTENTIAL I'M A
AND I WANTED TO RIDE AS FAR AS I COULD TO THE ARCTIC OCEAN IN NORTHERN ALASKA I RODE THROUGH THE
THREE YEARS {LG} AND ONE THING THAT I'D CONTINUOUSLY COME UP AGAINST IN THE THREE YEARS WAS THIS WIMPISH NEGATIVITY OF PEOPLE PEOPLE'S DEFAULT SETTINGS SEEM TO BE QUITE
AND IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS LIVING ADVENTUROUSLY AND IT SEEMED TO MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT
ENORMOUS ESPECIALLY FOR AN ENGLISH GUY TRYING TO GRASP THE SIZE OF FIRES THIS FIRE IS THE SIZE OF WALES THE FIREMEN SAID TO ME SORRY THIS FIRE IS GOING TO BE BURNING FOR WEEKS NO WAY YOU CAN CARRY ON BY NOW I'VE BEEN
PLACES THAT WERE SO INCREDIBLE THAT THEY REMINDED ME ALTHOUGH THIS JOURNEY WAS VERY DIFFICULT I SPENT LOT OF MY TIME FEELING VERY SORRY FOR MYSELF AND WANTING TO GO HOME AND WATCH TV AND SIT ON THE SOFA
500 MILES 800 KM TILL I PASSED THE FOREST FIRE I COULD GET BACK ON THE BIKE AND CYCLE ALONG UP INTO ALASKA UP INTO THE
I WAS MAKING PROGRESS NOW BUT I WAS
ABOUT TO HEAD INTO SOMETHING THAT I WAS VERY NERVOUS ABOUT RIDING THROUGH SUDAN NORTHERN SUDAN THE NUBIAN DESERT I'D NEVER BEEN TO DESERT BEFORE
I'D BEEN TO A THE BEACH NOT IN A DESERT I WAS QUITE ALARMED THAT I MIGHT HAVE BITTEN OFF MORE
THAN I COULD CHEW I WAS RIDING ALONG WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IN THE DESERT I WAS GETTING VERY NERVOUS ONE DAY I HAD
AND THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL THE SCIENCE THE MATH THE GEOGRAPHY THE CREATIVE WRITING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY JUST THE SUBVERSIVE NOTION THAT THERE ARE OCEANS TO BE ROWED THERE ARE ADVENTURE TO HAVE THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO
A SMALL ADVENTURE A TINY ADVENTURE SO SMALL IT CAN BE A MICRO ADVENTURE ADVENTURE IS EVERYWHERE TO PROVE MY POINT I SET OUT TO HAVE THE MOST BORING ADVENTURE
THE OPEN ROAD IF YOU GET ON YOUR BIKE OUTSIDE YOUR FRONT DOOR AND YOU PEDAL IT'S AN INCREDIBLY SIMPLE CONCEPT YOU GET ON YOUR BIKE OUTSIDE YOU KEEP PEDALING AND
AND FELT LIKE A HEROIC EXPLORER FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE HAULING THIS SLEDGE THROUGH THE SNOWY WASTELAND OF RICKMANSWORTH
120 MILES LONG THROUGH COMMUTER SUBURBIA HELL EVERYONE HATES IT IF YOU CAN FIND
ME FROM THIS EXPERIENCE WAS THAT WHAT I REALLY LOVED WAS HAVING
TO INNOVATE AND BE CREATIVE AND TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT I DO THINGS THAT I WRITE NOW THAT'S SELF PUBLISHED IF THEY'RE GOOD IF IT'S RUBBISH THAT IS BECAUSE OF ME I LOVE THAT
TO DO THIS I HAD NO PARTICULAR SKILLS I'M NOT AN ATHLETE YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL I'M NO MUSCLE MAN I AM NOT EVEN A CYCLIST I AM JUST A DEPRESSINGLY NORMAL PERSON I
BEFORE THE ESSENCE OF MICRO ADVENTURES PERHAPS THE ESSENCE OF MY ENTIRE TALK
IN A SCHOOL FROM A TENT ON THE ARCTIC OCEAN AND THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE AGE YOU CAN INFLUENCE CHILDREN AT THERE
TO ABANDON MY HARD WON PUBLISHER GO BACK TO SELF PUBLISHING AND
ON INTO CANADA BRITISH COLUMBIA THE YUKON HEADING UP TO THE ARCTIC NOW
ADVENTURES FELT SO INTERESTING TO ME THAT I DECIDED THAT WAS GOING TO TAKE A BIT OF ACTION ON THIS I WAS GOING TO ENCOURAGE OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THEM I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO SPEND A WHOLE YEAR ONLY DOING MICRO ADVENTURES RIGHT HERE
BRICK WALL SIMPLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF STOPPING IT BECOMES SLIGHTLY MORE USEFUL IF YOU SHARE THIS WITH
THE LONG TORTUOUS JOURNEY TOWARDS GETTING BOOKS PUBLISHED WHICH IS A PAINFUL LONG PROCESS A YEAR OR TWO AGO I WAS ON A JOURNEY I WAS WALKING ACROSS SOUTHERN INDIA FROM COAST TO
IN THESE GREAT BOOKS OF PEOPLE CRYING WHEN THEY SAID GOODBYE TO THEIR MOMS
AROUND THE WORLD I READ THIS POEM ABOUT THE GOLDEN ROAD TO SAMARKAND AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THE MOST EXOTIC FAR OFF PLACE IMAGINABLE WE ARE THE PILGRIMS WE SHOULD GO ALWAYS A LITTLE FARTHER THOUGH WOW ONE DAY I
JOURNEY BUT WE THOUGHT NOTHING AFTER A LONG DAY HAULING SLEDGES TO
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS YEAR OF ADVENTURE WAS TO SHARE IT TO ENCOURAGE OTHER PEOPLE WHO'D NEVER
GET {NS} I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BE CHATTING
ANOTHER CONTINENT DOWN ALL I NEEDED TO DO IS TO CYCLE BACK THROUGH ASIA AND EUROPE AND BACK TO HOME
ASIA
I WAS GOING TO BEGIN IN SIBERIA DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT SIBERIA ALL I KNEW IS THAT IN WINTER IT'S VERY COLD THAT IS THE ICONIC IMAGE OF SIBERIA OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO TIME YOUR ARRIVAL THERE VERY CAREFULLY I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF I'M GOING TO SIBERIA
I WANT TO DO THE JOB RIGHT I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANY HALF MEASURE I TIMED MY ARRIVAL TO
UP THE NERVE TO GET ON MY BIKE AND SET OFF TO TRY AND RIDE AROUND THE WORLD I WAS INSPIRED BY ALL MY HEROES ALL THESE GREAT HEROIC EXPLORERS WHOSE BOOKS I READ ALL THE TIME
BUT
AS I SET OFF FROM HOME I REALIZED I WAS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THESE HEROIC EXPLORERS THERE IS NEVER
MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAY OF TELLING IT WHAT DO I LOVE I THOUGHT I KNOW I REALLY
AND DO THINGS THE WAY NATURE DOES WE COULD ACHIEVE FACTOR 10 FACTOR 100 MAYBE EVEN FACTOR 1000 SAVINGS IN RESOURCE AND ENERGY
PROJECT IS A FAIRLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW IDEAS FROM BIOLOGY CAN LEAD TO RADICAL INCREASES IN RESOURCE EFFICIENCY DELIVERING THE SAME FUNCTION
I'M TALKING ABOUT FIRSTLY BOTH THESE TECHNOLOGIES WORK VERY WELL IN HOT SUNNY DESERTS CSP NEEDS A SUPPLY OF DEMINERALIZED FRESHWATER THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE SEAWATER GREENHOUSE PRODUCES CSP PRODUCES A LOT OF WASTE HEAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF ALL THAT TO EVAPORATE MORE SEAWATER AND ENHANCE THE RESTORATIVE
AND I KNOW IT'S A QUIRKY EXAMPLE BUT I THINK THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ARE QUITE RADICAL BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY TRANSFORM A BIG PROBLEM WASTE INTO A MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY AND PARTICULARLY IN CITIES WE COULD LOOK AT THE WHOLE METABOLISM OF CITIES AND LOOK AT THOSE AS
INTO SCHEMES THAT CREATE VALUE AND JUST AS NATURAL SYSTEMS TEND TO INCREASE IN DIVERSITY AND RESILIENCE OVER
ECOSYSTEMS YOU'RE JUST AS LIKELY TO FIND EXAMPLES OF SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIPS SO AN IMPORTANT BIOMIMICRY PRINCIPLE IS TO FIND WAYS OF BRINGING TECHNOLOGIES TOGETHER IN SYMBIOTIC
100 SAVING AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE GOT INTO A POSITIVE CYCLE IN WHICH ONE BREAKTHROUGH FACILITATED
OF LIFE ON THE EARTH IT WAS THE COLONIZATION OF THE LAND BY PLANTS THAT HELPED CREATE THE BENIGN CLIMATE WE CURRENTLY ENJOY THE CONVERSE IS ALSO
RESOURCE CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT AND IN THAT SENSE VERY RELEVANT TO THE KIND OF CHALLENGES WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS NEXT FEW
IS SODIUM CHLORIDE YOU CAN ALSO COMPRESS THAT INTO A BUILDING BLOCK AS
BREEZE BLOWS IN OFF THE SEA YOU GET THESE DROPLETS OF WATER FORMING ON THE BEETLE'S SHELL JUST BEFORE SUNRISE HE TIPS HIS SHELL UP THE WATER RUNS DOWN INTO HIS MOUTH HAS A GOOD DRINK GOES OFF AND HIDES FOR THE REST
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE CAN INTERVENE AT THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS TO HALT OR MAYBE EVEN REVERSE
A LOT OF THAT HUMIDITY AS FRESHWATER IN A PROCESS THAT IS EFFECTIVELY IDENTICAL TO THE
WORKS VERY DIFFERENTLY IN ECOSYSTEMS THE WASTE FROM ONE ORGANISM BECOMES THE NUTRIENT FOR SOMETHING ELSE IN THAT
THE TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT USES VERY NEGATIVE LANGUAGE BUT HERE IT'S ABOUT SYNERGIES AND ABUNDANCE AND OPTIMIZING AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT
ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY ONCE SAID IF YOU WANT TO BUILD FLOTILLA OF SHIPS YOU DON'T SIT AROUND TALKING ABOUT CARPENTRY NO YOU NEED TO SET
OF THE RESOURCE INPUT AND ACTUALLY THERE ARE LOADS OF EXAMPLES IN NATURE THAT YOU COULD TURN TO FOR SIMILAR
THE SYSTEM TO CREATE MORE VALUE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT DIFFERENT THINGS CRYSTALLIZE OUT AT DIFFERENT STAGES WHEN YOU EVAPORATE SEAWATER THE FIRST THING TO CRYSTALLIZE OUT IS CALCIUM CARBONATE AND THAT BUILDS UP ON THE
TO DO IT AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE WITH RAW MATERIALS OF DEAD FLIES AND WATER IT DOES SUGGEST WE'VE STILL GOT A BIT TO
INCREASES IN RESOURCE EFFICIENCY CLOSING LOOPS AND A SOLAR ECONOMY THEY'RE NOT JUST POSSIBLE THEY'RE CRITICAL AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT STUDYING THE WAY NATURE SOLVES PROBLEMS WILL PROVIDE A LOT OF THE
AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE ORGANISMS THAT HAVE EVOLVED TO LIVE IN DESERTS THERE ARE SOME AMAZING EXAMPLES OF ADAPTATIONS TO WATER SCARCITY THIS IS THE NAMIBIAN FOG BASKING BEETLE AND IT'S EVOLVED WAY OF HARVESTING ITS OWN FRESH
ABOUT THIS STUFF IS YOU CAN MAKE IT IN UNITS OF ROUGHLY SEVEN TIMES THE SIZE OF GLASS AND IT WAS ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE WEIGHT OF DOUBLE GLAZING
KEEN TO SCALE THIS UP AND APPLY BIOMIMICRY IDEAS TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT NATURE OFTEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS BEING ALL ABOUT COMPETITION BUT
IT'S COOL AND HUMID WHICH MEANS THE PLANTS NEED LESS WATER TO GROW AND THEN AT THE BACK OF THE GREENHOUSE
ABLAZE WITH VISIONS OF EXPLORING DISTANT SHORES AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO LET'S BE POSITIVE AND LET'S MAKE PROGRESS WITH WHAT COULD BE THE MOST EXCITING PERIOD OF INNOVATION WE'VE EVER SEEN THANK YOU {NS}
ELEMENT OF THE PERIODIC TABLE IN SEAWATER SO IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO EXTRACT VALUABLE ELEMENTS LIKE LITHIUM FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE BATTERIES AND IN PARTS OF THE ARABIAN GULF
THIS ON THE LAND AROUND AND THE COMBINATION OF THAT AND THE ELEVATED HUMIDITY HAD QUITE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THE LOCAL
AND THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE DELIBERATELY TRIED TO MIMIC ECOSYSTEMS AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS CALLED THE CARDBOARD TO CAVIAR PROJECT BY GRAHAM
AT NATURE AS BEING LIKE A CATALOG OF PRODUCTS AND ALL OF THOSE HAVE BENEFITED FROM A 3 8 BILLION YEAR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
IT'S A VERY LOGICAL PLAN
BUT IT WAS NOT ALWAYS LIKE THIS
FOR MANY YEARS WE WERE JUST PROVIDING THEM WITH
ARTIFICIAL LIMBS
IT TOOK
QUITE MANY YEARS FOR THE PROGRAM TO BECOME WHAT IT IS NOW
BUT ONE DAY
SOMETHING HAPPENED
I WAS
COMING BACK FROM A BIG FOOD DISTRIBUTION IN A MOSQUE
WHERE TENS AND TENS OF PEOPLE WERE SQUATTING IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS
I WANTED TO GO HOME I WAS DRIVING
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO FORGET YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THINGS SO YOU JUST WANT TO GO TO YOUR ROOM TO LOCK YOURSELF INSIDE AND
SAY THAT'S ENOUGH
A BOMB FELL NOT FAR FROM MY CAR WELL FAR ENOUGH BUT BIG NOISE
AND
EVERYBODY DISAPPEARED FROM THE STREET THE CARS DISAPPEARED AS WELL
I DUCKED
AND
ONLY ONE FIGURE REMAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IT
WAS A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR
DESPERATELY TRYING TO
MOVE AWAY
THERE ARE PLENTY OF COUNTRIES AT WAR LIKE AFGHANISTAN IT IS POSSIBLE AND IT IS NOT DIFFICULT ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IN THE EVENING I WENT TO SPEAK WITH THE BOSSES AT THE HEADQUARTERS AND I TOLD THEM I LIED
I TOLD THEM LISTEN WE ARE GOING TO START
A COUPLE OF HOURS PER DAY JUST A FEW REPAIRS
MAYBE SOME OF THEM ARE HERE NOW
SO WE STARTED DOING SOME REPAIRS
ALSO ONE OF THE PHYSICAL THERAPISTS REPORTED THAT
MAHMOUD COULD
BE PROVIDED WITH LEG BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY
THE LEGS WERE SWOLLEN AND THE KNEES WERE STIFF SO HE NEEDED A LONG PREPARATION
LEARNED A LOT FROM PEOPLE LIKE NAJMUDDIN MAHMOUD RAFI THEY ARE MY TEACHERS I HAVE A WISH A BIG WISH THAT THIS WAY OF WORKING
EMOTION IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT FROM THE PAST IT'S 21 YEARS BUT THEY ARE STILL ALL THERE ANYWAY
EVERYDAY TO WORK
FOR THE HOMELESS
AND NAJMUDDIN WAS STAYING THERE DOING EVERYTHING AND REPORTING ON THE PATIENTS HE WAS TELLING ME
PATIENTS ARE COMING
WE KNEW THAT
MANY MORE PATIENTS COULD NOT COME PREVENTED BY THE FIGHTING BUT PEOPLE WERE COMING
AND MAHMOUD WAS COMING EVERY DAY
AND SLOWLY SLOWLY WEEK
HIS LEGS WERE IMPROVING
THE
STUMP OR CAST
PROSTHESIS WAS MADE
AND HE WAS STARTING THE
REAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION
HE WAS COMING EVERY DAY CROSSING THE FRONT LINE
A COUPLE OF TIMES I CROSSED THE FRONT LINE IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE MAHMOUD AND HIS SON WERE CROSSING
I TELL YOU IT WAS SOMETHING SO SINISTER THAT
I WAS ASTONISHED HE COULD DO IT EVERY DAY
BUT FINALLY THE GREAT DAY ARRIVED
NOT TO BE A BEGGAR ANYMORE THAT WAS THE JOB
THE BEGINNING WHEN ANAJULINA TOLD ME
WE WOULD LIKE TO START IT
I HESITATED I SAID NO YOU CAN IMAGINE
I SAID NO NO NO NO WE CAN'T AND THEN I ASKED THE USUAL QUESTION
IS IT A PRIORITY
IS IT REALLY NECESSARY
WELL NOW YOU SHOULD SEE ME I NEVER MISS A SINGLE TRAINING SESSION
THE NIGHT BEFORE A MATCH I'M VERY NERVOUS
SOMETIMES WE WERE SUSPENDED FOR A FEW HOURS BUT WE NEVER
WE NEVER
CLOSED IT AGAIN
I MET MAHMOUD ONE YEAR LATER
HE WAS IN GOOD SHAPE
A BIT THINNER
HE NEEDED TO
CHANGE HIS PROSTHESES A NEW PAIR OF PROSTHESES
I ASKED ABOUT HIS SON HE TOLD ME HE'S AT SCHOOL HE'D DOING QUITE WELL
BUT
I UNDERSTOOD HE WANTED TO TELL ME SOMETHING
SO I
ASKED HIM WHAT IS THAT
HE WAS SWEATING
HE WAS CLEARLY EMBARRASSED
AND HE WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF
WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY STAY INDOORS
WITH ALL THESE SANDBAGS AT THE WINDOWS
VERY SAD
DARK SO WE
CHOSE A SMALL SPOT IN THE GARDEN AND MAHMOUD PUT ON HIS PROSTHESES THE OTHER
PATIENTS
DID THE SAME AND THEY STARTED
PRACTICING FOR THE LAST TIME BEFORE BEING DISCHARGED SUDDENLY
THEY STARTED FIGHTING
AND TO SCREW THE SOLE OF THE FEET WE NEED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION
EXCUSE ME
I COULD NOT BELIEVE
AND THEN HE SAID NO WE CAN MODIFY THE WORKBENCH
MAYBE TO PUT A SPECIAL STOOL A SPECIAL ANVIL SPECIAL
VICE AND MAYBE AN ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER I SAID LISTEN IT'S
INSANE
AND IT'S EVEN CRUEL TO THINK OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS THAT'S A PRODUCTION LINE AND A VERY FAST ONE
IT'S CRUEL TO
OFFER HIM A JOB
KNOWING THAT HE'S GOING TO FAIL
BUT WITH NAJMUDDIN WE CANNOT
DISCUSS
SO
THE ONLY THINGS I COULD MANAGE
TO OBTAIN WAS A KIND
OF
A COMPROMISE ONLY ONE WEEK
ONE WEEK TRY AND NOT A SINGLE DAY MORE
WILL GIVE HIM SOME MONEY AND SO THE FOLLOWING DAY I WENT TO THE ORTHOPEDIC CENTER
AND I SPOKE WITH A
GATEKEEPER I WAS READY TO TELL HIM LISTEN IF SOMEONE SUCH AND SUCH COMES TOMORROW PLEASE TELL HIM THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE NOTHING CAN BE DONE
GIVE HIM SOME MONEY BUT MAHMOUD AND HIS SON WERE ALREADY THERE
AND THEY WERE NOT ALONE
THERE WERE
15 MAYBE 20 PEOPLE LIKE HIM
WAITING
MAN WAS
WITHOUT LEGS
AND ONLY WITH ONE ARM
BEHIND HIM THERE WAS A CHILD HIS SON
RED IN THE FACE IN AN EFFORT
TO
PUSH THE FATHER
SO I TOOK HIM INTO A SAFE PLACE AND
I ASK WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT IN THE STREET IN THIS SITUATION
I WORK HE SAID
I WONDERED
WHAT WORK
AND THEN I ASK AN EVEN MORE STUPID QUESTION WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE PROSTHESES
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE ARTIFICIAL LEGS
AND HE SAID THE RED CROSS HAS CLOSED
WELL WITHOUT THINKING I TOLD HIM
COME TOMORROW
WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH A PAIR OF LEGS
THE MAN HIS NAME WAS MAHMOUD AND THE CHILD WHOSE NAME WAS RAFI
LEFT
AND THEN I SAID OH MY GOD WHAT DID I SAY
THE
CENTER IS CLOSED
NO STAFF AROUND
MAYBE THE MACHINERY IS BROKEN
WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THE LEGS FOR HIM
SO I HOPED THAT HE WOULD NOT COME
THIS
AND THEN OF COURSE TO ADAPT
THIS IS MY
BIG WISH
WELL DON'T THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN AFGHANISTAN ARE OVER NOT AT ALL WE ARE GOING ON RECENTLY WE HAVE JUST
STARTED A PROGRAM
A SPORT
21 YEARS I WORK FOR THE RED CROSS AND I'M A PHYSICAL THERAPIST
SAT MOMENT AND I HEARD
RAFI TELLING HIS FATHER
FATHER YOU CAN RUN FASTER THAN ME
AND MAHMOUD
OF COURSE I CAN
I CAN RUN AND NOW YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL
NO NEED OF STAYING WITH ME ALL THE DAY PUSHING MY WHEELCHAIR
LATER ON WE TOOK THEM HOME
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET MAHMOUD AND HIS SON
WALKING TOGETHER PUSHING THE EMPTY WHEELCHAIR
AND THEN I UNDERSTOOD
PHYSICAL REHABILITATION IS A PRIORITY
DIGNITY CANNOT WAIT FOR BETTER TIMES
THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS NEW TO ME BUT IT WAS A TERRIFIC
AND
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY EVERYBODY BENEFITS FROM THAT
THOSE EMPLOYED OF COURSE
BECAUSE THEY GET A JOB
AND DIGNITY
BUT ALSO FOR THE NEWCOMERS THEY ARE 7000 EVERY YEAR
PEOPLE COMING FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND YOU SHOULD SEE THE FACES OF THESE PEOPLE WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT THOSE ASSISTING THEM ARE LIKE THEM SOMETIMES YOU SEE THEM THEY LOOK
OH
AND YOU SEE THE FACES AND
THEN
THE SURPRISE TURNS INTO HOPE
AND IT'S EASY FOR ME AS WELL TO TRAIN SOMEONE
WHO HAS ALREADY PASSED THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF DISABILITY POOF THEY LEARN MUCH FASTER THE MOTIVATION THE EMPATHY THEY CAN ESTABLISH WITH THE PATIENT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COMPLETELY
SCRAPS OF MEN DO NOT EXIST
PEOPLE LIKE MAHMOUD
ARE AGENTS OF CHANGE
AND WHEN YOU START CHANGING YOU CANNOT STOP
MY CHILDREN ARE GROWING
I FEEL ASHAMED
I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE TEASED
AT SCHOOL
BY THE OTHER STUDENTS
I SAID OKAY I THOUGHT HOW MUCH MONEY DO I HAVE IN MY POCKET
JUST TO GIVE HIM SOME MONEY IT WAS THE EASIEST WAY
HE READ MY MIND
AND HE SAID
I ASK FOR A JOB
AND THEN HE ADDED SOMETHING
I WILL NEVER FORGET FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
HE SAID
I AM SCRAP OF A MAN
BUT IF YOU HELP ME
I'M READY TO DO ANYTHING
EVEN IF I HAVE TO CRAWL ON THE GROUND
AND THEN HE SAT DOWN I SAT DOWN TOO WITH GOOSEBUMPS EVERYWHERE
LEGLESS
WITH
ONLY ONE ARM
ILLITERATE
UNSKILLED
WHAT
JOB FOR HIM
WHAT'S NEXT WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT CHANGE WELL I DON'T KNOW YET BUT I'M SURE NAJMUDDIN AND HIS FRIENDS THEY HAVE IT ALREADY IN MIND THAT WAS MY STORY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT I WAS WRONG AGAIN
MAHMOUD HAD LOOKED TALLER I REMEMBER HIM SITTING BEHIND THE WORKBENCH
SMILING
HE WAS A NEW MAN
TALLER AGAIN
OF COURSE I
UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT
MADE HIM
STAND TALL
YEAH THEY WERE THE LEGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT AS A FIRST STEP
IT WAS THE DIGNITY
HE HAS REGAINED HIS FULL DIGNITY THANKS TO THAT JOB
SO OF COURSE I UNDERSTOOD AND THEN
WE STARTED A NEW POLICY A NEW POLICY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WE DECIDED TO EMPLOY AS MANY
DISABLED AS POSSIBLE TO TRAIN THEM IN ANY POSSIBLE JOB
THE GATEKEEPER TOLD ME THEY COME EVERYDAY TO SEE IF THE CENTER WILL OPEN
I SAID NO WE HAVE TO GO AWAY WE CANNOT STAY HERE THEY WERE BOMBING NOT VERY CLOSE BUT YOU COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF THE BOMBS SO WE CANNOT STAY HERE IT'S DANGEROUS
IT'S NOT PRIORITY
BUT NAJMUDDIN TOLD ME LISTEN NOW WE'RE HERE
AT LEAST WE CAN START REPAIRING THE PROSTHESES THE BROKEN PROSTHESES OF THE PEOPLE AND MAYBE TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR
PEOPLE LIKE MAHMOUD I
ARRIVED IN AFGHANISTAN IN 1990 TO WORK IN A HOSPITAL FOR WAR VICTIMS
ABOUT MY OWN HUMANITY I QUESTIONED
AND THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MY DRIVE FROM MARINA DEL REY BACK TO WATTS IN SOUTH
SO THE MESSAGE I'M COMING HERE TODAY AND THIS IS FOR MY BROTHERS WHO ARE IN BLUE THIS IS FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE HOME
THE SIMPLE RIGHT TO JUST DREAM OF A DREAM
IN THE WORDS OF OBAMA ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN THE SMALLNESS OF POLITICS AND THAT ACTUALLY WE COME TOGETHER AS A UNITED WHOLE AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT WILL WE ACTUALLY SEE CHANGE
WAS DREAMING AND I WAS DREAMING BIG AS BIG AS COULD BE AND THEN MY DREAMS WERE FORTUNATELY INTERRUPTED
SO THAT THEY CAN DREAM AGAIN THE SUCCESSES THAT I'VE HAD IN MY OWN MIND ARE MARGINAL
ME A HIGH AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DREAM OF IDEAS TO BUILD
TELL ME ABOUT THE CHILD WHO BELIEVES THAT YES HE CAN MAKE MONEY BUT THE ONLY REASON HE WANTS TO IS TO ACTUALLY AFFECT THE OVERALL SOCIETY
THEN I WAS LIKE WELL AESTHETICALLY IT'S NOT NICE I GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AS AN ENGINEER AND I'M PAID TO DREAM
THAT LED US TO CREATE A CAMP PROGRAM WHERE WE BROUGHT FOUR MAJOR HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE AREA TOGETHER AND THE WHOLE FOCUS WAS TO BRING THESE KIDS TOGETHER TO
WE BEGIN TO LEARN TO DREAM AND DREAM AS BIG AS POSSIBLE NO MATTER IF SOMEONE
TO DREAM DID NOT START WHEN I WALKED INTO PRISON
FAILURE THAN TO REST IN THAT GRAY SPACE THAT KNOWS NOT VICTORY NOR DEFEAT DARE TO DREAM AGAIN PLEASE THANK YOU
AND AS TREES TURNED INTO LIQUOR STORES INTO GRAFFITI AND IT REMINDED ME OF MY DAYS WHEN I SAT IN THIS EXACT SAME PRISON
YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION
NOT ONLY TO YOURSELVES
BUT TO OUR CHILDREN
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE CHILD
CAN DREAM AGAIN
THAT IS YOUR OBLIGATION IN LIFE
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR STATURE YOUR TITLE
YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
TELL ME ABOUT THE CHILD
WHO BELIEVES HE CAN BE AN ENGINEER
{NS} EIGHT YEARS AGO I WAS IN THIS VERY SAME PRISON THIS
TO DARE MIGHTY TASK ALTHOUGH
AS FRIENDS AT LEAST THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT TO BEGIN TO REBUILD
DREAM BEYOND THE BARS AND HAVE MENTORS THAT HELPED ME SEE THAT
AND WE ALLOW CHILDREN TO BEGIN TO SEE THEMSELVES AND SEE WHO THEY COULD BE AND WHO THEY REALLY ARE AND
AND THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME
THAT ALL OUR COLLECTIVE SERVICES
ARE NOT ABOUT THIS ONE
PIECE OF SERVICE THAT WE GIVE TO OUR SUBJECTS OUR KIDS THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE HELPING BUT IN FACT WE'RE CREATING AN OVERALL FAR STRETCHING
BUT I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS AND IT'S A QUOTE THAT I LIVE BY
AND IMPOSSIBLE YOU HAVE TO DREAM IT AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE ALLOW
THAT THE CHILDREN IN AREAS SUCH AS WATTS AND COMPTON THE
WHAT WAS IT THAT HAD STRIPPED THAT COURAGE
OF MY FEARS
AND FIND THEIR ORIGIN I DECIDED TO CLASSIFY THEM ACCORDING
TO A STACK OF VALUES VALUES THAT DEFINE WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE DO THE THINGS THAT WE DO AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY SVA PROFESSOR DR TOM GUARRIELLO
WE'RE ALL BORN WITH A SET OF UNIVERSAL VALUES AND LITTLE BY LITTLE WE DEVELOP
ULTIMATELY CHANGE OUR APPROACH TO LIFE ITSELF IN MY CASE I WENT FROM NO THANKS
REPEAT THEMSELVES OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY
OUR FEARS AS A WAY TO PURSUE OUR DREAMS AND OPEN OURSELVES TO EXPERIENCES THAT WE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED BY DAY
TRIED ACUPUNCTURE I JUMPED OFF A CLIFF AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT REASSURED ME THAT INDEED I DON'T LIKE PAIN BUT HEY I
NOT EVEN ONE TIME THE ACTUAL CHALLENGE WAS WORSE THAN WHAT I HAD IN MY HEAD BEFORE SO WTF ARE WE SO
FACE THAT FEAR GIVE IT A SHOT AND THEN SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE INSPIRE
FELL UNDER THE CULTURAL STACK SOCIETY SHAPES US AND GIVES US GUIDELINES SO ONE DAY WE ALL BECOME WELL BEHAVED RATIONAL ADULTS
EVEN EMPATHY FROM ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
YOU CAN SURVIVE IT I KNOW IT'S HARD IT MAY NOT BE PAINLESS QUICK OR EASY BUT YOU CAN INSIST ON A DIFFERENT ENDING TO YOUR STORY
GOSSIP WEBSITE HAD OVER FIVE MILLION HITS FOR THIS ONE STORY
THE TYLER CLEMENTI FOUNDATION IN THE U S IN THE U K THERE'S ANTI
BRILLIANT PEOPLE ALL UNDER THE AGE OF 30 THAT MEANT THAT IN 1998
A MARKETPLACE HAS EMERGED WHERE PUBLIC HUMILIATION IS A COMMODITY AND SHAME IS AN INDUSTRY
I KNOW RIGHT HE WAS CHARMING AND I WAS FLATTERED AND I DECLINED
THERE ARE NO PERIMETERS AROUND HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN PUBLICLY OBSERVE YOU AND PUT YOU IN A PUBLIC STOCKADE
RESEARCHER BREN BROWN SAID AND I QUOTE SHAME CAN'T SURVIVE EMPATHY SHAME CANNOT SURVIVE EMPATHY
WHEN WE BEGAN VALUING SUSTAINABILITY MORE PEOPLE BEGAN TO RECYCLE
AMPLIFIED UNCONTAINED AND PERMANENTLY ACCESSIBLE
NEWS SOURCES PLASTERED PHOTOS OF ME ALL OVER TO SELL NEWSPAPERS BANNER ADS ONLINE AND TO KEEP PEOPLE TUNED TO THE TV
RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION BUT WE NEED TO TALK MORE ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WE ALL WANT TO BE HEARD BUT LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIFFERENCE
EVEN YOUR BOSS UNLIKE ME THOUGH YOUR BOSS PROBABLY WASN'T THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AND EMAILS RELATED TO CYBERBULLYING A META ANALYSIS DONE OUT OF THE NETHERLANDS SHOWED THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME CYBERBULLYING WAS
THIS SHIFT HAS CREATED WHAT PROFESSOR NICOLAUS MILLS CALLS A CULTURE OF
GOSSIP WEBSITES PAPARAZZI REALITY PROGRAMMING POLITICS NEWS OUTLETS AND SOMETIMES HACKERS ALL TRAFFIC IN SHAME IT'S LED TO DESENSITIZATION AND PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT
CONSIDER A FEW PROMINENT EXAMPLES JUST FROM THE PAST SIX MONTHS ALONE
AND THEN EVENTUALLY I REALIZED SHE WAS RELIVING 1998
ANYONE WHO IS SUFFERING FROM SHAME AND PUBLIC HUMILIATION NEEDS TO KNOW ONE THING
A SHOW OF HANDS OF ANYONE HERE WHO DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE
I THEN BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE WORLD OF HUMILIATION AND BULLYING AROUND ME AND SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
IN THE ONLINE WORLD WE CAN FOSTER MINORITY INFLUENCE BY BECOMING
AND EMPATHY ONLINE WE'VE GOT A COMPASSION DEFICIT AN EMPATHY CRISIS
IT WAS BEFORE SOCIAL MEDIA BUT PEOPLE COULD STILL COMMENT ONLINE EMAIL STORIES AND OF
IN 1998 WE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE THIS BRAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED THE INTERNET WOULD TAKE US
OR PHOTOS AND THEN MAKING THEM PUBLIC
I'VE SEEN SOME VERY DARK DAYS IN MY LIFE AND IT WAS THE COMPASSION AND EMPATHY FROM MY FAMILY FRIENDS PROFESSIONALS AND SOMETIMES EVEN STRANGERS THAT SAVED ME
BUT THE DARKNESS CYBERBULLYING AND SLUT SHAMING THAT I EXPERIENCED HAD MUSHROOMED
SINCE THEN IT HAS CONNECTED PEOPLE IN UNIMAGINABLE WAYS JOINING LOST SIBLINGS SAVING LIVES LAUNCHING REVOLUTIONS
BUT IN THIS CULTURE OF HUMILIATION THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF PRICE TAG ATTACHED TO PUBLIC SHAMING THE PRICE DOES NOT MEASURE THE COST TO THE VICTIM WHICH TYLER AND TOO MANY
RELIVING A TIME WHEN SHE SAT BY MY BED EVERY NIGHT RELIVING A
AS FAR AS OUR CULTURE OF HUMILIATION GOES WHAT WE NEED IS A CULTURAL REVOLUTION
WITH PAIN IN A WAY THAT I JUST COULDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
AND 100000 PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS PHOTOS AND VIDEOS WERE LEAKED ONLINE TO NOW HAVE A LIFESPAN OF FOREVER
AT THE AGE OF 41 I WAS HIT ON BY A 27 YEAR OLD GUY
MAINLY BY YOUNGER GENERATIONS AND CLAIMS THAT ITS MESSAGES ONLY HAVE THE LIFESPAN OF A FEW SECONDS
THAT I'M NOT REMINDED OF MY MISTAKE AND I REGRET THAT MISTAKE DEEPLY
THAT MEANT WE COULD ACCESS ALL THE INFORMATION WE WANTED WHEN WE WANTED IT ANYTIME
I WAS BRANDED
AS A TRAMP
TART
SLUT
WHORE
BIMBO
AND OF COURSE THAT WOMAN
I WAS SEEN BY MANY
BUT ACTUALLY KNOWN BY FEW
PUBLIC SHAMING AS A BLOOD SPORT HAS TO STOP AND IT'S TIME FOR AN INTERVENTION ON THE INTERNET AND IN OUR CULTURE
THE TOP NOTE ANSWER WAS AND IS BECAUSE IT'S TIME
WAS IT BUT THAT WASN'T MY FATE INSTEAD THIS SCANDAL WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION
LEGAL AND MEDIA MAELSTROM LIKE WE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
A U K NONPROFIT THAT'S FOCUSED ON HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE ON VARIOUS ISSUES RELEASED A STAGGERING STATISTIC LATE LAST YEAR
WE'RE IN A DANGEROUS CYCLE
THE MORE WE CLICK ON THIS KIND OF GOSSIP
THE MORE NUMB WE GET TO THE HUMAN LIVES BEHIND IT
AND THE MORE NUMB WE GET
THE MORE WE CLICK
ALL THE WHILE SOMEONE IS MAKING MONEY OFF OF THE BACK OF SOMEONE ELSE'S SUFFERING
CONSISTENCY OVER TIME CHANGE CAN HAPPEN
A CLICK THAT REVERBERATED AROUND THE WORLD WHAT THAT MEANT FOR ME PERSONALLY
PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON OVER 40 WHO DOES NOT WANT TO BE 22 AGAIN
THE RANGE OF CONTENT THAT THAT GETS A THIRD PARTY APP WHICH SNAPCHATTERS USE TO PRESERVE THE LIFESPAN OF THE MESSAGES WAS HACKED
TRUST ME COMPASSIONATE COMMENTS HELP ABATE THE NEGATIVITY
THE ECHO OF EMBARRASSMENT USED TO EXTEND ONLY AS FAR AS YOUR FAMILY VILLAGE SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY BUT NOW IT'S THE ONLINE COMMUNITY
IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS THE QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKED THE MOST IS WHY WHY NOW WHY WAS I STICKING MY HEAD ABOVE THE PARAPET YOU CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES IN THOSE QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS
WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE ONLINE WITH COMPASSION CONSUME NEWS WITH COMPASSION AND CLICK WITH COMPASSION JUST IMAGINE WALKING A MILE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HEADLINE
CRUELTY TO OTHERS IS NOTHING NEW BUT ONLINE TECHNOLOGICALLY ENHANCED SHAMING
IN 1998 I LOST MY REPUTATION AND MY DIGNITY I LOST ALMOST EVERYTHING
THERE IS A VERY PERSONAL PRICE TO PUBLIC HUMILIATION AND THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET HAS JACKED UP THAT PRICE
AND BY THIS I MEAN THE STEALING OF PEOPLE'S PRIVATE WORDS
HE COULD MAKE ME FEEL 22 AGAIN
FROM 2012 TO 2013 THERE WAS AN 87 PERCENT INCREASE
AND IN AUSTRALIA THERE'S PROJECT ROCKIT
TOO MANY HAVE LEARNED OF THEIR CHILD'S SUFFERING AND HUMILIATION AFTER IT WAS TOO LATE
AND PUBLIC WITHOUT COMPASSION
FAST FORWARD 12 YEARS TO 2010 AND
NOW SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BEEN BORN
THE LANDSCAPE HAS SADLY BECOME MUCH MORE POPULATED WITH INSTANCES LIKE
PRICE MEASURES THE PROFIT OF THOSE WHO PREY ON THEM THIS INVASION OF OTHERS IS A RAW MATERIAL EFFICIENTLY AND RUTHLESSLY MINED PACKAGED AND SOLD AT A PROFIT
AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHOCKED ME ALTHOUGH IT SHOULDN'T HAVE WAS OTHER RESEARCH LAST YEAR THAT DETERMINED HUMILIATION WAS A MORE INTENSELY FELT EMOTION THAN EITHER HAPPINESS OR EVEN ANGER
PUBLIC WITHOUT CONSENT PUBLIC WITHOUT CONTEXT
TYLER'S TRAGIC SENSELESS DEATH WAS A TURNING POINT FOR ME IT SERVED TO RECONTEXTUALIZE MY EXPERIENCES
WITH EVERY CLICK WE MAKE A CHOICE THE MORE WE SATURATE OUR CULTURE WITH PUBLIC SHAMING THE MORE ACCEPTED IT IS THE MORE WE WILL SEE BEHAVIOR LIKE CYBERBULLYING TROLLING SOME FORMS OF HACKING
HAVE COMPASSION FOR YOURSELF WE ALL DESERVE COMPASSION
THE SHIFT BEGINS WITH SOMETHING SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT EASY WE NEED TO RETURN TO A LONG HELD VALUE OF COMPASSION
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT DEVELOPMENTALLY EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THIS ARE SO ABUSED AND
A BERET
NOW I ADMIT I MADE MISTAKES
ESPECIALLY WEARING THAT BERET BUT
THE ATTENTION AND JUDGMENT THAT I RECEIVED NOT THE STORY
BUT THAT I PERSONALLY RECEIVED WAS UNPRECEDENTED
EVERY DAY ONLINE PEOPLE
ONLINE HARASSMENT WHY BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE HUMILIATION AT THEIR CORES
DEEPLY DEEPLY ASHAMED TO THE WORST VERSION OF MYSELF A SELF I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE {NS} A FEW DAYS LATER THE STARR REPORT IS RELEASED TO CONGRESS
WE CAN ALSO COUNTERACT THE CULTURE BY SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF
PRIVATE EMAILS THAT HAD MAXIMUM PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT VALUE
LOOKING AT A WOMAN WHO WAS PUBLICLY SILENT FOR A DECADE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S CHANGED BUT ONLY RECENTLY
AND CYBERBULLYING IGNITED A FEW DAYS LATER TYLER JUMPED FROM THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE TO HIS DEATH
AND TO LIVE BOTH ONLINE AND OFF IN A MORE COMPASSIONATE WORLD THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
TODAY I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THAT EXPERIENCE HAS HELPED SHAPE MY CULTURAL OBSERVATIONS
LISTEN TO MY SOMETIMES CATTY SOMETIMES CHURLISH SOMETIMES SILLY SELF
A FEW YEARS EARLIER NEWS WAS CONSUMED FROM JUST THREE PLACES READING A NEWSPAPER OR MAGAZINE LISTENING TO THE RADIO OR WATCHING TELEVISION
OR NOT SOMEONE ACTUALLY MAKE A MISTAKE AND NOW IT'S FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PEOPLE
THE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME HAVE BECOME DIRE
VERY DIRE
I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY MOM IN SEPTEMBER OF 2010 AND
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS OF A YOUNG COLLEGE FRESHMAN FROM RUTGERS UNIVERSITY NAMED TYLER CLEMENTI
CHANGING BEHAVIOR BEGINS WITH EVOLVING BELIEFS
WE'VE SEEN THAT TO BE TRUE WITH RACISM HOMOPHOBIA AND PLENTY OF OTHER BIASES TODAY AND IN THE PAST
AS WE'VE CHANGED BELIEFS ABOUT SAME SEX MARRIAGE MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OFFERED
EQUAL FREEDOMS
CAN'T IMAGINE LIVING TO THE NEXT DAY AND SOME TRAGICALLY DON'T
OF TAPED CONVERSATION FOR THE PAST EIGHT
CONTENT OF THESE TAPES HAS HUNG LIKE THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES OVER MY HEAD I MEAN WHO CAN REMEMBER WHAT THEY SAID A YEAR AGO SCARED AND MORTIFIED
A PUBLICLY HUMILIATED ONE WORLDWIDE I WAS PATIENT ZERO OF LOSING A PERSONAL
CAN POST A POSITIVE COMMENT FOR SOMEONE OR REPORT A BULLYING
IT BROKE ONLINE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE TRADITIONAL NEWS WAS USURPED BY THE INTERNET FOR A MAJOR NEWS STORY
ENOUGH
BUT FEW WEEKS LATER
THE AUDIO TAPES ARE AIRED ON TV
AND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE
THE PUBLIC HUMILIATION
WAS EXCRUCIATING
LIFE WAS ALMOST UNBEARABLE
WHEN SHE MADE ME SHOWER WITH THE BATHROOM DOOR OPEN AND RELIVING A TIME WHEN BOTH OF MY PARENTS FEARED THAT I WOULD BE HUMILIATED TO DEATH LITERALLY
UNDERNEATH HUMMING FLUORESCENT LIGHTS
I'M LISTENING
TO THE SOUND OF MY VOICE
MY VOICE ON SURREPTITIOUSLY TAPED PHONE CALLS THAT A SUPPOSED FRIEND HAD MADE THE YEAR BEFORE
I'M HERE
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PERSONALLY AUTHENTICATE
ALL 20
SWEET SENSITIVE CREATIVE TYLER WAS SECRETLY WEBCAMMED BY HIS ROOMMATE WHILE BEING INTIMATE WITH ANOTHER MAN WHEN THE ONLINE WORLD LEARNED OF THIS INCIDENT
AND I GET IT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET THAT THAT WOMAN WAS DIMENSIONAL HAD A SOUL AND WAS ONCE UNBROKEN
THAT OVERNIGHT I WENT FROM BEING A COMPLETELY PRIVATE FIGURE
AT THE AGE OF 22 I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY BOSS AND AT THE AGE OF 24 I LEARNED THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES
OLDEST AMONG THE GROUP WERE ONLY 14 AND THE YOUNGEST JUST FOUR
LISTEN LISTEN AS I PRATTLE ON ABOUT THE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM OF THE DAY LISTEN AS I CONFESS MY LOVE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND OF
FASCINATING THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE PLACED IN THIS ROOM IT WAS FOUND THEY SHOCKED THEMSELVES WITH THAT LITTLE ELECTRIC SHOCKER AT LEAST ONCE AT LEAST ONCE
OUR COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW THIS FRIENDS I KNOW THIS BECAUSE INTENTIONAL SOLITUDE HAS BEEN A TURNING POINT IN MY LIFE NOW I USED TO BE A VERY NEGATIVE ANGRY AND STRESSED OUT INDIVIDUAL
DECADES OF RESEARCH HAVE SHOWN
THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY COLLABORATE IN A GROUP SETTING AND WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER ARE FAR LESS PRODUCTIVE THAN WHEN THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE GO OFF INDIVIDUALLY COME UP WITH IDEAS AND LATER COME TOGETHER TO COLLABORATE AND PULL THOSE IDEAS
YOU SEE EVEN IN THE WORKPLACE SOLITUDE FOSTERS INNOVATION AND THAT CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE SEE COLLABORATION
INTENTIONAL SOLITUDE
CAN BE A
WOULD IT BE A DANGEROUS UNPRODUCTIVE ANTISOCIAL PLACE OR WOULD IT BE SAFE INNOVATIVE AND EVEN INCLUSIVE
AND JUST SITTING THERE WITH MY EYES SHUT OR OPEN OR JUST YOU KNOW ROLLING OR WHATEVER FOR FOUR FIVE SIX MINUTES IT MAY SEEM LIKE 15 20 25 AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD THING
YOU KNOW I FEEL CALMER
I FEEL LIKE
I'M FREED FROM THE EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS I'VE EXPERIENCED LESS STRESS FROM THINGS LIKE SCHOOL AND WORK
YOU KNOW SO YOU SEE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
OF THE DAY AND SAT THERE ALONE WITH ONLY YOUR THOUGHTS WAS IT THIS MORNING
WOULD HAPPEN IF WE WERE ALL LESS STRESSED OUT
WE'D
HAVE INCREASED
LIKE HAPPINESS IT WOULD FOSTER A MORE PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT WE'D BE MORE GENUINELY
JOYFUL AND KIND TO ONE ANOTHER
STRESS REDUCTION ISN'T THE ONLY BENEFIT OF INTENTIONAL
ALONE INDIVIDUALLY BUT WE'RE ALSO AFRAID OF THOSE AROUND US WHO WE SEE AS BEING ALONE WE'RE AFRAID OF OTHERS WHO APPEAR TO BE BY THEMSELVES
YOU KNOW WE SEE THEM AS DANGEROUS
UNPRODUCTIVE ANTISOCIAL OR MAYBE EVEN UNWANTED AND I THINK THAT'S SKEWED VIEW
SO WHY IS IT WHY IS IT THAT WE LOOK DOWN ON THESE PEOPLE
WHO ARE ALONE AND WHY ARE WE OURSELVES AFRAID OF BEING ALONE
BILLBOARDS SAY LAB SPACE AVAILABLE
AND IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN THESE 10 YEARS WE'VE WITNESSED
ABSOLUTELY THE START OF A SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION THAT OF GENOME MEDICINE
WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PATIENTS THAT ENTER OUR CLINIC NOW THAN EVER BEFORE AND WE'RE ABLE FINALLY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN SO PRESSING FOR SO MANY YEARS WHY DO I HAVE CANCER
THESE THREE PROTEINS HAVE ENTERED A SPACE IN THE LANGUAGE OF OUR FIELD THAT'S CALLED THE UNDRUGGABLE GENOME WHICH
BECAUSE NOW WE'VE SHARED THIS MOLECULE JUST SINCE DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR WITH 40 LABORATORIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND 30 MORE IN EUROPE
MIGHT MORE QUICKLY BRING POWERFUL AND TARGETED THERAPIES TO OUR
IDEA THAT PERHAPS BY LEARNING THE TRADE OF DISCOVERY CHEMISTRY AND APPROACHING IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD OF THE OPEN SOURCE THE CROWD SOURCE THE COLLABORATIVE NETWORK THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO WITHIN
{LG} WE BASICALLY TRIED TO CREATE THE MOST COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR LAB AS POSSIBLE AND THIS WAS UNFORTUNATELY
MIGHT FAIRLY ASK WHY IS THAT AND THE VERY UNSATISFYING YET SCIENTIFIC ANSWER IS IT'S TOO HARD THAT FOR
THAT IT'S CANCER AND THE REASON IS THAT CANCER LIKE EVERY CELL IN THE BODY PLACES LITTLE MOLECULAR
THIS MOLECULE INTO MICE THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THERE'S NO MOUSE MODEL OF THIS RARE CANCER AND SO AT THE
FOR YOU {LG} IN FACT THIS MOLECULE PREVENTS THIS
HAVE A SMALL LAB WE THOUGHT WE'D JUST SEND IT TO PEOPLE AND SEE HOW THE MOLECULE BEHAVES WE SENT IT TO OXFORD ENGLAND WHERE GROUP OF TALENTED
IT NOTES INVOLVE
THIS AND OTHER PROTEINS OF ITS CLASS SO CALLED BROMODOMAINS
SO WE DEVELOPED AN IDEA A RATIONALE THAT PERHAPS IF WE MADE A MOLECULE THAT PREVENTED THE POST IT NOTE FROM STICKING BY ENTERING INTO THE LITTLE POCKET AT THE BASE OF THIS SPINNING PROTEIN THEN
AND DRIVE IT ACROSS TOWN AND PUT IT INTO MICE AND TRY TO DO A CLINICAL TRIAL AT A STAGE THAT WITH A PROTOTYPE DRUG WELL THAT WOULD BE OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE AND RIGHTLY ILLEGAL TO DO IN HUMANS AND HE
CASCADING THROUGH THE REGULATORY NETWORK AT THE FDA WERE THESE
IN THE LAB ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE INTERACTION WITH THESE PATIENTS FEELS QUITE COMPELLED TO DELIVER A DRUG SUBSTANCE BASED ON THIS MOLECULE
IT MEANS IS THAT WE'VE FAILED TO IDENTIFY A GREASY POCKET IN THESE PROTEINS INTO WHICH WE LIKE MOLECULAR LOCKSMITHS CAN FASHION AN ACTIVE SMALL ORGANIC MOLECULE OR DRUG SUBSTANCE
IS QUITE DESIRABLE TO STUDY IN THAT INDUSTRY
BY FOUNDATIONS AND ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN BOSTON IS THAT YOU PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR CANCER AND I LOVE THAT
WITH AN INTEREST IN CANCER AND IN CHEMISTRY YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT CHEMISTRY IS THE SCIENCE OF MAKING MOLECULES OR TO MY TASTE NEW DRUGS FOR CANCER AND YOU MIGHT ALSO KNOW
THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ACADEMIC CENTERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS EARLIEST CONCEPTUALLY TRICKY AND CREATIVE DISCIPLINE OF PROTOTYPE DRUG DISCOVERY SO WHAT NEXT
ACCELERATE THE DELIVERY OF TARGETED THERAPEUTICS TO PATIENTS WITH CANCER NOW THE BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES ALL OF YOU THIS RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC
AND SO WE STARTED TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM WE DEVELOPED LIBRARIES OF COMPOUNDS AND EVENTUALLY ARRIVED AT THIS AND SIMILAR SUBSTANCES CALLED JQ1 NOW NOT BEING A DRUG COMPANY WE COULD DO CERTAIN THINGS WE HAD CERTAIN FLEXIBILITIES
OF DRUG DISCOVERY TWO OF WHICH A TOPICAL DRUG FOR LYMPHOMA OF THE SKIN AND
MILESTONE
I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH JUST TWO IDEAS
THE FIRST IS IF ANYTHING IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS RESEARCH IT'S LESS THE SCIENCE THAN THE STRATEGY
THIS FOR US WAS A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT
AN EXPERIMENT IN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF WE WERE AS OPEN AND HONEST
THIS MALIGNANCY IT'S THREE
SO WE STARTED TO WONDER WHAT WOULD A DRUG COMPANY DO AT THIS POINT WELL THEY PROBABLY WOULD KEEP THIS A SECRET UNTIL THEY TURN THE PROTOTYPE DRUG INTO AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL SUBSTANCE
TUBE IN THAT WAS DRAINING LITTLE BITS OF DEBRIS AND EVERY NURSING SHIFT WE WOULD THROW THIS MATERIAL OUT AND SO WE APPROACHED THIS PATIENT AND ASKED IF HE WOULD COLLABORATE WITH US
{LG} I'VE NEVER SEEN REALLY ANYWHERE THIS UNIQUE SUPPORT FOR CANCER RESEARCH AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU
A DRUG COMPANY WE DON'T HAVE A PIPELINE THAT WE CAN DEPOSIT THESE MOLECULES INTO WE DON'T HAVE A TEAM OF SALESPEOPLE AND MARKETEERS TO TELL US HOW TO POSITION THIS DRUG AGAINST THE OTHER
WHAT WE DO HAVE IS THE FLEXIBILITY OF AN ACADEMIC CENTER TO WORK WITH COMPETENT MOTIVATED ENTHUSIASTIC HOPEFULLY WELL FUNDED PEOPLE TO CARRY THESE MOLECULES FORWARD INTO THE CLINIC WHILE PRESERVING OUR ABILITY TO SHARE THE PROTOTYPE DRUG WORLDWIDE
LIKE THE FOLKS IN MY HOMETOWN OF CHICAGO {LG} FAIL TO DEVELOP FATTY LIVER
IT WITH OUR COMPOUND THIS ADDICTION TO SUGAR THIS RAPID GROWTH FADED
YOU'D SAY DISSATISFIED WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF THESE MEDICINES I
THERE ARE 500 OF THESE GENES THAT ARE BONA FIDE DRIVERS CAUSES OF CANCER YET COMPARATIVELY WE HAVE ABOUT A DOZEN TARGETED MEDICATIONS AND THIS INADEQUACY OF CANCER MEDICINE REALLY HIT HOME WHEN
THE CHEMICAL IDENTITY OF OUR PRO COMPOUND IT'S THE INFORMATION THAT WE MOST NEED FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THE INFORMATION ON HOW
THESE EARLY PROTOTYPE DRUGS MIGHT WORK
YET THIS INFORMATION IS LARGELY A SECRET
AND SO WE SEEK
REALLY TO DOWNLOAD FROM THE AMAZING SUCCESSES OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE INDUSTRY TWO PRINCIPLES THAT OF OPEN SOURCE
BLOWING AND I FEEL REALLY PROUD REALLY HONORED AND HE'S A WONDERFUL MUSICIAN SO IT'S COOL {LG} CA
WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON INSTEAD OF SEEKING TO FIND OUR DIFFERENCES THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS
A BRIDGE ACROSS THIS VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION IT HAS BEEN MY PERSONAL EDGE AND MY GOAL THAT I SET FOR MYSELF WAS TO DEVELOP AN APPROACH THAT
IT'S YOUR FAULT AND IT'S YOUR FAULT AND IT'S YOUR FAULT SO THE IMMATURE EGO NEEDS TO GROW UP AND
SUCH AS THE DALAI LAMA GANDHI MARTIN LUTHER KING MIGHT SHOW UP THERE ARE ALSO SCIENTISTS PHILOSOPHERS AND VARIOUS WRITERS ACROSS TIME THAT MAY SHOW
I HAVE ASKED MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THIS QUESTION OVER THE YEARS AND TYPICALLY WE GET VERY SIMILAR LISTS OF NAMES WHO DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE EXEMPLARY IN THIS DOMAIN OF SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCE YOU MIGHT CALL THEM SPIRITUAL LEADERS AND CERTAIN RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL TEACHERS CONSISTENTLY POP UP THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST HERE INCLUDING JESUS AND BUDDHA
THERE ARE POLITICAL CHANGE AGENTS SOME OF WHOM ARE ALSO RELIGIOUS OR
SO WHAT GETS IN THE WAY WELL PART OF WHAT GETS IN THE WAY IS THIS IDENTITY THING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD SOMETIMES WE REFER TO THIS IDENTITY AS OUR IMMATURE EGO THIS IS THE
THAT I HAVE OVER THE LAST 15 TO 20 YEARS REALLY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AN OPTION FOR US THAT ALLOWS US
WHAT I ALSO THEN ASK PEOPLE IS WHY DO YOU ADMIRE THESE PEOPLE WHAT MAKES THEM EXEMPLARY WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM THAT IS NOT JUST IQ AND NOT JUST EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE BUT SOMETHING MORE THIS IS PARTIAL LIST OF THE
FROM WE'RE ALL IRRITATED AND ANNOYED WITH EACH OTHER YOU MIGHT FIND THAT OTHER PEOPLE MAKE YOU REALLY HOSTILE OR ANGRY SO THE MOVE IS FROM ANTIPATHY TO APATHY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A STEP FORWARD
GIFT OF THIS APPROACH IS THESE GENERIC TERMS OF EGO SELF AND HIGHER SELF BECAUSE THEN WE CAN USE SYNONYMS TO HELP PEOPLE BRIDGE TO CONNECT THEIR FAITH TRADITION OR THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM TO THESE MORE GENERIC LARGER TERMS
AND I CAME UP WITH THIS PARABLE FROM THE EASTERN TRADITION THAT SAYS LOVE
THE SMALL SELF SOMETHING THAT IS VERY TRANSCENDENT ALL INCLUSIVE
SO INITIALLY I THOUGHT WHAT IF WE DEFINE SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCE AS THE ABILITY TO BEHAVE WITH LOVE BECAUSE THIS LOVE WORD KEPT COMING UP
BUT THE WORD LOVE IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS FAIRLY SLOPPY YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THIS WE SAY I LOVE MY CHILDREN AND I LOVE ICE CREAM
SYMPATHY BECAUSE THEY'RE FEELING THE ONE UP ONE DOWN BUT IT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD FROM APATHY SO THIS IS GOOD EMPATHY IS THE NEXT STEP AND THIS IS A PEER TO PEER EMOTION YOUR SADNESS IS MY SADNESS I AM
SINCE THE BEGINNING
AND IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR WITH OUR DEFINITIONS
AND WITH A LIST OF SYNONYMS THAT HELP US TO BUILD THIS BRIDGE
THE FIRST DEFINITION THAT I USUALLY HAVE TO CLARIFY FOR PEOPLE IS WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SPIRITUALITY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RELIGION AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SPIRITUAL
AT LEVEL 1 ON THIS SKILL WHICH IS THE NOVICE IT'S JUST BEING ABLE TO LISTEN TO DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW THIS IS ACTUALLY A DIFFICULT FIRST STEP BEING
FAITH NEUTRAL AND SCIENCE FRIENDLY THIS
THE SOLUTION IS TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT TO THE WISER MORE COMPASSIONATE VOICE INSIDE OF US OUR
OF WALLS BETWEEN PEOPLE AND WE CAN DO THAT BY
AS WE DO THIS WORK OF SHIFTING TO HIGHER SELF WE'RE ACTUALLY DEVELOPING THE 21 SKILLS OF SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE ONE THAT IN PARTICULAR I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING FOR YOU HERE TODAY IS SKILL 7
IS MY CUTTING EDGE I WORK ON THIS MYSELF EVERY DAY AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF
THE SAME SO I WENT IN SEARCH OF BETTER
AS WE STRUGGLE TO MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THIS LIFE AND WE HEAR VERY DIFFERENTLY AND AT LEVEL 5 I CAN
NOW THIS IS NOT TO SAY WE DON'T SET BOUNDARIES WITH PEOPLE OF COURSE WE NEED
OF OURSELF AND THAT INCLUDES CERTAIN PREFERENCES AND AS WE DEVELOP THOSE PREFERENCES WE BUILD IN GROUPS AND OUT GROUPS THE IN GROUP OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE ME AND THE OUT GROUP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LIKE ME
SO THE NEXT MOVE IS TO COMPASSION AND WHAT THE RESEARCH IS SHOWING {NS} IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO MOVE FROM EMPATHY TO COMPASSION YOU
SAD BUT TRUE THAT WE COULD JUST GET TO THE POINT OF AT LEAST BEING NEUTRAL ABOUT EACH OTHER TO BEING MILDLY
AT LEVEL 3 WE LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES EVEN DURING CONFLICT AT LEVEL 4 WE CAN
NATURE OR NON DUAL SELF OR YOUR AUTHENTIC SELF THERE ARE DOZENS OF OTHER SYNONYMS THAT YOU COULD PICK FROM THE IDEA IS YOU FIND THE SYNONYM THAT WORKS FOR YOU BUT COLLECTIVELY WE BRIDGE BY USING THIS GENERIC LANGUAGE
AND WE START FEELING WITH THE WORLD AROUND US THIS IS ALSO TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHEN YOU START FEELING ALL THE SUFFERING ON THIS PLANET YOU CAN FEEL OVERWHELMED AND WANT TO
SO SPIRITUALITY IS THE LARGER WORD RELIGION IS THE NARROWER WORD
MOST OF US ARE QUITE ANNOYING AT LEAST TO EACH OTHER I'M NOT BUT YOU ARE {LG} WHY IS THAT WHY IS IT THAT WE ARE SO ANNOYING TO EACH OTHER WELL IN PART IT HAS TO DO WITH THIS
SELF THE WORLD BECOMES MUCH MORE JOYOUS PLACE WE CAN EMBRACE OUR DIFFERENCES AND FIND GREAT
MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THE INVALUABLE ROLE PLAYED BY CARERS NOW HOW MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM CONSIDER YOURSELF A CARER
AND ABOVE ALL NEVER GIVING UP DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES HE ENCOUNTERED INCLUDING FROM A WORK AND QUALITY OF LIFE
NUMBERS AMONG OTHERS DEMONSTRATE THAT IF CARERS WERE TO STOP CARING TOMORROW
CARERS ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE SACRIFICING THEIR OWN PHYSICAL FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL BEING TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES
THE IMPORTANCE AND DEMANDS ON FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE GREATER THAN EVER
ALSO STUNNING ARE THE BENEFITS THAT CARERS BRING TO OUR SOCIETIES I WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE FROM AUSTRALIA IN 2015 THE
HE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD FOR ME DRIVING LONG DISTANCES FROM ONE TREATMENT CENTER TO ANOTHER SEARCHING FOR THE BEST
CAREGIVING HAS FORMED THE INVISIBLE BACKBONE OF OUR HEALTH AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ALSO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE THEY OFTEN KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONE'S CONDITION AND NEEDS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN THE PATIENTS THEMSELVES WHO MAY BE PARALYZED OR CONFUSED BY THEIR DIAGNOSIS
THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENT THOUGH IN THE RECOGNITION OF CARERS AROUND THE WORLD JUST A FEW YEARS AGO AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF CARER ORGANIZATIONS OR IACO WAS FORMED TO BRING TOGETHER CARER GROUPS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
60 YEAR OLD MAN CARING FOR HIS WIFE WHO HAS TERMINAL CANCER OR AN 80 YEAR OLD WOMAN CARING FOR HER HUSBAND WHO HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY ARE FACING AND ABOVE ALL HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VALUE TO PATIENTS OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND SOCIETY IS RECOGNIZED
THEY MANAGE FINANCES AND THEY ALSO DEAL WITH DAILY HOUSEHOLD TASKS THESE CHALLENGES ARE CHALLENGES THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE
AND YET THEY'RE LARGELY GOING UNRECOGNIZED
MORE I SAW CARERS PROVIDING THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT THAT MY FATHER PROVIDED TO ME AND PLAYING A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE HEALTHCARE
IN ADDITION CARERS ARE FACING ENORMOUS PERSONAL
PUT THE CARE BACK INTO HEALTH CARE I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DREW ME TO THIS SECTOR WAS MY INTEREST IN THE CARE COMPONENT OF OUR HEALTHCARE
MY COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO THIS CAUSE
AND HAS DEVELOPED AN UNPRECEDENTED FRAMEWORK FOR ITS EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY AS WHOLE
THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPOWER CARERS TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND BRING ABOUT A GREATER BALANCE TO THEIR LIVES
YEAR OLD MAN JUGGLING FULL TIME WORK WHILE CARING FOR HIS FAMILY WHO LIVES FAR AWAY
WHAT'S NEEDED IS A DEEP SOCIETAL STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN THROUGH A CHANGE IN MINDSET AND THIS CAN START TODAY
WHEN YOU GO HOME TODAY OR TO THE OFFICE TOMORROW MORNING EMBRACE A CARER THANK THEM OFFER HIM OR HER A BIT OF HELP MAYBE EVEN VOLUNTEER AS A CARER YOURSELF FOR A COUPLE HOURS A WEEK
BACTERIAL MENINGITIS FIBROMYALGIA YOU NAME IT THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT
OF YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT I WAS REFERRING TO A NURSE OR SOME OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL
ALSO OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE IS THE FACT THAT CARERS ALSO PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THEY ORGANIZE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS
CARING FOR SOMEONE SHOULD BE A CHOICE AND SHOULD BE DONE WITHOUT PUTTING ONE'S OWN WELL BEING IN THE BALANCE BUT TO REALLY PUT THE CARE BACK INTO HEALTH CARE
ENTITIES ARE ALSO STARTING TO RECOGNIZE THE SITUATION OF CARERS I AM PROUD THAT MY PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM TOWARDS THIS TOPIC OF CARERS FOUND AN ECHO IN MY OWN WORKPLACE
AND EVEN IF THESE NUMBERS ARE IMPRESSIVE THEY'RE MOST LIKELY UNDERESTIMATED GIVEN THE LACK OF RECOGNITION OF CARERS
I UNDERSTAND NOW MORE THAN EVER THE DEMANDS THAT CAREGIVERS FACE
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU WHO RAISED YOUR HANDS FOR THE TIME THAT YOU'VE SPENT AS A CARER WHAT YOU DO IS EXTREMELY PRECIOUS
IF CARERS AROUND THE WORLD FELT BETTER RECOGNIZED IT WOULD NOT ONLY IMPROVE THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND SENSE OF FULFILLMENT BUT
BREADS THAT I COULDN'T SELL DURING THAT DAY OR FRUITS
THIS IS ALREADY LIKE TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND EVERYDAY WE WOULD GO WITH AN ELECTRICAL VAN TO A COUPLE OF SUPERMARKETS WE WOULD PICK UP SOME FOOD AND AT
EXAMPLE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A DATE ON THEM IF YOU LOOK AT A CAULIFLOWER OF COURSE
IF YOU LOOK AT BREAD IT HAS A PACKAGING DATE BUT IT'S STILL VERY GOOD EVEN IF YOU'RE AT HOME YOU CAN EAT IT THE NEXT DAY
EVERYBODY FEELS INSPIRED TO DO THE SAME AT
THE PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN'T SELL IN THE STORES AND WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A GREAT NIGHT OUT SO WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO START A POP UP PLACE SO THIS IS IN
PRODUCERS MEAT PRODUCERS FISH PRODUCERS AND IN THE NETHERLANDS THEY ALWAYS WORK ON THE BASIS OF FORECASTING SO BY THE TIME THEY SEE THAT
SO WE GET OUR BEER FROM HEINEKEN BUT THEN WE WERE LIKE EVERYBODY WANTS SPECIAL BREWS AND STUFF SO WE GOT CONNECTED TO A FEW PEOPLE IN
FIND BEER WITH HEINEKEN EVEN BEER SUPPLIERS OR PRODUCERS THEY HAVE TO SELL EVERYTHING WITHIN A THREE MONTH
FOOD BANKS BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO SOLVE TOGETHER AND EVERYBODY SHOULD BE WILLING TO EAT FOOD SURPLUS BASICALLY
THAT WE MIGHT ALREADY FORGOTTEN THAT KNOWLEDGE BUT IN THIS BOOK YOU CAN REALLY EASILY
IF THE FOOD IS NOT SOLD AT THE END OF THE DAY HOW
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING HOW IS THIS WORKING BECAUSE FOOD
FOR 22 50 THREE COURSES OR FOR 27 50 YOU EAT
TIME WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE USE OUR RESOURCES ME AND SOME
BEGINNING IF YOU CONSIDER HOW MUCH FOOD WE THROW AWAY IN THE WORLD SO WE HOPE
ONLY THE RETAIL OR THE PRODUCERS OR THE FARMERS WHO ARE THROWING AWAY A LOT OF FOOD
OVER 200000 KILOS OF FOOD BUT THAT IS
THROWING AWAY IS STILL ACTUALLY THROWN AWAY BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE
PRODUCTION OF FOOD WE USE A LOT OF WATER WE USE A LOT OF ENERGY A LOT OF TRANSPORT IS USED TO GO FROM A TO B WITH ALL THE FOOD AND ALSO
TO PAINT SOLAR SYSTEMS ON THE BACKS OF HER HANDS SO SHE HAS TO LEARN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE BEFORE SHE CAN SAY OH I KNOW THAT LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND AND SHE'S GOING TO LEARN
YOUR HANDS TO CATCH AND WIND UP WITH ONLY BLISTERS AND BRUISES WHEN YOU STEP OUT OF THE PHONE BOOTH AND
YOU DIVE INTO THE THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW I USE POETRY TO HELP ME WORK THROUGH WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT I SHOW
TURNED TO ASH AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE CITY SOON FOLLOWED THE LONG LASTING DAMAGE OF NUCLEAR
I'LL TELL HER REMEMBER YOUR MOMMA IS A WORRIER AND YOUR POPPA IS A WARRIOR AND YOU ARE THE GIRL WITH SMALL HANDS AND BIG EYES WHO NEVER STOPS ASKING FOR MORE REMEMBER THAT GOOD THINGS COME IN THREES AND
SO DO BAD THINGS
ALWAYS APOLOGIZE WHEN YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG BUT
LAUGHED BECAUSE THE FIRST SARAH SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IMPOSSIBLE AND ME WELL NEITHER DO I
THE IMPOSSIBLE EVERY DAY IMPOSSIBLE IS TRYING TO CONNECT IN THIS WORLD TRYING TO HOLD ONTO OTHERS WHILE THINGS ARE BLOWING UP AROUND YOU KNOWING THAT WHILE YOU'RE SPEAKING THEY AREN'T JUST WAITING FOR THEIR TURN TO
OR OWNS A CAMERA BUT EVERYONE CAN COMMUNICATE IN SOME WAY AND EVERYONE HAS STORIES THAT THE REST OF US CAN LEARN FROM PLUS SPOKEN WORD POETRY ALLOWS
SHADOW OF POSITIVE LIGHT
AFTER THE A BOMB SPECIALISTS SAID IT WOULD TAKE 75 YEARS FOR THE RADIATION DAMAGED SOIL OF HIROSHIMA CITY TO EVER GROW ANYTHING AGAIN BUT THAT SPRING THERE WERE NEW BUDS POPPING UP FROM THE EARTH WHEN I MEET YOU IN THAT MOMENT I'M NO LONGER PART OF YOUR FUTURE I START QUICKLY BECOMING PART OF YOUR PAST BUT IN THAT INSTANT I GET TO SHARE YOUR PRESENT AND YOU
HEAR YOU THEY FEEL EXACTLY WHAT YOU FEEL AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU FEEL IT IT'S WHAT I STRIVE FOR EVERY TIME I OPEN MY MOUTH THAT
POWDER WHEN I WAS BORN MY MOM SAYS I LOOKED
THEY'VE LEARNED WHAT THEY'VE FIGURED OUT TO BE TRUE AND WHAT THEY'RE STILL FIGURING OUT SO
AT THE WORLD THROUGH THE UNDERSIDE OF A GLASS BOTTOM BOAT TO LOOK THROUGH A MICROSCOPE AT THE GALAXIES THAT EXIST ON THE PINPOINT OF A HUMAN MIND BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY MY MOM TAUGHT ME THAT THERE'LL BE DAYS LIKE THIS {NS}
THINGS THAT YOU KNOW TO BE TRUE THEY CAN BE ABOUT WHATEVER YOU WANT TECHNOLOGY ENTERTAINMENT DESIGN YOUR FAMILY WHAT YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST THE ONLY RULE IS DON'T THINK TOO HARD OKAY READY
A NEW POEM OUT OF IT
SPOKEN WORD POETRY IS THE ART OF PERFORMANCE POETRY I TELL PEOPLE IT INVOLVES CREATING POETRY THAT DOESN'T JUST WANT TO SIT ON PAPER THAT SOMETHING ABOUT IT DEMANDS IT BE HEARD OUT LOUD OR WITNESSED IN PERSON
WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS A
LIVE WIRE OF NERVOUS
EDUCATE AND INSPIRE WE STAYED FULL TIME STUDENTS BUT IN BETWEEN WE TRAVELED
POEM LOOK BACK AND GO OH THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT AND SOMETIMES I GET TO THE END OF THE POEM AND HAVEN'T SOLVED ANYTHING BUT
OKAY
SO HERE ARE THREE THINGS I KNOW TO BE TRUE
I KNOW THAT JEAN LUC GODARD WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT A GOOD STORY HAS A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AND AN END
ALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER
I KNOW THAT I'M INCREDIBLY NERVOUS AND EXCITED TO BE UP HERE WHICH IS GREATLY INHIBITING MY ABILITY TO KEEP IT COOL
AND
I KNOW THAT
I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL WEEK TO TELL THIS JOKE
ME AND SAID HEY
I REALLY FELT THAT THANKS
AND LIGHTNING STRUCK
I WAS HOOKED
I DISCOVERED THIS BAR ON MANHATTAN'S LOWER EAST SIDE THAT HOSTED A WEEKLY POETRY OPEN MIC AND MY BEWILDERED BUT SUPPORTIVE PARENTS TOOK ME TO SOAK IN EVERY OUNCE OF SPOKEN WORD THAT I COULD I WAS THE
YOU HAVE ALL THE MORE REASON TO SAY THANK YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE WAY THE OCEAN REFUSES TO STOP KISSING THE SHORELINE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES IT'S SENT AWAY YOU WILL
HAS THE EXACT SAME THING OR ONE THING VERY SIMILAR TO SOMETHING ON YOUR LIST
POETRY IS THE IDEAL ART FORM I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO TELL EACH STORY I WRITE MUSICALS I MAKE SHORT FILMS ALONGSIDE MY POEMS BUT I TEACH SPOKEN WORD POETRY BECAUSE IT'S ACCESSIBLE NOT EVERYONE
WHEN YOUR BOOTS WILL FILL WITH RAIN AND YOU'LL BE UP TO YOUR KNEES IN DISAPPOINTMENT AND THOSE
SOMEONE WHO'S APPARENTLY DONE THIS ALREADY I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED ANYTHING
AND THE COURAGE TO PRESENT THOSE STORIES AND OPINIONS YOU COULD BE REWARDED WITH A ROOM FULL OF
CONNECTION IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ALONE OR THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU BUT SPOKEN WORD TEACHES THAT IF YOU HAVE THE
IN MY MOUTH
BUT IN HIROSHIMA SOME PEOPLE WERE WIPED CLEAN AWAY LEAVING ONLY A WRISTWATCH OR A DIARY PAGE SO NO MATTER THAT I HAVE INHIBITIONS TO FILL ALL MY POCKETS I KEEP TRYING HOPING THAT ONE DAY I'LL WRITE POEM I CAN BE PROUD TO LET SIT IN A MUSEUM EXHIBIT AS THE ONLY PROOF I
MY FIRST TIME HERE THIS ISN'T MY LAST TIME HERE THESE AREN'T THE LAST WORDS I'LL
I HAD CREATED PROJECT V O I C E AS A WAY TO ENCOURAGE MY FRIENDS TO DO SPOKEN WORD WITH ME BUT PHIL AND I DECIDED TO REINVENT PROJECT V I C THIS TIME CHANGING THE MISSION TO USING SPOKEN WORD POETRY AS
THAT IS THE GREATEST PRESENT OF ALL SO IF YOU TELL ME I CAN DO THE IMPOSSIBLE
I'LL PROBABLY LAUGH AT YOU I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN CHANGE THE WORLD YET BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT REINCARNATION EITHER BUT IF YOU MAKE ME LAUGH HARD ENOUGH SOMETIMES I FORGET WHAT CENTURY I'M IN
TO WALK THROUGH LIFE LIKE THIS AND YES THAT MEANS CATCHING ALL OF THOSE MISERIES AND HURT BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT WHEN BEAUTIFUL AMAZING THINGS JUST FALL OUT OF THE SKY I'M READY TO CATCH THEM
SHOULD HAVE A DAUGHTER INSTEAD OF MOM SHE'S GOING TO CALL ME
WORK SHE'S DOING SHE CAN CREATE POEMS THAT ONLY CHARLOTTE CAN WRITE ABOUT EYEBALLS AND ELEVATORS AND DORA THE EXPLORER AND I'M TRYING TO TELL STORIES ONLY I CAN TELL
LIKE THIS STORY I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO TELL THIS STORY AND I WONDERED IF THE BEST WAY WAS GOING TO BE A POWERPOINT A SHORT FILM AND WHERE EXACTLY WAS THE BEGINNING THE MIDDLE OR THE END
I WONDERED WHETHER I'D GET TO THE END OF THIS TALK AND FINALLY HAVE FIGURED IT ALL OUT
OR NOT
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MY BEGINNING WAS AT THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS MUCH EARLIER
IN PREPARING FOR TED I DISCOVERED THIS
IT TURNS OUT SOMETIMES POETRY CAN BE REALLY SCARY
KNOW THAT THE NUMBER ONE RULE TO BEING COOL IS TO SEEM UNFAZED TO NEVER ADMIT THAT ANYTHING SCARES YOU OR IMPRESSES YOU
THE SCARECROW INVITED TO TED BECAUSE HE WAS OUT STANDING IN HIS FIELD
OR YOUR COMMUNITY WHO WILL LISTEN AND MAYBE EVEN A GIANT GIRL IN A HOODIE WHO WILL CONNECT WITH WHAT YOU'VE SHARED AND THAT IS AN
WRITING THE SAME POEM OR KEEP TELLING THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER ONCE YOU'VE FIGURED OUT THAT IT WILL GAIN YOU APPLAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST TEACH THAT YOU CAN EXPRESS YOURSELF YOU HAVE TO
STUDENTS A FRESHMAN NAMED CHARLOTTE WAS NOT CONVINCED
CHARLOTTE WAS VERY GOOD AT WRITING LISTS BUT SHE REFUSED TO WRITE ANY POEMS
MISS SHE'D SAY
I'M JUST NOT INTERESTING I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING INTERESTING TO SAY
SO I ASSIGNED HER LIST AFTER LIST AND ONE DAY I ASSIGNED THE LIST 10 THINGS I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED BY NOW
NUMBER THREE ON CHARLOTTE'S LIST WAS
LEARNED NOT TO CRUSH ON GUYS THREE TIMES MY AGE
I ASKED HER WHAT THAT MEANT AND SHE SAID MISS IT'S KIND OF A LONG STORY AND I SAID CHARLOTTE IT SOUNDS PRETTY INTERESTING TO ME AND SO SHE WROTE HER FIRST POEM A LOVE POEM UNLIKE ANY I HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE AND THE POEM BEGAN
ANDERSON COOPER IS A GORGEOUS MAN
FIND THE BOY WHO LIT THE FIRE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SEE IF YOU CAN CHANGE HIM BUT I KNOW SHE WILL ANYWAY SO INSTEAD I'LL ALWAYS KEEP AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF CHOCOLATE AND RAIN BOOTS NEARBY BECAUSE THERE IS NO HEARTBREAK THAT CHOCOLATE CAN'T FIX
AND THE POETS WHO PERFORMED ENCOURAGED ME TO SHARE MY STORIES AS WELL NEVER MIND THE FACT THAT I WAS 14 THEY TOLD ME WRITE ABOUT BEING 14
SO I DID AND STOOD AMAZED EVERY WEEK WHEN THESE BRILLIANT GROWN UP POETS LAUGHED WITH ME AND GROANED THEIR SYMPATHY AND CLAPPED AND TOLD ME HEY I REALLY FELT THAT TOO
NOW I CAN DIVIDE MY
SPOKEN WORD JOURNEY INTO THREE STEPS
MY FEAR OF EVER BEING LOOKED AT FOR TOO LONG I WAS FASCINATED BY THE IDEA OF SPOKEN WORD POETRY I FELT THAT MY TWO SECRET LOVES POETRY AND THEATER HAD COME TOGETHER
HAD A BABY
A BABY NEEDED TO GET TO KNOW SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY
MY FIRST SPOKEN WORD POEM PACKED WITH ALL THE WISDOM OF A 14 YEAR OLD WAS ABOUT THE
SPOKEN WORD TO HELP MY STUDENTS REDISCOVER WONDER TO FIGHT THEIR INSTINCTS TO BE COOL AND UNFAZED AND INSTEAD ACTIVELY PURSUE BEING ENGAGED WITH WHAT GOES ON AROUND THEM SO THAT THEY CAN REINTERPRET AND CREATE SOMETHING FROM IT IT'S NOT THAT I THINK THAT
I HAVE OLD EYES WHEN MY GRANDPA GENJI DIED I WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD BUT I TOOK MY MOM BY THE HAND AND TOLD
ELSE HAS SOMETHING THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF YOURS THIRD SOMEONE HAS SOMETHING YOU'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE FOURTH SOMEONE HAS SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT BUT THEY'RE INTRODUCING A NEW ANGLE OF LOOKING AT IT AND I TELL
AND EXPLORE AND TAKE RISKS AND CHALLENGE YOURSELF AND THAT IS STEP THREE INFUSING THE WORK YOU'RE DOING WITH THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT MAKE YOU YOU EVEN WHILE THOSE THINGS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING BECAUSE STEP THREE
AND TEACHING NINE YEAR OLDS TO MFA CANDIDATES
BY
AT LEAST A DECADE BUT SOMEHOW THE POETS AT THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB DIDN'T SEEM BOTHERED BY THE 14 YEAR OLD WANDERING ABOUT IN FACT THEY WELCOMED ME
AND IT WAS HERE LISTENING TO THESE POETS SHARE THEIR STORIES THAT I LEARNED THAT SPOKEN WORD POETRY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE INDIGNANT IT COULD BE FUN OR
PAINFUL OR SERIOUS OR SILLY THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB BECAME MY CLASSROOM
IN WIN SOME
LOSE SOME YOU WILL PUT THE STAR IN STARTING OVER AND OVER AND NO MATTER HOW MANY LAND MINES ERUPT IN A MINUTE BE SURE YOUR MIND LANDS ON THE BEAUTY OF THIS FUNNY PLACE CALLED LIFE AND YES ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO OVER TRUSTING I AM
PRETTY DAMN NAIVE
WILL HIT YOU HARD IN THE FACE WAIT FOR YOU TO GET BACK UP JUST SO IT CAN KICK YOU IN THE STOMACH BUT GETTING THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU IS THE ONLY WAY TO REMIND YOUR LUNGS HOW MUCH THEY LIKE THE TASTE OF AIR
YOU SEE HIM ON 60 MINUTES RACING MICHAEL PHELPS IN A POOL NOTHING BUT SWIM TRUNKS
IT QUITE REACHES ITS MAXIMUM
SO WHY DOES THE DRESS STOP SPREADING HAS EVERYBODY IN THE POPULATION SEEN THE DRESS
WELL NO BY THE TIME THAT THE DRESS STOPS SPREADING
NOT EVERYBODY HAS SEEN IT
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER SHARING THE DRESS NEVER QUITE REACHES BACK UP TO A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION
IT STOPS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SHARING THE DRESS CAN'T FIND ANY NEW PEOPLE TO SHARE IT WITH
SO THEY LOSE INTEREST BEFORE THEY GET TO PASS IT ON TO ANYBODY ELSE AND SO THE SHARING NUMBERS DROP TO ZERO
SO INCREASING COMPUTATIONAL POWER THOUGH HAS MEANT THAT THE PROCESS OF MATHEMATICALLY MODELING INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAS GOT MUCH MUCH FASTER AND WE CAN NOW ADD A LOT MORE DATA INTO MODELS TO TRY AND BUILD MATCH WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN A POPULATION
SO IN THIS ERA OF BIG DATA
WITH RAPID ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WE ARE SEEING A RAPID EVOLUTION IN THE FIELD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELLING
SO HERE IS JUST A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING
CAREFUL PLANNING AIDED BY THE USE OF MATHEMATICAL
MODELS WE WIPE DISEASES THAT HAVE CAUSED MILLIONS OF DEATHS OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH
BUT INFECTIOUS DISEASES ISN'T THE ONLY APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS TO HEALTH PROBLEMS THERE ARE MANY BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT ARE STILL A MYSTERY
AND LEND THEMSELVES TO MATHEMATICAL EXPLORATION
THIS QUESTION WAS FIRST POSED BY A FACEBOOK USER
WHO WAS A FAMILY MEMBER OF THE PERSON WHO OWNED THE DRESS THERE HAD BEEN A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE COLOR OF THE DRESS AND LATER ANOTHER USER POSTED THE PHOTO ON TUMBLR AND THE REST IS HISTORY
WITH OVER TEN MILLION TWEETS IN THE FIRST WEEK THIS IS AN EXTREME CASE OF GOING VIRAL
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEDRESS SPREADS THROUGH A POPULATION
WHAT WE ARE DOING AS WELL IS ASSUMING THAT EVERYBODY IN THESE GROUPS HAS IDENTICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIORS
AND NOT MANY DISEASES OR POPULATIONS BEHAVE QUITE SO SIMPLY SO WE OFTEN HAVE TO ALLOW FOR NEW MEMBERS TO JOIN THE POPULATION
OR FOR OLD MEMBERS TO LEAVE
OR WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT FOR SOME DISEASES JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD THEM IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM AGAIN
AND WE NEED TO ADD IN VACCINATION AND TREATMENT FOR SOME DISEASES AS WELL IF WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY SPREAD THROUGH A POPULATION
SO WE CAN RUN VIRTUAL EXPERIMENTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE HOW MANY CASES COULD WE PREVENT IF WE HAD AN EFFECTIVE VACCINE AGAINST EBOLA FOR EXAMPLE
LIKE EBOLA OR INFLUENZA WHOOPING COUGH
OR MEASLES
AND FORTUNATELY NONE OF THESE DISEASES OR INDEED ANY OTHERS KNOWN TO MAN SPREAD ANY WAY NEAR AS QUICKLY AS THEDRESS DOES THROUGH A POPULATION
SO WHILE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP A MEME SUCH AS THEDRESS FROM SPREADING ONCE IT STARTS GOING WE'VE GOT AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS WITH WHICH TO FIGHT INFECTIOUS DISEASES
VACCINES ANTIBIOTICS QUARANTINE JUST TO NAME A FEW
AND A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON BEHIND THE SCENES
MATHEMATICS
USING MATHEMATICS TO STUDY INFECTIOUS DISEASES ISN'T NEW
A SCIENTIST CALLED DANIEL BERNOULLI FIRST USED PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS NEARLY 250 YEARS AGO
TO CALCULATE THE BENEFITS OF VACCINATION AGAINST SMALLPOX
AND THE MODEL THAT I USED TO DESCRIBE THE SPREAD OF THEDRESS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN USED BY EPIDEMIOLOGISTS FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED YEARS
IT'S USED TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES AND SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND TO HELP DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO PREVENT AND CONTROL THEM
AS HE AND I WERE BOTH TRYING FOR 100 ON THE STATE MATH EXAMS SO I WAS PUZZLED WHY ISN'T HE PAYING
I REMEMBER OVER EATING PIECES OF OUR 17TH BIRTHDAY CAKE TOGETHER
I HYPOTHESISED THAT BOTH MALES AND FEMALES WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA MAY BE LESS RESPONSIVE TO OESTROGEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOWER THAN NORMAL
THERE WEREN'T MEDICATIONS THAT COULD TREAT SCHIZOPHRENIA SATISFACTORILY
NOR DID I KNOW THAT MY TWIN BROTHER
WOULD HAVE TO SPEND TIME IN A STATE MENTAL INSTITUTION WHERE HE WOULD FEEL POISONED BY THE FIRST ANTIPSYCHOTICS HE RECEIVED
IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO YEARS TO REALISE JUST HOW SICK SCOTT WAS AND THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO GET BETTER ANY TIME SOON AND THAT SOMETHING MAJOR HAD TO BE DONE TO BRING SCOTT BACK TO HIS FORMER SELF I WAS CONVINCED THAT HAVING SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS NOT SCOTT'S FAULT WAS NOT MY MUM'S
WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME STUDIES GAIN MORE MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN DAILY
KNOW THAT ONE PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE WORLD'S POPULATION SUFFERS FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA I
SURPRISINGLY THAT THE MALE BRAIN AND THE FEMALE BRAIN HAVE EQUAL LEVELS OF OESTROGEN RECEPTOR SO MALES LISTENING TODAY WHILE YOU MAY NOT FEEL VERY IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER FEMALE' YOUR BRAIN NEURONS SURE
AND I CHOSE SERM A SELECTIVE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATOR
THIS DRUG IS ALREADY IN USE FOR OSTEOPOROSIS THUS WE REPURPOSED THE AVAILABLE DRUG THAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN TO BE SAFE AND WE USED IT IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
TOM AND I WROTE OUR FIRST FEDERAL GRANT AND OUR CLINICAL TRIAL WAS BORN
MEANWHILE BACK IN MY CHILDHOOD HOME
MY BROTHER WAS SLIPPING FROM ME
IT FEELS SO AMAZING TO BE HERE AT THIS PLACE IN THIS TIME AM I REALLY IN THE
I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THE POSITIVE PRELIMINARY DATA WHERE WITH SIX WEEKS OF SERM THERAPY WE FOUND AN IMPROVEMENT
BUT SCOTT DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HIS ROOM CLAIMING TO BE RECEIVING SPECIAL VOICE MESSAGES AND THIS WAS WELL BEFORE IPHONES IN FACT THERE WAS NO PHONE IN HIS ROOM AT
HIS ILLNESS HAD A BIOLOGICAL BASIS JUST LIKE DIABETES
MALES TEND TO GET SCHIZOPHRENIA EARLIER ON IN LIFE
BE MORE TREATMENT RESISTANT AND HAVE MORE SEVERE SYMPTOMS WOMEN WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA HAVE WORSE SYMPTOMS AT TIMES WHEN OESTROGEN LEVELS ARE LOW
THIS LED ME AND OTHERS TO CONSIDER
AND POSTULATE THAT SOMEHOW OESTROGEN WAS PROTECTIVE AGAINST SCHIZOPHRENIA
AT
IN THE TOWEL ON THE OESTROGEN HYPOTHESIS BUT I WASN'T READY TO GIVE UP SO I WAS FORCED TO RETHINK MY STRATEGY
DURING MY LONG EFFORT TO PROVE THAT OESTROGEN RECEPTOR WAS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX I DISCOVERED THERE WASN'T JUST ONE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR BUT THERE WERE A DOZEN DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF OESTROGEN RECEPTORS IN THE CEREBRAL
APPEARED TO BE SPARED FROM THIS TERRIBLE EVENT THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE HE WAS A MALE AND I WAS A FEMALE SO THIS LED TO MY CURIOSITY AROUND SEX DIFFERENCES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
THAT WAS 30 YEARS AGO
WHAT CLUES DID I HAVE THAT GUIDED ME IN MY QUEST I HAD THREE FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH MY TWIN'S ILLNESS HARDLY OBJECTIVE BUT REAL TO ME
SO THESE THREE CLUES WHAT WERE THEY NUMBER ONE SCOTT AND I SHARED THE SAME WOMB SO IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT SCOTT'S SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS DUE TO AN EARLY EMBRYONIC EVENT
TO DETECT THE HORMONAL SIGNAL CAPTURE IT AND TRANSMIT A MEANINGFUL
HIM AND THREW HIM IN JAIL
AT THE STATION
IN FRONT OF MY MUM HE TOLD THE POLICE SHE IS NOT MY MOTHER MY MOTHER IS YOKO ONO
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME I DIDN'T RECOGNISE MY TWIN
THE TYPE OF OESTROGEN RECEPTOR DIFFERENT AND BINGO I FOUND THAT IN THE BRAINS OF PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO EXPRESS A MUTATED OR ALTERED FORM OF THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR
TOM AND I AGREED THAT WE WANT TO STIMULATE THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR WE ALSO AGREED THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO IMPROVE COGNITION
IN MALES AND FEMALES WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST TREATMENT RESISTANT ASPECTS OF THE DISEASE
TOM AND I ALSO AGREED THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A BRAND NEW COMPOUND
BECAUSE WE WERE LOUSY ORGANIC CHEMISTS WE DIDN'T HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS HANGING AROUND AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT A COUPLE OF MORE
YOU ARE NOT MY SISTER YOU ARE THE DAUGHTER OF THE DEVIL WE TRIED TO TALK SCOTT OUT OF THESE BIZARRE BELIEFS AND OTHERS LIKE IT BUT MOSTLY WE DISMISSED HIS IRRATIONAL SPEECH AND HOPED IT WOULD GO AWAY
AND FEMALES WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA THAT WE CAN SUCCEED WHERE MANY LARGE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE NOT THIS GIVES TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM TO OUR
HOW WONDERFUL IT WAS GOING TO BE WHEN WE LICKED THIS DAMN DISEASE AND HE VOICED HE WOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO TRAVEL AND SEE THE WORLD WITH ME AND I IMAGINED HIM BEING ABLE TO PURSUE HIS INTEREST IN MATH AND ENGINEERING
IT WAS HARDER TO MAKE OUR REGULAR CALLS WORK AND HE HAD TO E MAIL ME WITH HIS WORRIES AND REQUESTS WHICH JUST IT ISN'T THE SAME
SCOTT'S HEALTH GOT WORSE
AND HE DEVELOPED DIABETES AND PUT ON WEIGHT
I WAS THE ONE HE RELIED ON AND I WAS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO REACH
SO I DID MAKE IT HOME IN BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS FOR A FEW WEEKS
TO VISIT MY
AND IN HEALTHY CONTROLS AT THIS POINT MOST SCIENTISTS WOULD HAVE
WITH CHALLENGES I HAD TO MOVE FROM WASHINGTON DC ALL THE WAY TO HERE SYDNEY AUSTRALIA IT ALSO CAME WITH TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AND THAT WAS TO WORK WITH MY HUSBAND DR THOMAS WEICKERT
SWIMMING AND PLAY HIDE AND GO SEEK' WITH WE ENJOYED SCHOOL BUT WE ENJOYED VACATIONS MORE AS TWINS WE WERE
CAN'T HELP MY BROTHER
BUT I CHOSE TO FIGHT THIS DAMN DISEASE TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT
AND TODAY TODAY I'M MORE
HOPEFULL THAN EVER
THAT WE CAN BEAT MY BROTHER'S ILLNESS THE CLINICAL TRIAL TOOK THREE AND A HALF YEARS TO COMPLETE WITH OVER 80 PEOPLE ENROLLED IN SYDNEY AND ADELAIDE
WERE ORIGINALLY DISMISSED
HOWEVER WE NOW KNOW THAT THIS TYPE OF VARIATION IS COMMON AND IS IN FACT THE RULE FOR HUMAN GENES
IN THE CASE OF OESTROGEN RECEPTORS THIS WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ALLOWED FOR A LOT OF DIVERSITY IN HOW EACH PERSON'S BRAIN COULD RESPOND UNIQUELY TO THE SAME HORMONAL SIGNAL
REALLY FRUSTRATED AND IMPATIENT THAT THE RESEARCH WAS TAKING SO LONG AND I REALLY WANTED TO HELP SCOTT AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM WERE DENIED THEIR OPPORTUNITY IN LIFE DUE TO HAVING SCHIZOPHRENIA
TWO SCOTT WAS A NORMAL KID VERY BRIGHT IN FACT A BOY GENIUS SO HIS BRAIN WAS DEVELOPING JUST FINE DURING CHILDHOOD NUMBER THREE SOMETHING MAJOR HAD TO HAVE HAPPENED TO SCOTT DURING ADOLESCENCE WHEREAS
THIS BREAK MY FAMILY CELEBRATED THANKSGIVING WHERE WE EAT ROAST TURKEY STUFFING AND PUMPKIN PIE IT'S OUR FAMILY'S TRADITION TO GO AROUND THE TABLE BEFORE WE EAT AND SAY WHAT WE ARE THANKFUL FOR
THANKFUL FOR YOU SCOTT
BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN MEANING TO MY LIFE
INDEED HE GAVE ME SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR TO FIND THE CURE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA
SCOTT WON'T HAVE THE CHANCE
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD WITH
HAVE THE CRITICAL INFORMATION ON HOW THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR IS BROKEN YOU CAN NOW DETERMINE WAYS TO FIX IT MEANWHILE MY BROTHER WAS GOING
OFF VARIOUS ANTIPSYCHOTICS AND AT CERTAIN POINTS HE DID FEEL BETTER ONE DAY HE SAID CINDY CAN I COME HELP YOU IN THE LAB AND I KNEW HE HAD THE MOTIVATION AND THE SMARTS BUT I ALSO KNEW HE LACKED THE EDUCATION SO I SUGGESTED
INTO MADNESS
MUM ALLOWED US
ALLOWED SCOTT TO QUIT HIGH SCHOOL
I WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT SHE MOVED US TO A NEIGHBOURHOOD TOWN ENROLLED SCOTT IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE
AND BOUGHT HIM A CAR
TO PROVIDE CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE OESTROGEN RECEPTORS WERE IN THE BRAIN AREAS RESPONSIBLE FOR RATIONAL THOUGHT NOW DURING THESE EXPERIMENTS I
NUMBER ONE TESTOSTERONE THAT WE TEND TO THINK OF AS THE MALE HORMONE GETS CONVERTED QUICKLY AND DIRECTLY INTO OESTROGREN ONCE IT HITS THE BRAIN NUMBER TWO
SEX HORMONE ACTION IS NOT ONLY CONTROLLED BY THE LEVELS OF HORMONES CIRCULATING IN YOUR BLOOD BUT ON THE LOCATION THE AMOUNT AND THE TYPE
OF THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR THAT'S IN YOUR
THIS MOVE ALLOWED US TO COLLABORATE AND WORK TOGETHER AND TO FINALLY TRANSLATE THOSE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR DISCOVERIES I MADE AT THE BENCH INTO A NOVEL TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA
WITH YOU THAT FINALLY WE HAVE A RAY OF HOPE THAT THE MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY THAT WE'VE BEEN DIGGING UP FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS CAN BE TURNED INTO RATIONAL DRUG
A POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AND THIS IS MY EUREKA MOMENT I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW THE OESTROGEN RECEPTOR WAS BROKEN WHAT A MOLECULAR
OR TO GET THAT HIGHER DEGREE OR EVEN TRY THE SERM BECAUSE HE DIED ON THANKSGIVING NIGHT IT
TO THINK CLEARLY I HYPOTHESISED THAT THESE OESTROGEN RECEPTORS MAY BE FOUND IN AREAS OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR REASONING AND LANGUAGE HOWEVER I RAN INTO HUGE ROAD BLOCKS IN THE FIELD WHERE
IT WAS ONLY AFTER HIS ARREST THAT SCOTT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS A LABEL I HAD NOT ENCOUNTERED SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS A LABEL THAT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE
HIM TO QUIT HIGH SCHOOL AND HE SHIED AWAY FROM EVEN CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD FRIENDS
AND STUDIES GENERAL CHEMISTRY FIRST I WAS REALLY PROUD OF HIM FOR FINISHING HIS FIRST SEMESTER OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY WITH ABOVE AVERAGE GRADES BUT THEN SOCIAL ANXIETY TOOK OVER HE COULDN'T FOCUS ON THE MATERIAL OR SIT FOR
HAVE TO TRY TO BE ALIVE IT'S THEIR KIND OF UR STORY ONSTAGE THAT DESPERATION TO
AT ART SCHOOL AND FELL IN LOVE IN 1971
BJ SO THIS PRODUCTION WAS
BASIL AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE TO FORM A PUPPET COMPANY AND 20 YEARS LATER MIRACULOUSLY WE COLLABORATED WITH A COMPANY FROM MALI THE
FROM SUNNY CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ZEM JOAQUIN WHO'S GOING TO RIDE THE HORSE FOR US
MADE OUT OF PLYWOOD COVERED WITH FABRIC CURIOUSLY SIMILAR IN
TOM MORRIS OF THE NATIONAL THEATRE IN LONDON AND JUST AROUND THAT TIME HIS MOTHER HAD SAID HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOOK BY MICHAEL MORPURGO CALLED WAR HORSE
IN LONDON WITH THIS BIG BOX AND A STUDIO FULL OF PEOPLE ABOUT TO WORK WITH US BJ ABOUT 40 PEOPLE AK WE WERE TERRIFIED WE OPENED THE LID WE TOOK THE HORSE
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T MANIPULATE THE NECK FROM INSIDE AND WALK THE HORSE AT THE SAME TIME AK
WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH A HORSE THE HORSE IS SOLD TO THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND HE JOINS UP TO FIND HIS HORSE BJ SO
HORSE WHICH WAS MADE OUT OF STICKS AND BITS OF TWIGS GREW UP INTO THE BIG HORSE AND
THOUGHT THEY WERE SO BENEATH ME I WANTED TO BECOME AN AVANT GARDE ARTIST AND PUNCH
FOR US IT'S THE KIND OF ORIGINAL MOVEMENT FOR ANY PUPPET FOR US ONSTAGE IT'S THE THING THAT DISTINGUISHES THE PUPPET AK OOPS BJ FROM
CENTURY PLOWING TECHNOLOGY AND CAVALRY CHARGES WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT AT THE NATIONAL THEATRE IN LONDON BUT THEY AGREED TO GO ALONG WITH IT FOR A WHILE
BJ SO EVERY MOMENT IT'S ON THE STAGE IT'S MAKING THE STRUGGLE SO WE CALL THIS A PIECE OF EMOTIONAL ENGINEERING THAT USES
MOVES IN SPACE BUT OF COURSE IT WAS THE CANE IS LIGHT THE CANE IS FLEXIBLE THE CANE IS DURABLE AND THE CANE
IT WAS ABLE TO BE RIDDEN HERE I HAVE AN 18 SECOND CLIP OF THE VERY FIRST WALK OF THE
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE LIGHT AND FLEXIBLE AND EACH ONE OF THEM IS DIFFERENT THEY CAN'T BE MASS PRODUCED
IT AN ACTOR STRUGGLES TO DIE ONSTAGE BUT A PUPPET HAS TO STRUGGLE TO LIVE AND IN WAY THAT'S A METAPHOR FOR
TWO PAIRS OF SOCKS AND A BIG SCARF I JUST HAVE A HAND
WE ALL EXPERIENCE IN LIFE EVENTS THAT CHANGE OUR LIVES
SHOWN IN THE MEDIA SEEM TO BE REALLY DISCONNECTED FROM THE HUMAN REALITIES ON THE
WAS STUDYING CONFLICTS I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE MOST COMPLEX CONFLICT OF THE 21ST CENTURY
THE IDEA THAT THIS CONFLICT HAD BECOME A PART OF ME SHAPING WHO I AM
IN 2011 WHEN EVERYTHING STARTED IN SYRIA I WAS A STUDENT IN POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS HERE IN BRUSSELS
IF NOW I ASK MYSELF THIS QUESTION AGAIN WHAT DRIVES ME TO DO ALL OF THIS
I JUST THINK OF THEM OUT THERE
AND THE SMILES ON THEIR FACES
WHEN I TELL THEM THAT YES
THEIR LIVES AND THEIR STORIES MATTER TO OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
THANK
I SOON REALIZED THAT WORDS WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO EXPRESS HOW I FEEL I
IT'S THAT THIS CONFLICT HAS MADE ME REALIZE THE POWER OF THE HUMAN MIND WE LEARN A LOT FROM WAR BY SPENDING TIME THERE SOMETIMES IN VERY
MADE ME QUESTION MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE I DECIDED TO WORK ON ISSUES THAT HAVE A
BE HERE BY THEN BECAUSE HERE DEATH CAN STRIKE AT ANY MOMENT
IN THIS EMPTY AND DARK HOTEL ROOM WITH JUST ONE QUESTION POPPING ON MY IPHONE
I WAS SEEING ON TV MY COUNTRY EXPLODING 4000 KILOMETRES AWAY
IN MY COUNTRY HAUNTED ME AND OBSESSED ME MORE AND MORE
WHO ARE TRYING TO CONTINUE TO SMILE AT LIFE
AS THE TIME PASSED I REALIZED THAT WHAT WAS
TO DEATH GUNS AND BOMBS AND IT'S HARD TO
A CONSTANT MELANCHOLY WAS HIDING AND A FEELING OF BEING POWERLESS BECAME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE
EVENTS CHANGING OUR LIVES FROM GIVEN
TO FOCUS ON THE HUMAN BEINGS THAT MAKE UP SYRIA SO I BEGAN FILMING EVERYONE WHO CROSSED MY PATH SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING THE WORST TIME OF THEIR LIVES
HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON AGAINST
ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHOICES WE MAKE AND CAN BE EXCITING AND
AND WHO PUT ALL THEIR ENERGY INTO MAKING IT POSSIBLE
THIS CHAOS I SAW HOW ORDINARY PEOPLE HELP EACH OTHER OUT IT TOLD ME ALSO
WAR ALSO GAVE ME INCREDIBLE LIFE LESSONS
WHO HELPED ME HUMANIZE THIS CONFLICT I KNOW VERY
AT THE HEART OF THE WAR THERE ARE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
SOCIETY IS TRYING TO PRESERVE WHAT REMAINS OF HOPE
EVE 2017 IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT I'M LYING IN VERY COLD BED I'M WEARING
THAT TIME PASSES AND PEOPLE GO AWAY BEFORE ADDING THAT SHE MIGHT
LEFT BEGAN TO EXIST ELSEWHERE THAN JUST IN MY HEAD
WHEN PEOPLE FEEL THEY CAN DIE AT ANY TIME
ONE OF THE SAFEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IS
IT ALLOWED ME TO DISCOVER MY EMOTIONS AND MY REACTIONS
THOSE THINGS THROUGH ALL THE PEOPLE I'VE MET
WAS LOST BETWEEN THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN WHICH WAS VISIBLE ON PEOPLE'S FACES
THAT I HAD TO LIVE LIKE THE OTHERS
SHAKING BY THE TIME I GO TO THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING THE ELECTRICITY IS CUT OFF LEAVING ME WITHOUT INTERNET
TO COMMUNICATE THE SUFFERING OF THIS COUNTRY SO THAT OTHERS HERE COULD FEEL
THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING SO POWERFUL THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
BUT IT WILL NOT SUCCEED IN DESTROYING EVERYTHING DESPITE THE SCARS
ENOUGH TO CROSS THE PATH OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IN THIS PROJECT WHO
MY FEELINGS WERE MIXED BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE PRESENT
HAVE MET IN ANOTHER LIFE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSTANTLY IN MY
A CAMERA IN MY SUITCASE AND TO LOOK FOR THOSE MISSING IMAGES MYSELF
BLAMED MYSELF FOR LIVING IN SAFETY HERE AND FOR BEING ABLE TO CLOSE MY EYES WHEN I CAN NO LONGER SEE THE NIGHTMARE OVER THERE
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN SYRIA FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS HAS CHANGED MY LIFE MY WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS WAR THAT
ELECTRICITY GOES OUT FOR THE NEXT FIVE HOURS SUDDENLY I HEAR GUNSHOTS AND I
THEM THE ROAR OF THE PLANES AND THE WHISTLING OF
THE NO SIGN WAS PRETTY CLEAR THREE OF MY COLLEAGUES WENT AS FAR AS TO DRIVE ME TO AN OPEN AIR STRIKE
TO SHOW THE FULL FRAME OF UNSEEN STORIES OF
AIR RAID MANAGED TO DESTROY THE COMPOUND AND BREAK MY NOSE FOR A MOMENT ALL I SAW WAS WHITE BRIGHT WHITE LIKE THESE LIGHTS
I BECAME A WITNESS WITH A CHOICE TO RUN AWAY OR STAND STILL
WHEN I TURNED 19 I STARTED MY CAREER AS THE FIRST FEMALE PHOTOJOURNALIST IN THE GAZA STRIP
MY COLLEAGUES' ACTION WAS NOT THE ONLY DEATH THREAT I HAVE RECEIVED BUT IT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS ONE
THE THREE OF THEM GOT BACK INTO THE ARMORED JEEP AND DROVE AWAY WAVING AND LAUGHING LEAVING ME BEHIND IN THE OPEN AIR STRIKE ZONE
HAD TOLD US TO GO SOMEWHERE BY A CERTAIN DEADLINE AND WE BELIEVED HIM AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVED HIM WE DID IT
PEOPLE ASK ME THAT QUESTION ALL THE TIME AND I FIND SOMETHING A LITTLE WEIRD ABOUT IT IT'S NOT WEIRD THAT THEY ASKED ME THE QUESTION IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK THAT QUESTION WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
NOW
WE'RE NOT GONNA VISIT ANY OF THOSE PLANETS IN MY LIFETIME
PROBABLY NOT IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFETIME BUT SOME DAY WE WILL
IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE MADE THOSE DECISIONS TO EXPLORE NOW
SCIENTISTS HAVE TAUGHT US LARGELY FROM DATA THEY'VE GOTTEN FROM SPACE EXPLORATION THAT WE LIVE IN AN EXPANDING
AND YOUR MONEY WHETHER YOU'RE A TAXPAYER AND IF YOU'RE A US TAXPAYER YOU CONTRIBUTE ABOUT ONE DOLLAR A WEEK TO THE NASA BUDGET
WE'VE BECOME THANKS TO THE INTERNET A CULTURE OF BUZZFEED LISTICLES AND A TOP 10 REASONS WHY WE GO TO SPACE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GIVE THE TOP 10 REASONS WHY WE GO TO SPACE BECAUSE AFTER ALL THERE SEVEN BILLIONS OF US
PERSONALLY I'M LESS MOTIVATED BY THE ONES THAT ARE ABOUT FEAR AND I'M MUCH MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE ONES THAT ARE ABOUT OPPORTUNITY ABOUT HOPE
ME THAT NUMBER IS OVERWHELMINGLY LARGE
IN FACT I'M SO OVERWHELMED THAT I CANNOT PUT THAT NUMBER INTO CONTEXT I DON'T EXACTLY WALK AROUND WITH 135 BILLION DOLLARS IN MY WALLET I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU COULD DO WITH THAT MONEY I DON'T KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY WAS IT WORTH IT UNLESS YOU CAN COMPARE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE
ARE AN INNOVATOR AND ENTREPRENEUR IN THE SPACE COMMUNITY WHETHER YOU'RE AN ENGINEER WHO DECIDED TO TAKE THAT JOB AT
BORDERS WE DRAW ON MAPS ARE USUALLY IMAGINARY LINES BUT SEEING IT WITH YOUR OWN
GUESS THAT MEANS THAT WE AS HUMANITY ARE THROWING IN THE TOWEL
AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO EXPLORE SPACE EVER AGAIN THAT WAS THE PREVAILING STORY IN THE MEDIA THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT
A LOT OF PEOPLE
REASON I FELL IN LOVE WITH SPACE AS A KID AND I'M JUST AS IN LOVE WITH IT TODAY IS BECAUSE GOING TO
INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD OR ANY OF THE NUMBER OF OTHER WORTHY FIELDS WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO DO THAT
BECAUSE OUR EYES IN THE SKY WHETHER THEY'RE ROBOTIC OR HUMANS WERE TELLING US HEY EVERYBODY LOOK OUT YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
I'D LIKE YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WITH ME IMAGINE RIGHT AFTER YOU WATCH THIS TALK YOU LEAVE HERE AND YOU GO TO THE CLOSEST AIRPORT AND YOU PARK YOURSELF AT LAX FOR AN HOUR
AND YOU ASK EVERYONE GETTING OFF A PLANE WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY TO COME TO LOS ANGELES
WHEN YOU CAN DO SPACE IN THE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR MEGA LABORATORY AND YOU CAN DO IT IN THE SMARTPHONE WORLD
IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME THAT QUESTION MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE CULTURAL MEMORIES OF JFK IN THAT FAMOUS SPEECH THEY EXPECT ME TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN A SOUND BITE OR ACTUALLY NOW IN A TWEET
BIT MORE ATTENTION IN SCHOOL TO SEEK THAT EXTRA TUTORING
TO SPEND ANOTHER YEAR IN COLLEGE
AND THEN THEY GO ON TO BECOME A GENETICIST OR A COMPUTER SCIENTIST OR AN APP DEVELOPER OR WHATEVER IT IS I THINK THAT'S STILL A WONDERFULLY WORTHY GOAL AND I STILL THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUELY POWERFUL ABOUT SPACE BECAUSE WE
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE HE SAYS WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON AND DO THESE OTHER THINGS IN THIS DECADE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD
AND KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE EXPLORING SPACE
I HAVE LOT OF REASONS NOT JUST ONE AND I'M ONLY ONE PERSON MY REASONS TO GO TO
AFTER JFK GAVE THAT FAMOUS SPEECH I'LL NOTE BY THE WAY ONLY ON THE FINAL MISSION DID WE ACTUALLY TAKE A SCIENTIST
HAD THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY THROUGHOUT ALL OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT TO MAYBE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT TO SEE OUR DOOM COMING TO SAY NO WE CAN STOP THAT BUT OF THE PRESUMABLY INFINITE NUMBERS OF
VERY DIFFERENT AND BECAUSE OF PHOTOGRAPHS LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE SEND ASTRONAUTS AND WE SEND SATELLITES AND
TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN KNOW THAT AT THE END OF A REALLY SUCCESSFUL BAKE SALE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT CAN SEND A PAYLOAD INTO SPACE THAT'S A GAME CHANGER WE'RE TO THE POINT
ARE NOW SO MANY NOT JUST TWO THERE ARE SO MANY COUNTRIES
THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY WE HAVE AN OLD JOKE THAT SAYS THAT ASTEROIDS ARE JUST MOTHER NATURE'S WAY OF SAYING {LG}
IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR US TO THINK THAT BECAUSE LOS ANGELES IS A BIG WONDERFUL DIVERSE CITY WITH SO MANY THINGS TO DO AND EVERYONE ON THAT PLANE SHOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT REASON WELL IF YOU THINK LOS ANGELES IS BIG
ROCKETS WERE BIGGER THAN THEIRS BUT
I RESEARCH HOW TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY PAIN AND I TEACH OTHER DOCTORS WHY PATIENTS' PAIN MATTERS
AND PATIENTS NEED TO BECOME EMPOWERED IN WAYS THAT MATTER
EXACTLY HOW MUCH ADULT NEEDLE PHOBIA COSTS SOCIETY
BECAUSE HOW ELSE ARE WE GOING TO EVALUATE THE RISK BENEFIT OF NEW VACCINES
AND
WE NEED TO STUDY HOW TO MAKE KIDS WHO ARE AFRAID OF NEEDLES
GET OVER IT
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE DO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH
BUTT IS BURNING FROM BEING STUNG BY A WASP NOW OPEN YOUR EYES YOU KEEP GETTING
BREEZE BLOWING THE POLLEN COUNT IS LOW {LG}
COULD WORK TOGETHER TO SPACE OUT SHOTS
SO THAT THEY'RE NOT SO OVERWHELMING ALL AT ONCE THE
DRUG COMPANIES ARE ALREADY WORKING TO PUT MORE VACCINES INTO A SINGLE SHOT
BUT MORE VOCAL SUPPORT FROM PARENTS AND DOCTORS COULD ACCELERATE THE POLICIES THAT WILL REIMBURSE FOR THAT KIND OF SHOT
GOALS THEY'RE QUESTIONING VACCINATING ITSELF AND BY IGNORING PAIN WE'RE
YOU DIDN'T DO MY CLOSE YOUR EYES EXERCISE IF YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR AND IT TAKES THEM 5 TIMES TO DRAW BLOOD
I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD YOU ARE WITH SHOTS YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THAT VISIT
THE RISE OF NEEDLE PHOBIA ISN'T THEORETICAL
SO WHY WERE PARENTS ALREADY SKEPTICAL ABOUT VACCINATING ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VACCINES BUT OK WITH THE ONE VACCINE THAT CAUSED THE DISEASE
FLASH FORWARD TO MAX WHO IS NOW 16
NOW EVEN IF THEY REFUSED SOME SHOTS
THE VACCINE THAT WAS LEAST REFUSED WAS POLIO THE
PAPER DIDN'T SAY WHY
BUT IF YOU KNOW ABOUT VACCINES
WELL
THAT'S PECULIAR
SEE HERE'S HOW VACCINES WORK
TO GET HEALTHCARE
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO DONATE BLOOD
AND THEY'RE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO VACCINATE THEIR OWN KIDS
SO WHEN THESE CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN IN 2000 OR LATER
ARE OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE THEMSELVES TO THE DOCTOR
WHAT IF THEY DON'T
WHAT IF THEY SIMPLY DON'T FIND OUT THAT THEY HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
WHAT IF THEY DON'T CATCH CANCER EARLY
DON'T GET ME WRONG FROM AN INDIVIDUAL DISEASE STANDPOINT
VACCINES
ROCK
WE HAVE REDUCED PREVENTABLE DISEASES BY 98
I PERSONALLY SAW KIDS DIE IN RESIDENCY
FROM THINGS THAT WE CAN PREVENT NOW
BUT
THE NUMBER OF SHOTS THAT WE'RE
WATCHING YOUR KID GET STUCK OVER AND OVER AND OVER
FEELS WRONG
I MEAN DUH YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HURT KIDS ON PURPOSE
AS IT BECOMES HARDER TO REMEMBER
THE DANGERS AND DEATHS FROM THESE DISEASES
IT'S BECOMING SOCIALLY EASIER FOR PARENTS TO JUST REFUSE
AT THE TIME REFUSING A VACCINE HAS NO CONSEQUENCES
YOU DON'T WATCH YOUR KID GET STUCK
THEY DON'T DEVELOP MEASLES OVERNIGHT
AND IF YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT GUILTY YOU CAN GO ON THE INTERNET AND FIND LOTS OF REASONS WHY YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL
AFTER THAT
IT'S HARD TO LOGIC
OF THE WORLD'S PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PAIN MEDICINES FOR ADULTS
BUT ONLY 6 OF PEDIATRICIANS GIVE PAIN MEDICATION FOR SHOTS AND
THAT INCLUDES TYLENOL
HOW HAVE WE SUPPRESSED OUR EMPATHY THAT WE DECIDE THAT THE MOST PAINFUL EVENT IN A KID'S LIFE UP TO THAT POINT
ISN'T WORTH TREATING
IT ISN'T EVEN WORTH ACKNOWLEDGING
SO
I THINK THAT THE REASON WE HAVE THIS BLIND SPOT IS
WE ACTUALLY CAN'T HAVE
NOT GO IF A FEAR OF NEEDLES WERE GROWING AND IF IT WERE PERVASIVE ENOUGH TO THREATEN PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE
US
FINALLY WE NEED TO QUIT TREATING FEAR AS FAILURE
MEDICINE CAUSED THIS
BUT WE CAN FIX
IT PARENTS
RIGHT NOW CAN LEARN HOW TO DISTRACT
THEY CAN LEARN HOW TO ADVOCATE WITH THEIR PEDIATRICIAN FOR PAIN CONTROL AND
THEY CAN HAVE AN OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT PAIN AND FEAR
PAIN IN LIFE IS UNAVOIDABLE I GOT USED TO THIS IDEA IN MEDICAL SCHOOL BECAUSE SOMETIMES I HAD TO CAUSE PAIN BUT MAKING SOMETHING
TO BE WHAT'S UP WITH THAT WELL RESEARCH IN 2005 DAN
ASHAMED I GUESS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS I RESPONDED TO THIS EXPERIENCE BY INVENTING A
SHOTS BETTER IT'S NOT OK FOR SHOTS TO HURT BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A HURRY
THE POLIO VACCINE WAS ORAL
MAYBE IT WASN'T THE VACCINE
MAYBE IT WAS THE SHOT
EVEN TODAY THE LEAST REFUSED VACCINE IS ROTAVIRUS WHICH IS
ORAL
SOMETHING DANGEROUS AND POWERFUL IS HAPPENING IN PUBLIC HEALTH
NUMBER
AND THE WAY WE'RE GIVING SHOTS IS CAUSING NEEDLE FEAR
NEEDLE FEAR
CAUSES PEOPLE TO AVOID HEALTHCARE AS ADULTS
AND THE NUMBER AND THE WAY WE'RE GIVING SHOTS IS CAUSING PARENTS TO QUESTION WHETHER THEY AND THEIR DOCTORS HAVE THE SAME
GOAL
BUT PARENTS AND DOCTORS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE
WE BOTH WANT TO KEEP OUR KIDS AND OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTHY
BUT
WE THINK WE'VE BEEN IN THAT PLACE AND WE GOT SHOTS AND WE'RE NOT WIMPS ABOUT IT
TOUGHEN UP RIGHT
THE TRUTH IS
YOU CAN'T HAVE BEEN IN THESE KIDS' PLACE
IF YOU WERE BORN BEFORE 1983
BEFORE
I COULDN'T EVEN PRETEND TO MY SON THAT THIS WAS HOW I INTENDED FOR HIM TO GET HIS SHOTS IT WAS OBVIOUS
KNOWING ALL THESE THINGS I END UP WITH A FINISHED COMPOSITION
SINGLE EGG IS UNIQUE LIKE A SNOWFLAKE IS UNIQUE IT NEVER
AND REMAINS SHELLS AND BONES AND FEATHERS AND TISSUE AND THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF MAN'S HUBRIS
HAD LITTLE BUTTONS DOWN THE FRONT THE THYLACINE'S PROBABLY THE MOST MALIGNED AND MISUNDERSTOOD
BUT REALLY IT'S THE STORY OF EACH SPECIES THAT MAKES ME WANT TO PRESERVE THE IMAGES OF THE
SPECIES I THINK WE NEED ALL THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL IN ORDER TO AFFECT SOME REAL REPAIR TO THE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT
THE CAT'S GLEE CAUSE THEY COULDN'T REALLY FLY VERY WELL THIS IS THE XERCES BLUE
SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION AND OFTEN THAT REALLY IS MORE DIAGNOSTIC THAN DESCRIPTIVE
LOSS IN PEOPLE'S MINDS ACROSS TIME MOST OF THE SPECIES WERE DRAWN
THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAUSED THAT DISRUPTION THEY'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY SALTATION AND DAMS AND WATER POLLUTION BUT
EACH PAINTING EXPLORES THE THEME IN BIODIVERSITY SUCH AS ENDANGERMENT BLACK AND GREY MARKET
THE LAST 30 YEARS OR SO I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF STUDYING THE LIVES OF
IN SOUVENIR SHOPS EXTINCTION IS IRREVERSIBLE AND YET YOU MAY WONDER WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT SPECIES LET ME TELL YOU
AND THEN WATCH THE LITTLE ANIMALS IN THERE THE LITTLE SPECIES AND THE SO PEOPLE CARE ABOUT SPECIES BECAUSE THEIR JOBS DEPEND ON SPECIES AND OTHERS CARE ABOUT SPECIES
ON A SHRUB
BUT THEN SHE SAW A MALE BABOON THAT WAS COMING FROM BEHIND MUCH CLOSER TO THE SHRUB WAS GOING TO GET THE BEETLE
AND THE FEMALE IMMEDIATELY UTTERED THIS CRY
WHICH IN BABOON LANGUAGE MEANS HELP THIS MALE IS ATTACKING ME HELP
I KNOW HE WASN'T
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE TROOP PARTICULARLY RELATIVES OF THAT FEMALE CAME DOWN FROM THE TREES AND CHARGED AT THE MALE
EVERY CITIZEN OF THE WORLD TODAY IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WILD SPECIES OR THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEN ENJOY SPECIES SHOULDN'T WE ALL CARE AND DO OUR SHARE
TERRIFIED ON THE FOREST FLOOR
AND
THEN FRODO WALKED AWAY
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO CATCH MY BREATH
AND FINALLY TO POSE THE QUESTION WELL
THERE WAS FRODO'S COMPASSION TOWARDS ME WHERE IS MY COMPASSION TOWARDS ALL THOSE CREATURES THAT I SO MUCH ADMIRE WHAT IS MY ROLE WHAT IS MY DUTY HERE
AND I DECIDED TO BECOME ONE OF THE VOICES THAT PROTECTS THEM FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES THAT COMPROMISE THEIR SURVIVAL
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THESE CREATURES MANY MANY SPECIES I CONSIDER
INTELLIGENT
WITH EMOTIONS
MANY OF THEM WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF AWARENESS
I ONCE SAW A FEMALE
YEARS AGO WERE SPENDING 4 1 BILLION DOLLARS TO GO INTO THE
YOU WILL BE OF COURSE LOOKING AT RENEWABLES SOLAR WIND POWER OTHERS MINIMIZING YOUR CO2 EMISSIONS AND MINIMIZING THEREBY YOUR IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE
RAN AWAY
BUT I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY ASK MR DAS I MEAN HOW COULD YOU
JUST SHOOT INTO THE GROUND INSTEAD OF SHOOTING AT THIS ANIMAL IN A SITUATION OF LIFE OR DEATH
BUT MR DAS RESPONDED VERY CONFIDENTLY
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN KAZIRANGA FOR 24 YEARS
AND NEVER AN ANIMAL HAS HARMED ME WHAT WOULD GIVE ME THE RIGHT TO HARM THIS TIGRESS
AND INDEED THE FAMILY OF MR DAS HAS BEEN LIVING FOR 24 YEARS OFF THE JOB OF MR DAS AS A RANGER OFF THE WILDLIFE OF KAZIRANGA NATIONAL PARK AND MR DAS CARED VERY GENUINELY
ABOUT THE WILDLIFE ABOUT THE SPECIES
I
AND THE ONLY THING LEFT OF THE COSTA RICAN GOLDEN TOAD ARE THESE POST CARDS WHICH YOU CAN
RUN FOR HIS LIFE
AND ALL OF THEM CHASED HIM INTO THE DISTANCE EXCEPT FOR ONE THE FEMALE BABOON
SHE STAYED BEHIND SNATCHED THE BEETLE AND STARTED MUNCHING ON IT AS SHE WATCHED THE OTHERS DISAPPEAR IN A CLOUD OF DUST
NOW YES I KNOW
MANY OF YOU MANY OF US WILL NOT HAVE OFTEN A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THIS KIND TO MOTIVATE OUR CONSERVATION ACTION
AND THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT IN THE STORES WHERE WE BUY OUR FURNITURE
AND THEN MEDICINE
THOUSANDS OF DRUGS
COME ORIGINALLY FROM WILD SPECIES OF PLANTS AND INSECTS
THEN SYNTHESIZED IN THE LABORATORIES AND PACKAGED NICELY IN CARDBOARD BOXES SO THAT WE CAN VERY COMFORTABLY ENJOY THEM
ORGANIZED CRIMINAL GANGS ARE BRIBING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE JUDICIARY AND CUSTOMS TO GET THE IVORY ACROSS TO ASIA SOME INSURGENT GROUPS LIKE AL SHABAAB BOKO HARAM
AND SUSTAINING 600 MILLION JOBS ASSOCIATED TO FISHERIES AND SEAFOOD PROCESSING BUT THEN THERE IS TIMBER AS WELL A COMMODITY IN VERY HIGH DEMAND AROUND THE WORLD WELL TIMBER COMES FROM TREES AND TREES
FOR MANY PEOPLE SPECIES CONSERVATION AND CARING ABOUT IT IS AS SIMPLE AS
ANIMALS LIKE GORILLAS IN RWANDA GORILLA TOURISM IS A 300 MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY EVERY YEAR BENEFITING
THINKING OF THOSE IMAGES FROM TEXT BOOKS THAT I HAD READ ABOUT CHIMPS FIGHTING EACH OTHER AND SOMETIMES KILLING THE OPPONENT WITH A SINGLE BITE INTO THE SKULL SO I THOUGHT MY LIFE IS REALLY AT THE MERCY OF FRODO
NOW TELLING THE STORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE ARCTIC NOW ALL THESE ANIMALS REMEMBER HOW OUR EYES USED TO BLINK WHEN WE READ THE STORIES OF TARZAN AND
WALLACE COTTON
ANYTHING HAVING COTTON YOUR TOWELS WILL COME FROM PLANTATIONS THAT GO ABOUT VERY RESPONSIBLY WITH THE WATER IRRIGATION SO THAT WATER CONTINUES TO BE A RESOURCE THAT IS RELIABLE YEAR AFTER YEAR
AND YOUR ENERGY
I CARE 24 YEARS AGO I UNDERWENT A WATERSHED MOMENT IN MY LIFE WHEN I SURVIVED THE ATTACK BY A WILD MALE
ME FINISH BY INTRODUCING YOU A REMARKABLE MAN THAT I MET THREE YEARS
SO THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS NUMEROUS THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO HERE THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE VERY POSITIVELY TO SPECIES
NOW THERE IS MUCH MORE TO SPECIES CONSERVATION THAN FOOD HEALTH RAW MATERIALS SPIRITUAL
IF YOU RUN A RESTAURANT YOU WILL BE LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT THE SOURCING OF YOUR SEAFOOD YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR SHRIMP YOUR LOBSTER YOUR FISH ALL COME FROM SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES THAT DO NOT DEPLETE THE WORLD'S OCEANS YOU WOULD
TWO THIEVES BROKE INTO THE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE OF COIMBRA IN PORTUGAL THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE CASH THEY DIDN'T TOUCH THE COMPUTERS BUT THEY RAN AWAY WITH TWO 18TH CENTURY RHINO HORNS
DANGER IN THAT THE DOCTOR WAS SO HE LETS HIMSELF GLIDE DOWN THE BACK OF THE ELEPHANT AND THEN START SHOOTING INTO THE GROUND AND THAT DID THE TRICK THE TIGRESS WAS STARTLED
SHY AWAY FROM COUNTRIES PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION
AND AS ONE HIGH LEVEL OFFICIAL
OF GABON TOLD ME JUST A YEAR AGO
IF AN AFRICAN NATION LOSES ITS ELEPHANTS
IT WILL HAVE LOST ITS CAPACITY TO GOVERN
AND THEN I THINK OF THE SYMBOLIC VALUE OF SPECIES THOSE ANIMALS THAT APPEAR IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS WORLDWIDE USED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES GIVE ME AN ANIMAL WITH
IRRESPONSIBLE CONSUMER CHOICES HERE IF YOU
THINK OF ALL THOSE MARINE FISH FEEDING ABOUT ONE BILLION PEOPLE IN
PARK IN HIS MID 40S HE TOLD ME THE STORY OF THE TIME WHEN HE WAS RIDING ON THE BACK OF AN ELEPHANT AND IN FRONT OF HIM WAS THE VETERINARY DOCTOR
AND IN FRONT OF THE DOCTOR THE MAHOUT
WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING THIS ELEPHANT
THROUGH THE RICE PADDY FIELDS AROUND THE NATIONAL PARK
THEY WERE
THEY WANTED TO TRANQUILIZE THIS TIGRESS AND THEN MOVE HER TO A SAFER PLACE SO HERE THEY ARE ON THIS ELEPHANT MOVING ALONG THIS SEA OF GREEN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TIGRESS FURIOUS JUMPS OUT OF THE RICE PADDY AND LEAPS TWO
AND DEFINED NATURAL WORLD IT'S THE ORIGIN OF HUMAN KIND AND DEFINITELY WORLD HERITAGE WHICH I HOPE SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR
TO COME AND NOT JUST AS ILLUSTRATIONS IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS
PRODUCTS OF YOUR AVERAGE SUPERMARKET
AND ALL PALM PLANTATIONS HAVE BEEN EXPANDING VORACIOUSLY IN SOUTH EAST ASIA OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES SOMETIMES ENCROACHING ON NATURAL FORESTS AND ON NATIONAL PARKS THE HOMES OF ORANGUTANS OF TIGERS OF THE ASIAN ELEPHANT AND MANY OTHER UNIQUE SPECIES FROM SOUTH EAST ASIA
THE GOOD NEWS IS SOME INDUSTRY LEADERS ARE REALLY MAKING A STATEMENT NOW THAT THEIR PLANTATIONS
HAVE NOT ENCROACHED ON NATURAL FORESTS AND THAT THEY ARE SUSTAINABLY MANAGED IN ORDER NOT TO COMPROMISE THE LIFE OF SO MUCH WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY YOU CAN FIND A LITTLE LABEL HOPEFULLY IN MANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS IN SUPERMARKETS THAT WILL HELP YOU GUIDE YOUR PURCHASING DECISIONS
NOW LET'S FACE IT
WE ARE IN A SPECIES EXTINCTION CRISIS DRIVEN BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES
AND I MUST TELL YOU I WAS VERY SADDENED AND FRUSTRATED WHEN I ARRIVED IN COSTA RICA IN 1995
INDUSTRY IN 2012 HAD A TURNOVER OF 2 BILLION DOLLARS AND IT'S AN INDUSTRY GROWING AT ABOUT 10 A YEAR RECREATIONAL DIVERS
DIRECTLY FROM THE PHARMACY WITHOUT HAVING TO EMBARK ON A RAINFOREST EXPEDITION EVERY TIME WE FALL SICK
SO PEOPLE CARE ABOUT SPECIES BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT FOOD SECURITY
ABOUT HEALTH
AND ABOUT JOBS
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER LOT OF PEOPLE THEY CARE ABOUT SPECIES BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO GO TO THE WILD
IN THE WILDERNESS THEY EXPERIENCE MENTAL RELAXATION
SOME SPIRITUAL REPLENISHMENT SOMETIMES ARTISTIC INSPIRATION
AND IT ALL STARTS WITH YOUR SUNDAY WALK TO YOUR NEARBY FOREST
BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE YOU TO REMOTE PLACES TO WATCH
OF SERVING BLUE FIN TUNA SASHIMI GRADE FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF A DISASTER IN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
AND THEN YOU WILL LOOK AT YOUR STATIONARY
THE WOOD OF THE FURNITURE THE TIMBER YOU USE TO BUILD YOUR LODGE
BECAUSE THAT MUST COME
FROM CERTIFIED FORESTRY OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT
COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE NATURAL FORESTS
AND THEN YOUR TABLE
OUT TO THE MAHOUT AND HE LOST THREE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HAND ON THAT OCCASION THEN THE VETERINARY DOCTOR FALLS DOWN ON THE GROUND AND
HAVE TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS ARE USING THE SALES OF IVORY AS ONE MORE ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF CASH TO BUY SUPPLIES AND WEAPONS TO COMMIT THEIR ATROCITIES
SO IF YOU'RE A HEAD OF STATE IN AFRICA SPECIES CONSERVATION IS ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY
IT'S ABOUT AN ERODING RULE OF LAW
IT IS ABOUT LOST ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE SOME INVESTORS
SOURCE OF FOREIGN INCOME FOR RWANDA IN COSTA RICA ITS NATURE IS ITS PRIMARY ASSET FOR AN ECONOMY BASED PRIMARILY ON TOURISM AND THEN THERE IS WHALE WATCHING
I WAS COUNTING
AND THEN SOMETHING REMARKABLE HAPPENED FRODO STOPPED
AND FRODO STARTED GROOMING MY HAIR
IN A GESTURE OF APOLOGY
PERHAPS OF REMORSE AND CERTAINLY OF COMPASSION WITH THIS POOR GUY
THE HOMES OF THOUSANDS OF SPECIES WORLDWIDE AND YET I NEED TO ILLUSTRATE IT SO THAT YOU GET THE POINT
OF THE WORLD CAN POTENTIALLY DRIVE A SPECIES TOWARDS EXTINCTION ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE OCEAN ON ANOTHER CONTINENT
THE BAMBOOZLE BIKE HE RODE IT AROUND HIS NEIGHBORHOOD FOR ONE SUMMER I THINK AND HE TRIED TO RIDE IT ACROSS THE
FIBERGLASS AND IT WAS A CRAZY WEIRD WACKY BIKE AND HE CALLED IT THE BAMBOOZLER SO I CALLED
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE IN A BEAUTIFUL UNIVERSITY CITY AND BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE ENTRIES THAT WE'VE RECEIVED ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM AT UK UNIVERSITIES I WANT TO TAKE YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING REPORTED TO US OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THIS ALL STARTED AND I FIRST NOTICED A REAL SPIKE IN ACTIVITY TO THE WEBSITE THE FIRST TIME FRESHERS WEEK CAME AROUND SO
THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE WEBSITE HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN APRIL
SUDDENLY WHEN WE HIT FRESHERS WEEK I NOTICED THERE WAS A MASSIVE SURGE IN ENTRIES TO THE PROJECT
I REMEMBER IT STARTED I REMEMBER IT VIVIDLY WITH ONE EMAIL
IT CAME FROM A GIRL WHO WAS ABOUT TO START STUDYING PHYSICS AT A VERY HIGHLY RESPECTED LONDON UNIVERSITY
SHE FORWARDED ME AN EMAIL SHE'D RECEIVED FROM THE PHYSICS SOCIETY AT HER UNIVERSITY
AND THE EMAIL SAID FRESHERS LUNCH
THIS WILL BE MAINLY A CHANCE FOR YOU TO SCOPE OUT WHO'S IN YOUR DEPARTMENT AND STAKE YOUR CLAIM EARLY ON THE ONE IN FIVE GIRLS
SHE WROTE THAT SHE WAS GOING INTO AN INCREDIBLY MALE DOMINATED AREA ALREADY
AND SO HERE THE BOYS IN HER YEAR HER MALE PEERS WERE BEING SENT THE MESSAGE FROM A UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED SOCIETY NO LESS
TO VIEW THEIR FEMALE PEERS WHO WERE IN THE MINORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR COURSE VERY MUCH AS SEXUAL PREY
THIS WAS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING SO MANY MESSAGES AND STORIES STARTED COMING IN
OFTEN THEY WERE ABOUT FRESHERS WEEK AND EVENTS GOING ON IN FRESHERS WEEK SO I ACTUALLY STARTED HAVING A LOOK AT THE EVENTS THAT WERE SCHEDULED AT UK UNIVERSITIES THAT YEAR
ABOUT WOMEN AND THEIR PLACE THAT ARE BEING DRUMMED INTO THEM FROM THE VERY FIRST WEEK OF UNIVERSITY
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THESE THINGS DO SOMETIMES HAPPEN TO BOYS TOO WE HAD ONE ENTRY FROM A FRESHER MAN WHO WAS FORCED TO WATCH PORN IN HIS UNDERWEAR WHILE A FRESHER WOMAN WAS TOLD TO SIT IN HIS LAP TO SEE IF HE GOT AN ERECTION
BUT IN THE MAIN THE STORIES INCLUDING THE ONES FROM MEN CAME IN BECAUSE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEIR FEMALE PEERS SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT THIS SEXUALIZED ASPECT AND OFTEN THIS UNDERCURRENT OF MISOGYNY OF
MAKING THE GIRLS DO THINGS THAT WERE EMBARRASSING OR DEGRADING FOCUS MUCH MORE ON WOMEN THE MEN'S INITIATIONS SEEMED TO FOCUS MUCH MORE ON THINGS LIKE DRINKING EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL OR HAVING TO EAT DISGUSTING COMBINATIONS OF FOOD
FEMALE STUDENT WHO WROTE TO ME SAID I DON'T FIND IT FUNNY THESE PAGES ARE NOT PAGES FOR JOKES THERE ARE NO PUNCHLINES THEY'RE NOT SEXIST JOKES JUST DISPLAYS OF SEXISM DISPLAYS OF MISOGYNY
I FIND IT THREATENING I FIND IT TERRIFYING
THIS IS NOT BANTER
SHE ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS BECAUSE SHE SAID I'M AFRAID OF THESE PEOPLE
I'M AFRAID THESE ATTITUDES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE EBBING AWAY ARE COMING BACK WITH FORCE I'M AFRAID THAT BY TAKING A STAND AGAINST PAGES LIKE THIS I WILL MARK MYSELF AS A TARGET
AGAIN THESE AREN'T ISOLATED INCIDENTS THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE NEWSPAPER FELIX PRINTED A JOKE ARTICLE WHICH PROVIDED MALE STUDENTS WITH THE RECIPE FOR THE DATE RAPE DRUG ROHYPNOL BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS A FOOL PROOF WAY TO HAVE SEX ON VALENTINE'S DAY FOR CHEAPER THAN THE PRICE OF A HOOKER
AND TALKING ABOUT CULTURE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE TERM RAPE CULTURE USED RECENTLY
IT'S USED TO DESCRIBE A CULTURE IN WHICH RAPE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARE COMMON AND IN WHICH PREVALENT ATTITUDES NORMS PRACTICES AND MEDIA NORMALIZE EXCUSE TOLERATE OR EVEN CONDONE RAPE
ONLINE THIS FREQUENTLY FOCUSES ON THE STUDENTS AND YOUNG WOMEN THANKS TO WEBSITES LIKE UNILAD THE LAD BIBLE AND CONFESSIONS OF A UNI STUDENT
I'M TALKING ABOUT ENTIRE WEBSITES WHERE EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THE ARTICLES ARE ABOUT WOMEN YOU WON'T SEE A SINGLE FEMALE NAME
BECAUSE THEY ARE REPLACED WITH WENCHES HOES CLUNGES SKANKS SLOPPY SECONDS PUSSY TRAMP CHICK BIRD MILF SLUT AND GASH
THEY'RE PART OF A GROWING CULTURE IN WHICH THE SEXUAL TARGETING OF FEMALE STUDENTS AS PREY IS ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED EVEN WHEN IT VERGES ON SEXUAL ASSAULT IT'S AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH VICTIMS SILENCED AND PERPETRATORS ENCOURAGED TO SEE CRIMES MERELY AS BANTER
JUST PART OF BEING A LAD
THESE ARE WEBSITES WITH ARTICLES SAYING THINGS LIKE
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF RAPE CASES GO UNREPORTED THAT SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY GOOD ODDS
WEBSITES WHICH DESCRIBE FEMALE STUDENT WHO HAS SAID SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU AS A KNOBSTACLE COURSE JUST A GAME TO GET AROUND WEBSITES WHERE POSTERS TALKING ABOUT SMASHING A VIRGIN AND HAVING BLOOD STAINS TO PROVE IT
WHEN CRITICIZED THESE SITES IN THEIR OWN WORDS TEND TO SAY GET A FUCKING GRIP WE'RE HAVING A BIT OF HARMLESS BANTER
A RECENT POST THAT APPEARED ON ONE OF THEIR FACEBOOK PAGES DESCRIBES A GRAPHIC INCIDENT OF A MAN KNOCKING A WOMAN CLEAN OUT WITH ONE SMACK AND LEAVING HER FOR DEAD ON THE SIDE OF THE
ROAD YET THIS WORD BANTER THIS CLOAK OF IRONY IS BEING USED TO EXCUSE MAINSTREAM HORRIFIC SEXISM THE NORMALIZATION AND BELITTLING OF RAPE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT'S A VERY CLEVER WAY OF SILENCING BECAUSE IF SOMETHING'S A JOKE IT'S VERY HARD TO
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
BUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT IT IN UNIVERSITIES YOUNG WOMEN COME UP TO ME AFTERWARDS SAYING THAT CAN'T BE SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE IT'S NORMAL
THAT CAN'T BE ASSAULT BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AM OUT WITH MY FRIENDS
THERE'S A MASSIVE GAP BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED FROM UNDER THE LAW AND WHAT SOCIETY TELLS WOMEN PARTICULARLY YOUNG WOMEN PARTICULARLY AT UNIVERSITY IS JUST PART OF LIFE AND JUST SOMETHING THEY OUGHT TO BE PUTTING UP WITH
BUT WE CAN SAY NO WE CAN STAND UP AND WE CAN SHOUT BACK
WE HAVE TO START NOW NO MEANS NO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU'RE WEARING WHERE YOU ARE WHO YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH IN THE PAST OR WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN FLIRTING DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW IF IT'S LATE OR IF YOU'RE DRUNK NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO TOUCH YOU SEXUALLY WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO TO PLAY YOUR PART
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE NEED A CULTURAL SHIFT IN ATTITUDES IN THE WAY THAT WE PERCEIVE WOMEN AND EVERYBODY CAN BE A PART OF THAT WE CAN PETITION STUDENT UNIONS AND CLUBS TO TAKE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY TOWARDS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND GROPING
WE CAN SPEAK UP ABOUT CONSENT AND TRY TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE NORMALIZED ASSUMPTIONS WE CAN SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED TO FEEL ABLE TO REPORT IT IF THEY WANT TO
WE CAN ALL PLAY A PART IN INFLUENCING THESE SOCIAL NORMS AND THE CULTURE AROUND US NOT LETTING THE SMALL STUFF SLIDE BECAUSE IT'S THOSE MINOR INCIDENTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SAME ATTITUDES ABOUT WOMEN THAT LEAD TO THE BIGGER ISSUES HAPPENING
CALLING WOMEN SLUTS AND SLAGS GIVING THEM MARKS OUT OF TEN DEHUMANIZES THEM JOKING ABOUT RAPE AND ASSAULT NORMALIZES IT SO WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP AND OUR VOICES ARE LOUDEST WHEN WE RAISE THEM TOGETHER THANK
YOU
FROM ONE GIRL WHO SAID THERE WAS A GROUP OF LADS AT HER UNIVERSITY THAT STARTED AN ANONYMOUS PAGE WHERE THEY TALKED ABOUT GIRLS WHO WERE EATING AT THE CANTEEN
BUT SHE SAID BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS DOING IT SHE HAD CHOICE TO MAKE BETWEEN NOT EATING NOT GOING TO THE CANTEEN OR RISKING THAT HER PICTURE WOULD END UP ON FACEBOOK WITH PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT COMING ALL OVER HER BREASTS
ON FACEBOOK AS WELL THIS BANTER ABOUT ABUSE AND VIOLENCE AND OTHER PLACES ONLINE HAS ALSO PROLIFERATED IN RECENT YEARS
THESE NEXT SLIDES MAY BE VERY DISTRESSING SO THEY COME WITH A TRIGGER WARNING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AWAY THIS BITCH DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP DO YOU THAT WILL
TEACH YOU
SEEN THE VIDEO OF LADS ON THE BUS JOKING AND LAUGHING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABOUT MISCARRIAGES AND THE BOYS WHO WENT OUT IN CASUAL RAPE T SHIRTS ALL IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE SO WHY DOES ALL THIS MATTER WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
WE'VE SEEN A FRESHERS WEEK POSTER AT ONE UNIVERSITY THAT HAD PICTURE ON IT OF A T SHIRT WITH THE WORDS LAST NIGHT I WAS RAPING A WOMAN AND SHE CRIED WE'VE SEEN STUDENTS
THE WAY THROUGH WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND EVEN RAPE
I SET THE PROJECT UP JUST UNDER TWO YEARS AGO AND WE'VE NOW RECEIVED 50 000 ENTRIES FROM WOMEN OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE ALL OVER THE WORLD
BUT ONE THING REALLY SHOCKED ME AND TOOK ME ABACK ABOUT THE ENTRIES THAT STARTED TO FLOOD IN IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE PROJECT
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE PEOPLE OFTEN ASK WHAT WERE THE MOST SHOCKING ENTRIES I THINK THEY EXPECT ME TO REPLY THAT
TO SHE'D HAVE SAID SOMETHING AGAIN THIS IS ALL PART OF THE NORMALIZATION OF A SOCIETY IN WHICH WE JOKE ABOUT RAPE A SOCIETY IN WHICH SEXUAL ASSAULT IS JUST SOMETHING TO LAUGH ABOUT JUST BANTER JUST PART OF BEING A LAD
AGAINST THAT BACKDROP WE GET STORIES LIKE THESE A MALE STUDENT AT UNIVERSITY WITH ME OUTRIGHT TOLD ME I WAS HAVING SEX WITH HIM THAT NIGHT
HE WAS CALLING ME A SLAG A SLUT AND A WHORE HE STRADDLED HIMSELF ACROSS MY LEGS AND STARTED PINNING ME AGAINST THE SEAT FORCING KISSES ON ME AND SAYING NOW I'VE GOT YOU
ANOTHER STUDENT SAID I WAS RAPED IN MY SECOND YEAR OF UNIVERSITY I HAD SOME GREAT SUPPORT FROM MY FAMILY AND SOME GREAT THERAPY
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE WORST PART BUT WHEN I FELT SAFE ENOUGH TO TELL MY FRIENDS THE QUESTIONS STARTED
WAS I DRUNK
WAS I DRESSED SLUTTILY
DID I KNOW HIM
HAD I LED HIM ON
IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT BOUNDARIES BEGIN TO BECOME SO BLURRED THAT PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF WHAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED FROM
I OFTEN SPEAK IN UNIVERSITIES ALL UP AND DOWN THE UK AND I HAVE A SLIDE WHICH SIMPLY SAYS THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT UNDER UK LAW
GIRL WROTE TO US IN A PROJECT ENTRY
ONE OF THE FRESHERS EVENTS ORGANIZED BY OUR HALLS OF RESIDENCE WAS A GIRLS AND GUYS PUB CRAWL
WE WERE SPLIT INTO ONE GROUP OF GIRLS AND ONE OF GUYS AND EACH GROUP WENT OFF ON DIFFERENT PUB CRAWL ROUTES
ALL THE GIRLS WERE ENCOURAGED TO WEAR PINK AND DRESS SLUTTY
WE HAD TO COME UP WITH SLUT NAME WHICH THE OLDER STUDENTS ENCOURAGED US TO WRITE ACROSS OUR BREASTS
UPON ARRIVING AT EACH BAR AN OLDER STUDENT WOULD SHOUT OUT A WORD WHICH WAS CODE FOR US TO EITHER FLASH OUR TITS OR OUR ARSE OR DANCE IN A SEDUCTIVE WAY IN FRONT OF THE MEN IN THE PUB
I DIDN'T TAKE PART IN THIS AND DIDN'T WANT TO ADOPT SLUT NAME I WAS TOLD I WAS BEING TOO UPTIGHT AND NOT GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT OF FRESHERS WEEK
THE WHOLE THING CULMINATED IN THE GIRLS AND GUYS MEETING UP IN THE STUDENT UNION WHERE WE WERE INFORMED THE OLDER STUDENTS HAD ORGANIZED A COMPETITION WITH PRIZES
ONE PRIZE WAS FOR THE SLUT' WHO COLLECTED THE MOST TIES FROM THE GUYS THE OTHER WAS FOR THE LAD WHO COLLECTED THE MOST BRAS FROM THE SLUTS I WALKED OUT ON A SCENE OF GROUPS OF DRUNK MALE STUDENTS FORCEFULLY TAKING OFF FEMALE STUDENT'S BRAS
ANOTHER ENTRY SAID I WENT OUT FOR THE FRESHERS NIGHT OF ONE OF THE WOMEN'S SPORTS CLUBS
OUR GROUP BUMPED INTO THE MEN'S RUGBY CLUB IN A BAR
THEY WERE PUTTING THEIR FRESHERS THROUGH THEIR INITIATION CEREMONY ALL THE RUGBY FRESHERS HAD THEIR TROUSERS AROUND THEIR ANKLES AND WERE STANDING IN THEIR BOXERS
THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO PICK ONE OF US TO GRIND WITH THEM ONE GUY GRABBED ME PULLED ME ON THE DANCE FLOOR THEN TOLD ME I HAD TO GRIND ON HIM OR ELSE HE'D HAVE TO DO A FORFEIT WHEN I REFUSED HE TOLD ME I WAS FRIGID AND GRABBED A DIFFERENT FRESHER
ON THE ONE HAND I FELT ASHAMED AND EMBARRASSED I FELT TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO PARTAKE FULLY IN WHAT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE FUN OF FRESHERS WEEK
ON THE OTHER I WAS KIND OF ASHAMED THAT I'D TAKEN PART IN IT AT ALL
IT RUINED MY FRESHERS WEEK AND LEFT ME FEELING ISOLATED AND HUMILIATED
PERCENT WERE STALKED AND 68 WERE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
IT ALSO MATTERS BECAUSE MOST PERPETRATORS WERE KNOWN TO THE VICTIMS
AND MOST PERPETRATORS WERE STUDENTS
IT MATTERS MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE ONLY FOUR PERCENT OF THE FEMALE STUDENTS WHO WERE SERIOUSLY SEXUALLY ASSAULTED REPORTED IT TO THEIR ACADEMIC INSTITUTION AND ONLY TEN PERCENT FELT ABLE TO REPORT IT TO THE POLICE
WHEN THEY WERE GIVING THEIR REASONS FOR THESE LOW REPORTING RATES THEY WERE ASKED WHY DIDN'T YOU FEEL ABLE TO REPORT WHAT HAPPENED
FIFTY PERCENT SAID THEY DIDN'T REPORT IT BECAUSE THEY WERE ASHAMED OR EMBARRASSED AND 43 PERCENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE BLAMED FOR WHAT HAPPENED
SUDDENLY IMPORTANTLY THIS IS WHERE WE COME BACK TO THE FRESHERS WEEK JOKES AND THE INITIATIONS THE SLAG SLUT HOE SLAPPER LABELS THE PRESSURE ON FEMALE STUDENTS TO DRESS IN A CERTAIN WAY OFTEN BY UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED NIGHTS IDEAS THEY'RE PRESSURIZED TO PERPETUATE THE BANTEROUS GAMES ABOUT CHASING FEMALE STUDENTS DOWN HUNTING THEM STRIPPING THEIR BRAS
AT ALMOST EVERY EVENT THE TITLE SENDS THE MESSAGE USUALLY AT EVENTS THAT WERE SPONSORED BY OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UNIVERSITIES THESE STUDENTS WERE STUDYING AT THAT MEN ARE CEOS PROS GEEKS THEY'RE POWERFUL TALENTED INTELLIGENT WHILST WOMEN WERE BEING VALUED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY THEIR SEXUALIZATION ALONE
THE MESSAGES WE RECEIVED WERE SUGGESTING THAT THIS CREATED A REALLY SERIOUS SENSE OF PRESSURE FOR YOUNG WOMEN TO DRESS IN A CERTAIN WAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS WAS NOT ABOUT A KIND OF PRUDISH MORALITY BAN IT WASN'T SAYING WOMEN SHOULDN'T DRESS IN THAT WAY IF THEY WANTED TO
BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE A REQUIREMENT IT FELT LIKE FANCY DRESS FOR THE BOYS MEANT SOMETHING FUN MEANT DRESSING UP IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS BUT EVERY TIME FOR THE GIRLS THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR VERY NARROW REQUIREMENT OF HOW THEY WERE EXPECTED TO DRESS IT STARTED TO FEEL LIKE IT WAS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST A BIT OF FUN AND MORE LIKE A KIND OF SEXUAL PRESSURE
I GREW UP IN A HOUSE WHERE ART WASN'T A BIG THING WE WEREN'T REALLY COVERING OR LISTENING TO THE
SUDDENLY I'D GOT INTO THIS VERY EXCITING ROCK AND ROLL LIFE I
REMEMBER MY AUNTY MARGARET VERY STERN SCOTTISH WOMAN
SITTING THERE ONE CHRISTMAS DAY
AND SHE SAID GILES I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SERIOUS WITH YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY AND HERE YOU ARE DOING THIS SILLY MUSIC AND FASHION
WHAT WENT WRONG
WHEN I TURNED UP THERE I ACTUALLY BURST INTO TEARS I SAID I'VE FAILED YOU
INTERESTED IN THEIR STORIES IN 2011 WHILE DOING THAT WORK IN AFGHANISTAN I STEPPED ON A LANDMINE I LOST BOTH MY LEGS AND MY ARM
INTO FURTHER DEPRESSION AND REALLY HAD NO IDEA WHERE I WAS GOING WITH MY LIFE I WAS ONLY 29 YEARS OLD BUT I FELT LIKE MY LIFE WAS REALLY OVER AND
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT SMALL GIFT
AND I REMEMBERED THAT OLYMPUS OM 10 CAMERA
AND THE WORK OF DON MCCULLIN
AND I REALIZED
THAT'S WHERE I HAD BEEN GOING WRONG AND THAT I HADN'T FOLLOWED WHAT WAS MY DESTINY
ON THE LAST DAY I WAS THERE I GOT A PHONE CALL
I'D TRACKED DOWN MANY PEOPLE THAT I GOT TO KNOW IN LEBANON BUT NOT EVERYBODY
AND ON THAT PHONE CALL WAS A FAMILY MEMBER OF KHULOOD
THEY SAID KHULOOD WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU SHE HEARS YOU'RE AROUND
I SAID WHERE IS SHE WHERE'S SHE LIVING
THEY SAID SHE'S IN THE SAME TENT WHERE YOU LAST SAW HER
I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE I WANTED TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF DON MCCULLIN AND DOCUMENT CONFLICTS AROUND THE WORLD
SO WITH THIS OLYMPUS OM 10 CAMERA I ACTUALLY TAUGHT MYSELF PHOTOGRAPHY LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED
I USED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE DOCTORS NURSES MY FRIENDS ANYONE WHO WOULD COME IN
AS AN 18 YEAR OLD I MAINLY PHOTOGRAPHED THE NURSES
I WAS TOLD AT FIRST MY LIFE WOULD PROBABLY BE OVER
THEN I WAS TOLD I'D NEVER WALK AGAIN AND I WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER WORK AGAIN
A FEW WEEKS AFTER I GOT INJURED I WATCHED ON THE NEWS AS THE FIRST UPRISINGS BEGAN IN SYRIA
AS THE MONTHS WENT ON I HAD 37 OPERATIONS IN MY FIRST YEAR AND THROUGH THAT RECOVERY AGAIN I WATCHED THE NEWS AND I SAW THE CRISIS IN SYRIA GROW
AS I STARTED MY REHABILITATION AS I WAS WORKING TO WALK AGAIN THE ONLY THING ON MY MIND WAS I HAD TO GO THERE AND COVER THIS STORY BECAUSE I KNEW THIS WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY OF MY CAREER
AND THE STORIES HAD TO BE TOLD
THREE YEARS AFTER MY INJURY I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO RETURN TO WORK FULL TIME AND THE FIRST PLACE I REALLY WANTED TO GO WAS TO LEBANON TO DOCUMENT THE REFUGEE CRISIS THERE
A VICTIM
AND ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS IN MY WORK IS I NEVER WANT TO PORTRAY PEOPLE AS VICTIMS THEY'RE VICTIMS OF CIRCUMSTANCE BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM TO BE SEEN AS VICTIMS
SO I SAID TO THE PEOPLE I WAS WITH I CAN'T TAKE THIS PHOTOGRAPH IT'S WRONG AND WON'T REPRESENT HER IN THE RIGHT WAY
AS SOON AS I SAID THAT HER FAMILY STARTED TO COME BACK IN PEOPLE STARTED TO CHAT
AND HER MOTHER SHIHAN SAID TO ME YOU SHOULD MEET HER SISTER IMAN IMAN AND AYA ARE THE TWO THAT SHOULD BE PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER
THE REFUGEE CRISIS AFFECTS ALL OF US IT'S A GLOBAL CRISIS THAT NEEDS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS I BELIEVE WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS IN HOW WE CHOOSE TO TREAT AND DEAL WITH THE REFUGEE CRISIS I ALSO THINK IT'S A MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR HUMANITY IN HOW WE DEAL WITH IT
AND IT'S DIFFICULT
I COME HOME FROM TRIPS AND PEOPLE SAY HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THESE CAMPS I SAY THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE IS THAT IN THOSE CAMPS I SEE HUMANITY I SEE LOVE I SEE COMPASSION OFTEN WHEN I COME HOME
THAT'S WHERE I MISS IT
EVERY DAY WE SEE IN THE MEDIA NEGATIVE STORIES
EVERY DAY
POLITICIANS USE NEGATIVE RHETORIC FOR THEIR OWN AIMS
NO LONGER LIVED WITH HER BECAUSE SHE FELT ASHAMED AND SHE DIDN'T WANT THEM LIVING THERE WHEN SHE FELT SHE COULDN'T BE A MOTHER
25 OF THE POPULATION
TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT LAST YEAR DURING THE EUROPEAN REFUGEE CRISIS CLOSE TO MILLION REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ARRIVED IN EUROPE
EUROPE HAS A POPULATION OF 250 MILLION PEOPLE
SO IMAGINE WHAT THE PRESSURE IS IN LEBANON
I WAS MOSTLY INTERESTED IN THE MOST VULNERABLE THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THE ELDERLY
SINGLE MOTHERS
SO I
YEAR
I WAS ASKED BY THE UNHCR TO DOCUMENT THE REFUGEE CRISIS ACROSS EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST
THEY GAVE ME ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING BRIEFS A PHOTOGRAPHER'S EVER BEEN GIVEN
THEY JUST SAID FOLLOW YOUR HEART FOR
THE FIRST SIX MONTHS I DOCUMENTED THE CRISIS ACROSS EUROPE
THERE WAS A NAGGING SENSE THAT I SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING MORE WITH MY LIFE
AND THAT NAGGING SENSE GREW TO BECOME A DEPRESSION
AND I FOUND MYSELF REALLY UNHAPPY WITH THE WORK I WAS DOING WITH MY LIFE BUT I COULDN'T QUITE WORK OUT WHAT WAS GOING WRONG ON THE OUTSIDE TO EVERYBODY IT SEEMED LIKE I HAD THIS DREAM LIFE BUT INSIDE I WAS EMPTY
SCHOOL TO DO SURGERY AND I WAS IN THE TOP 1 OF MY CLASS
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU MR DULEY
A PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU TOOK IN AFGHANISTAN INSPIRED ME
AND EVERY DAY I HAD THAT PHOTOGRAPH ON MY WALL
AND WHEN I STRUGGLED I'D LOOK AT THAT IT AND SAY THAT'S WHY I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THAT CAMERA WAS GIVEN TO ME
THE RIPPLES OF THAT ACTION WERE STILL BEING FELT AND AFFECTING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
I'M A STORYTELLER
BUT STORIES HAVE NO POWER IF PEOPLE DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR LISTENING TO THESE STORIES TODAY
TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE THOSE STORIES CONCRETE
BUT IT'S NOW TIME TO TAKE ACTION FROM THAT STRONG BASE THAT WE HAVE BUILT BECAUSE WE MUST TAKE ACTION
AND NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE ALL TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THANK YOU
SAID GILES SERIOUSLY I SAID I'M 19 YEARS OLD THIS IS A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR A CAREER PATH
AFTER SHE WAS INJURED WITH HER LIVING IN THIS TENT PARALYZED HOW WILL SHE TAKE IT BUT I SAID TO THEM I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE PHOTOGRAPH I FIRST TOOK
AND A BOOK BY THE WAR PHOTOGRAPHER DON MCCULLIN
WHEN WAS 18 YEARS OLD I HAD GONE TO THE STATES ON A SPORTS SCHOLARSHIP
I WAS THE WORLD'S WORST BOXER
I REMEMBER GETTING A BACKHANDED COMPLIMENT FROM MY COACH
HE SAID GILES YOU TAKE A PUNCH VERY WELL
BUT AS YOU'LL LEARN I'M QUITE A STUBBORN CHARACTER AND I WASN'T
SURE THAT MY LACK OF SPORTING ABILITY WOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF A SPORTING CAREER
BUT WHEN I REACHED THE STATES I HAD A CAR ACCIDENT AND I DAMAGED MY KNEES AND HAD TO RETURN TO THE UK AND
SUDDENLY I FOUND MYSELF IN HOSPITAL TOLD I WOULD NEVER DO ANY KIND OF SPORT AGAIN
I HAD FAILED AT SCHOOL I'D BEEN QUITE A PROBLEMATIC CHILD
AND LYING IN THAT HOSPITAL BED I BECAME A VERY ANGRY
YOUNG MAN I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MY FUTURE
TO THIS DAY IF I SHUT MY EYES I CAN STILL SEE THOSE IMAGES I WAS SO MOVED THAT I
WHAT IS HER EDUCATION LIKE HOW'S SCHOOL I FOUND OUT THAT SARA HADN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL FOR FOUR YEARS IN FACT SHE HADN'T EVEN PLAYED WITH ANY OTHER CHILDREN IN THAT
SHE HAD CARRIED HER SISTER AYA THAT WHOLE JOURNEY THEN I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT AYA WAS NOT A VICTIM SHE WAS ACTUALLY THE FEISTIEST 4 YEAR OLD HAD EVER MET IN MY LIFE WHEN IMAN WALKED IN SHE SHOUTED HEY DONKEY PICK ME UP {LG}
FOR US WHO KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT TO STAND UP BE COUNTED AND DO SOMETHING
GOT TO KNOW THERE THE FIRST TIME THIS IS MEETING
OF UNDRESS ANOTHER THING THAT I'D GROWN INCREASINGLY CYNICAL ABOUT WAS THE WAY WOMEN WERE PORTRAYED IN THE MAGAZINES I WORKED FOR I WAS LISTENING TO THIS ARGUMENT AND I SUDDENLY THOUGHT THIS IS NOT WHY I BECAME A PHOTOGRAPHER SO IN A
CONFRONTED BY THESE BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES THAT DON MCCULLIN HAD TAKEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
IMAGES FROM BIAFRA FROM THE FAMINES IN BANGLADESH FROM THE WAR IN VIETNAM
AND I WAS AMAZED I WAS SO MOVED BY THESE STORIES
AT NIGHT I WOULD
OUR GIRLS CAN BREAK BARRIERS IN POETRY SCIENCE NATURE ART
BUT NOW YOU KNOW IT SO YOU AND I TOGETHER MUST TAKE WHAT WE NOW KNOW AND LEAN INTO GENDER
I KNOW THAT I MATTER AND I KNOW WHAT MATTERS TO ME AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU TONIGHT
YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO TOGGLE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO THREE OR FOUR OF THESE AT ANY TIME WE WANT IT IS PERFECTLY AMERICAN PERFECTLY FEMINIST AND I LOVE IT
THEY CAN STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN THEY CAN VOLUNTEER IN
FIVE MINUTES IS TAKE YOU THROUGH PROCESS WHERE WE TRIED TO CREATE A REASONABLY PHOTO REALISTIC COMPUTER GENERATED FACE USING SOME COMPUTER GRAPHICS TECHNOLOGY WE'VE DEVELOPED AND ALSO SOME COLLABORATORS AT COMPANY CALLED IMAGE
GIVE TO THE COMPANY IMAGE METRICS TO CREATE A RIGGED DIGITAL VERSION OF
IMPORTANTLY SINCE THIS IS A PHOTOMETRIC PROCESS THAT ONLY TAKES THREE SECONDS TO CAPTURE WE CAN SHOOT EMILY
IS A MARKERLESS PERFORMANCE DRIVEN ANIMATION COMPANY
WE SPECIALIZE IN HIGH QUALITY FACIAL ANIMATION FOR VIDEO GAMES AND FILMS IMAGE METRICS IS A MARKERLESS PERFORMANCE DRIVEN ANIMATION COMPANY
WE SPECIALIZE IN HIGH QUALITY FACIAL ANIMATION FOR VIDEO GAMES AND FILMS PAUL DEBEVEC
PROCESS WAS THEN TO ANIMATE HER WE ACTUALLY USED ONE OF HER OWN PERFORMANCES TO PROVIDE THE SOURCE DATA
BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS HAS BEEN BEING ABLE TO CREATE A PHOTO REAL DIGITAL HUMAN FACE AND ONE OF THE REASONS IT IS SO DIFFICULT IS THAT UNLIKE
ALIENS AND DINOSAURS WE LOOK AT HUMAN FACES EVERY DAY THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AS RESULT WE'RE TUNED IN TO THE SUBTLEST THINGS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRONG WITH A COMPUTER RENDERING IN ORDER TO BELIEVE WHETHER THESE THINGS ARE REALISTIC AND WHAT I'M
LIGHT FROM THE LIGHT STAGE TO FIGURE OUT BOTH THE COARSE SCALE AND THE FINE SCALE DETAIL
NOW WHERE WE GOING WITH THIS HERE WE'VE GONE A LITTLE BIT BEYOND LIGHT STAGE
US TO PHOTOGRAPH HER IN A SERIES OF VERY CONTROLLED ILLUMINATION CONDITIONS AND THE LIGHTING THAT WE
ONES
OKAY AND I SAY THIS HAVING A LOT OF ENGLISH FRIENDS WHO GO TO MY COUNTRY AND THEY COME BACK AND THEY SAY THINGS LIKE OH I REALLY ENJOYED MY VISIT IN AMERICA BUT I'M SO GLAD
TO BE BACK
IN THE LAND OF PLEASE AND
COMMON BUT IF THE LEVEL IS SO BASIC THAT YOU DON'T EVEN REALISE YOU HAVE THEM YOU'RE VERY LIKELY NOT TO REALISE THAT THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THEM
THEY MIGHT BE A BIT EXAGGERATED WE LIKE TO SAY LOVE' AND THINGS LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS GOING TO GIVE MORE OF A SENSE
OF FORMALITY IT'S ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH MORE INDIRECT COMMUNICATION
SO
YOU'VE GOT THOSE TWO THINGS GOING ON ONE THING TO SAY ABOUT DEFERENCE POLITENESS SYSTEMS IS THEY ARE MORE STABLE
BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON THESE SOCIAL HIERARCHIES THAT HAVE COME UP OVER CENTURIES WHEREAS SOLIDARITY POLITENESS SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN FOUND IN NEW CULTURES
ENDS UP GIVING YOU A SENSE OF BELONGING AND EQUALITY IN INTERACTIONS SO EVERYBODY IS ON THE SAME LEVEL
THERE'S TRYING TO CREATE THIS SENSE OF COMRADERY IN INTERACTIONS AND THIS RESULTS IN
INTERACTIONS FEELING LIKE THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF FAMILIARITY IN THEM INFORMALITY
THE OTHER THING THAT WE COULD HAVE IS A DEFERENCE POLITENESS SYSTEM WHICH PUTS MORE
IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T MESS AROUND WITH IT SO WE DON'T GO AROUND SAYING THINGS LIKE YOUR EYES ARE LIKE THE STARS THAT GOD MADE' OR ANYTHING LIKE
ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH SOMEBODY WHO COMES FROM A DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAN YOU WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL BELIEFS ABOUT HOW THESE THINGS WORK YOU'RE LIKELY TO HAVE MISCOMMUNICATION BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS
CHILD FOR SOLIDARITY CULTURES WAY ON THE
ABOUT IT OKAY SO A LITTLE BIT OF THIS A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SO THE QUESTION IS WHO'S POLITE WHO'S SINCERE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER WHO'S FRIENDLY OKAY I'M GOING TO LOOK AT TWO KINDS OF BEHAVIOURS HERE TO ILLUSTRATE THIS COMPLIMENTING AND
THAT WE CAN HAVE A SENSE OF BELONGING ABOUT THAT WE CAN HAVE A SENSE OF VALUING EACH OTHER ABOUT THAT WE CAN PROGRESS IN OUR COMMUNICATION FROM THERE SO I'VE ESTABLISHED SOME GOODWILL IN OUR
CONVERSATION
THE OTHER THING MY ENGLISH
FRIENDS SAY TO ME IS
WE'RE SO BAD AT ACCEPTING COMPLIMENTS
WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY TRUE ENGLISH PEOPLE ACCEPT COMPLIMENTS MORE OFTEN THAN AMERICAN PEOPLE DO ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY BY BOB HERBERT
SO AND BY ACCEPT I MEAN SAYING THANK YOU' OR
A FIERCE SENSE OF INDIVIDUALISM SO YOUR IDENTITY IS BASED ON YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL IT'S I'M NOT WHO I AM
BEING WHO I AM ISN'T BEING PAUL'S DAUGHTER
IT'S BEING ME
SO WE HAVE THIS INDIVIDUALISM
THIS NEED FOR POSITIVE FACE EXCHANGES IN INTERACTIONS WHICH GIVE US VERY LOOSE SOCIAL NETWORKS WE'RE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH POSITIVE FACE FROM AS MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AS WE
YOU GET ALL OF THIS ALL THE TIME IN AMERICAN COMPLIMENTS WELL WHY DO AMERICANS GIVE A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE EASIEST WAY TO GIVE PEOPLE POSITIVE FACE TO SAY I VALUE SOMETHING ABOUT YOU SO IN A
DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WE ALL HAVE BOTH OF THESE DESIRES SORT OF
YOU KNOW FIGHTING IT OUT WHEN WE INTERACT WITH SOMEBODY OH SHOULD I ASK THEM I WANT THIS THING FROM THEM BUT WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH OF AN IMPOSITION ON THEIR NEGATIVE FACE
ETC
SO WE'RE ALWAYS
JUDGING THESE THINGS WHEN WE INTERACT AND ANYTIME WE INTERACT IT IS A FACE THREATENING EVENT RIGHT
I SAY EXCUSE ME CAN YOU TELL ME THE TIME I'VE TAKEN YOUR FREEDOM AWAY FROM YOU JUST BY ENGAGING YOU IN A CONVERSATION IT'S THREATENED YOUR NEGATIVE FACE
I TELL YOU I DISAGREE WITH YOU I'VE THREATENED YOUR POSITIVE FACE
SO
REASON WHY THIS IS POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THANK YOU' NO LONGER MEANS THANK YOU IN BRITISH
NOTIONS IT TAKES FROM THERE IS THE NOTION OF FACE' WHICH IS A NOTION YOU'LL KNOW FROM EXPRESSIONS LIKE
I LOST FACE IN AN INTERACTION' I SAVED SOME FACE THAT SORT OF THING
WELL IN POLITENESS THEORY THE ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A BIG ONE BY BROWN AND LEVINSON
THE
NOTION OF FACE IS MADE MORE COMPLEX
WE EACH HAVE TWO ASPECTS TO OUR FACE WE'RE SORT OF JANUS LIKE CREATURES
WHO HAVE BOTH A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE FACE THESE ARE JUST LABELS IT DOESN'T MEAN THE GOOD FACE AND THE BAD FACE
BUT WE'VE GOT THESE TWO COMPETING FORCES
IN WHAT WE WANT OUT OF INTERACTIONS
YOUR POSITIVE FACE IS YOUR DESIRE TO BE APPRECIATED TO BE VALUED TO FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG
SO TO FEEL THAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE YOU
YOUR NEGATIVE
THE REASON WHY ENGLISH FRIENDS WILL FIND THIS INSINCERE
IS BECAUSE THEY THINK
HOW CAN THEY LIKE ME HOW CAN ALL THIS LIKING BE GOING ON ALL THE TIME HOW CAN THEY BE SO POSITIVE ALL THE TIME
AND THE REASON WE CAN DO THAT IS BECAUSE WE COMPARTMENTALISE PEOPLE IF I TELL YOU I LIKE YOUR SHOES
OR EVEN IF I LIKE YOUR IDEA IT DOESN'T MEAN I LIKE
AS SOMEBODY WHO IS A STUDENT AND A RESEARCHER INTERESTED IN WELL AS A STUDENT OF LIFE
IN THAT SENSE INTERESTED IN HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE
WOW THERE'S A LOT TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU'RE A FOREIGNER IN CULTURE AND THERE'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT
SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT POLITENESS TODAY AND HOW THE BRITISH AND AMERICANS INTERACT AND ABOUT THE CONCEPTS WE HAVE ABOUT OURSELVES AS WHO ARE THE POLITE ONES AND WHO
THANKING OF COURSE I SAID
THAT'S WHAT BRITISH PEOPLE OFTEN MISS WHEN THEY GO TO AMERICA PLEASE' AND THANK YOU
AND I WAS AT THE BANK THE OTHER DAY TRYING TO CHANGE MY ADDRESS
I LOST INTEREST IN COUNTING AT THE TWELFTH THANK YOU'
THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE GUY AND ME WE WERE ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE INTERACTION
THANK YOU THANK YOU
INTERACTION THE UK NOT THAT FAR DOWN THE DEFERENCE SCALE BUT A LOT MORE DEFERENCE ORIENTED THAN
JUST THE END OF IT BUT A GUY HAS GONE INTO A SHOP THE SHOP IS CLOSING SO THEY WON'T SELL HIM ANYTHING BUT HE ASKED THE PRICE OF THE THING
ACCORDING TO THE POLITENESS SYSTEM THAT YOU'VE LEARNED
AND LOT OF UNSPOKEN HIDDEN BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PERSON WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE AN INTERACTION WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP ALL THESE SORT OF
THINGS THAT ARE HIDDEN THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE KNOW BUT WE ACT ON THE BASIS OF THOSE
HAD ABSOLUTELY NO TIME FOR ME AND THEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR I GOT THE STUDENT EVALUATIONS AND THEY WERE GREAT
THAT'S WHEN IT SUNK IN
I WAS USED TO GETTING CONSTANT FEEDBACK FROM AMERICAN STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKED
AND I WASN'T GETTING THAT IN ANOTHER
CULTURE IT'S
REALLY SORT OF ESSENTIAL TO YOUR OWN SENSE OF SELF TO HAVE THAT POSITIVE FACE FLOW
IN THIS KIND OF
EVERYBODY WAS SO LOVELY BUT AFTER WHILE I JUST GOT SICK OF THE INSINCERITY
HOW CAN THEY REALLY LOVE EVERYTHING THAT MUCH
I GOT SICK OF
THE ENTHUSIASM YOU KNOW BECAUSE AMERICANS ARE THEY MEET YOU AND SAY OH WOW I LOVE YOUR SHOES' OH I LOVE YOUR NAME' OH I LOVE YOUR VOICE'
AMERICANS SAY THANK YOU' LESS BECAUSE TO THEM IT MEANS GRATITUDE
AND YOU FEEL GRATITUDE LESS OFTEN THAN YOU HAVE TO MARK
THESE SEGMENTS IN A CONVERSATION
BRITISH PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THEY'RE IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE THEY MISS THOSE MARKERS
THAT'S WHAT GIVES YOU YOUR COMPASS IN AN INTERACTION HAVING THE MARKERS THAT YOU'RE USED TO HAVING
BUT YOU KNOW IT'S
NOT
THIS AT LEAST IS NOT EVIDENCE THANKING BEHAVIOUR IS NOT EVIDENCE OF GREATER GRATITUDE IN ONE
CULTURE OR ANOTHER
HERE'S AN ACTUAL EXAMPLE OF A BRITISH SHOP
OR AGREEING WITH THE
COMPLIMENT BUT WHY ENGLISH PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ALL THESE COMPLIMENTS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE AN AFFRONT TO PRIVACY
RIGHT IF I TELL YOU I LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT YOU IT MEANS I NOTICED SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
AND THAT CAN FEEL INVASIVE IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE PERSON
KIND OF WELL
IF YOU
DON'T HAVE THIS SORT OF
POSITIVE FACE
OPENNESS BUT AMERICANS AND THE BRITISH DO THIS TOO
BUT WHAT HERBERT FOUND WAS THAT THE AMERICANS DO IT AT GREATER RATES
WILL DO SOMETHING IN RESPONDING TO A COMPLIMENT THAT INVOLVES
NOT ACCEPTING THE COMPLIMENT SO I MIGHT GIVE YOU A COMPLIMENT BACK
I MIGHT
DOWNGRADE WHAT YOU COMPLIMENTED ME ON YEAH YOU MIGHT LIKE THESE SHOES BUT THEY'RE REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE
OR I'LL TELL YOU HOW YOU COULD BE LIKE ME AND HAVE THIS COMPLIMENTABLE THING TOO OH I GOT IT AT
ASDA
YOU CAN AFFORD IT TOO SO
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WE DO WHY
IF IT'S ABOUT HAVING POSITIVE FACE SHOULDN'T I WANT POSITIVE THINGS SAID ABOUT MYSELF WELL YES I DO
HERE'S WHERE I GET INSINCERE I DO WANT YOU SAYING POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT ME
BUT ONCE YOU'VE SAID SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT ME YOU'VE PUT ME ON A PEDESTAL
AND OUR INTERACTION HAS TO BE ABOUT EQUALITY WE ALL KNOW WE'RE NOT EQUAL BUT WE HAVE TO ACT
LIKE WE'RE EQUAL SO ONCE YOU'VE PUT ME UP ON A PEDESTAL I HAVE TO TAKE MYSELF BACK DOWN TO THE LEVEL I WAS AT OR BRING YOU UP ON THE PEDESTAL WITH ME
TO KEEP
CULTURE YOU NEED TO DO THAT A LOT IF IT'S MISSING YOU NOTICE IT BUT YOU DON'T REALISE YOU'RE NOTICING IT SO WHEN I MOVED AWAY FROM THE U S AT FIRST I WAS TEACHING IN SOUTH AFRICA AND I FELT LIKE EVERYBODY HATED ME AND I WAS CONVINCED
OF THIS COMPLICATION OF THE NOTION OF FACE ALLOWS DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLITENESS
IS ALWAYS EXPLAINING ENGLISH BEHAVIOURS TO ME IN TERMS OF OH IT'S THE BRITISH INNATE POLITENESS
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THESE THINGS
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SKYSCANNER' AN INTERNET TRAVEL AGENT RECENTLY DID A SURVEY
ASKING BRITISH TRAVELLERS
WHAT ARE THE RUDEST COUNTRIES TO VISIT WHO'S MOST UNFRIENDLY TO YOU
OKAY WHO DID THE BRITISH
VOTE UNFRIENDLY
THE FRENCH
THE RUSSIANS
AND NUMBER THREE THE BRITISH OKAY SO YOU'VE GOT THIS NOTION OF BRITAIN
BEING A VERY POLITE CULTURE AT THE SAME TIME BEING A VERY RUDE CULTURE
HAPPENING HERE IS THEY'RE JUST SORT OF ESTABLISHING THAT NOBODY'S GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY
THIS IS WHY I MEAN THIS HAPPENS
IN PROBABLY ALL CULTURES YOU DON'T JUST WALK AWAY FROM A CONVERSATION RIGHT THAT'S A POSITIVE FACE THREAT TO SOMEBODY THAT'S SAYING I'M REJECTING YOU SO YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND FORTH A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE SURE OKAY NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO GO ON HERE AND THE BRITISH DO THIS IN THESE KINDS OF INTERACTIONS WITH THANK YOU
YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE OKAY' THERE
FOR THE LAST FOUR
IN AN AMERICAN INTERACTION RIGHT SO THAT'S INDICATING THERE IS NO GRATITUDE MEANING THERE THERE'S JUST ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
MEANING
AND I GAVE SOME EXAMPLES AND THEN SHE ASKED ME WHAT ABOUT HORIZONTAL FOLK DANCING
{NS} AND ALTOGETHER I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT THEY SAID THAT JUST THE WEBSITES ALONE THAT FEATURED OUR ARTICLE HAD
30 MINUTES PER WEEK WHICH ISN'T MUCH THANK YOU {NS}
SO YOU MAY THINK SITTING IN SILENCE FOCUSING ON YOUR BREATH FOR FIVE TO TEN MINUTES A DAY
FEEL THE FEET FIRMLY PLANTED ONTO THE GROUND MAYBE FEEL THE SEAT BONES DROPPING IN IF YOU'RE SEATED START TO
AUTOMATICALLY DEEPEN ON THE EXHALE
BEGIN TO BRING YOUR AWARENESS TO YOUR BREATH TO THE DEEP SENSATIONS OF THE BREATH NOTICE THE RISE OF YOUR CHEST AS YOU INHALE NOTICE THE
SETTLE LET THE EYES SOFTLY CLOSE TAKE A MOMENT AS YOU'RE
BEGIN TO BRING IN A SENSE OF PEACE CALMNESS SERENITY ON YOUR INHALE BEGIN TO LET GO TENSION FEAR ANXIETY

THE SKIES AS YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN START TO FEEL THE SHOULDERS SOFTENING DOWN THE BACK
CROWDS ADVERTISEMENTS ANYTHING THAT'S TRYING TO GAIN OUR ATTENTION WHICH BEGINS TO ACTIVATE THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT
ALLOW THE COUNT TO DROP AWAY
EVEN ALLOW THE INTERNAL VISION OF THE BREATH TO DROP AWAY
ALLOW YOUR AWARENESS TO EMPTY COMPLETELY OF ANY IMAGES THOUGHTS
SENSATIONS IMPRESSIONS EXPERIENCES
TAKE A MOMENT HERE TO NOTICE SMOOTHNESS OF THE BREATH
QUIETNESS OF THE MIND EVEN THE STILLNESS OF THE PHYSICAL BODY
STAND UP WHATEVER FEELS RIGHT FOR YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO STRETCH AROUND A LITTLE BIT JUST CHOOSE WHERE YOU WANT TO BE THEN ONCE YOU MAKE THAT DECISION TAKE A COUPLE OF MOMENTS TO EVEN SHIFT A LITTLE BIT GET COMFORTABLE ALLOW THE EYES TO
MORE AWARE OF THIS PRESENT MOMENT
THAT EVERYTHING SEEMS A LITTLE MORE VIVID A LITTLE MORE ALIVE
DO YOU FEEL REFRESHED RECHARGED REJUVENATED
ARE YOU READY TO TAKE ON THE REST OF YOUR DAY
IMAGINE IF
BODY EVEN BEGIN TO LISTEN TO THE BEAT OF YOUR HEART WELCOME YOURSELF AS YOU ARE AT THIS VERY PRESENT MOMENT
RESIST BUT WHAT IF IT WAS A CRUCIAL REGIMENT FOR YOUR HEALTH
WHAT IF BY TAKING THOSE FIVE MINUTES A DAY WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE AND YOUR DAY
SO WHERE DO WE START
LET'S BEGIN HERE RIGHT
FROM ME AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT FEELS LIKE PARTS OF MY LIFE
COMBINED SLOT MACHINES
RIGHT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD GOAL BUT THAT WOULD KIND OF BE LIKE OUR GOAL WITH MESSAGING BEFORE WHERE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DELIVER MESASGE SO WHAT'S THE DEEPER HUMAN GOAL WELL THEY SET THEIR
DO BECAUSE IT LEAVES US WITH THIS ALL OR NOTHING RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY RIGHT YOU'RE EITHER ON
AND I'M A DESIGNER I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THIS WORKS I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON BUT
PLACE TO STAY WITH A FREE COUCH FROM SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING TO OFFER IT SO GREAT SERVICE WHAT WOULD THERE DESIGN GOAL BE WHAT ARE YOU DESIGNING FOR IF YOU WORK AT COUCHSURFING
THAT IN TERMS OF THIS NEW KIND OF DESIGN AND USERS FOR ALL OF US WE CAN DEMAND TECHNOLOGY THAT WORKS THIS WAY NOW IT MAY SEEM HARD BUT MCDONALD'S
HINT WHY THIS IS HAPPENING WHAT DO YOU THINK MAKES MORE MONEY IN THE UNITED STATES
AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED HELP FROM DESIGNERS BECAUSE KNOWING THIS STUFF DOESN'T HELP WE'RE GOING TO NEED DESIGN
WE'RE DOING HERE TOO AND THAT'S THAT WE'RE CHANGING THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE ANSWERING INSTEAD OF THE GOAL OF CHAT BEING
LIVES THAT ARE POSITIVE THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER EXISTED IF YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT TO DO AT WORK TODAY CAN YOU IMAGINE A
SO WE'RE DOING TWO THINGS HERE WE'RE CREATING A NEW CHOICE FOR
FACE CHAT TEXT MESSAGING SO LET'S SAY THERE'S TWO PEOPLE NANCY'S ON THE LEFT AND
WERE ABOUT THE DEEPEST HUMAN VALUES LIKE WHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING FOR THE DEEPEST QUESTIONS AND THE
IS A SLOT MACHINE EVERY TIME I CHECK MY PHONE I'M PLAYING THE SLOT MACHINE TO SEE WHAT AM I GOING TO GET
AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPENT ON THE WEBSITE OR IMAGINE DATING SERVICES LIKE MAYBE TINDER OR
THAT ALL OF US LIVE BY MAYBE LIKE IN MEDICINE WHERE WE HAVE A HIPPOCRATIC OATH TO RECOGNIZE THE RESPONSIBILTY AND THIS
WITH SUCH SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY WE PLAY WITH COINS HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
WOULD AMOUNT TO SHIFTING FROM A WORLD THAT'S DRIVEN AND RUN ENTIRELY ON
DIDN'T HAVE ORGANIC FOOD UNTIL THE CONSUMER DEMAND WAS THERE WE HAVE TO DEMAND THIS NEW KIND OF TECHNOLOGY
WAS IN 2007 THEY INTRODUCED A WAY TO MEASURE THIS WHICH IS INCREDIBLE I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT WORKS EVERY DESIGN GOAL THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CORRESPONDING
DIFFERENT PREMIUM SHELF SPACE ON APP STORES IMAGINE YOU HAD WEB BROWSERS THAT HELPED ROUTE YOU TO THESE KINDS OF DESIGN PRODUCTS CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW EXCITING IT WOULD BE TO
OF MY TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW TO SPEND MY TIME PROBABLY TOO MUCH I PROBABLY OBSESS OVER IT MY FRIENDS THINK I DO BUT I
IMAGINE A PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL NETWORK THAT INSTEAD OF MEASURING ITS SUCCESS IN TERMS OF CONNECTIONS CREATED OR MESSAGES SENT
WHAT IF WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR TECHNOLOGY
AND JOHN ARE IN THIS ALL OR NOTHING RELATIONSHIP NANCY MIGHT WANT TO DISCONNECT BUT THEN SHE'D BE WORRIED WHAT IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING IMPORTANT DESIGN CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM
THAT WORKED THIS WAY THAT WAS HELPING YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WELL NOW TO DO
HAVE THE MORE USAGE YOU HAVE THE MORE TIME PEOPLE SPEND THAT'S HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS
I KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND EVEN KNOWING
THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION HAPPEN IN THE REAL WORLD NOT JUST IN THESE DESIGN MEETINGS WELL THE ANSWER IS YES AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES
GOT TO HELP ORGANIZE A MEETING BETWEEN SOME OF TECHNOLOGY'S LEADING DESIGNERS AND THICH NHAT HAN
NOT DOING SO WELL TO START WITH BUT LET'S START THAT CONVERSATION DESIGNERS YOU CAN REDEFINE
MEASURED THE DEEP ROMANTIC FULFILLING CONNECTIONS PEOPLE CREATED WHATEVER THAT WAS FOR THEM BY THE WAY
IN TERMS OF COOKING NIGHTS ORGANIZED AND THE COOKING ARTICLES THAT YOU WERE
PLAYING THE SLOT MACHINE SAYING WHAT AM I GOING TO GET EVERY TIME I SCROLL A NEWS FEED I'M PLAYING THE SLOT MACHINE TO SEE WHAT AM I GOING TO
BUT CLICK ON IT RIGHT NOW RIGHT BECAUSE LIKE WHAT IF IT'S
SO WE CAN'T COMPARE IT JUST BASED ON PRICE THIS IS A DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF
BUT RATHER THAN TALK ABOUT IT I WANTED US TO EXPERIENCE
THE MEDITATION INSTRUCTION IS VERY SIMPLE
IT'S SIMPLY A WAY
TO CONNECT WITH YOU WITH WHO YOU ARE
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS BUILDING A BRIDGE BETWEEN
OUR INDIVIDUAL SELVES
AND
LET'S JUST CALL IT THE UNIVERSAL SELF
UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS
SO THE INSTRUCTION IS VERY SIMPLE ALL YOU DO IS SIT COMFORTABLY AND THEY INVITE YOU TO
CLOSE YOUR EYES SO YOU CAN
HEIGHTEN YOUR SENSE OF HEARING
AND I'LL BE PLAYING THESE OVERTONE RICH SOUNDS FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES
AND DURING THESE FEW MINUTES ALL YOU DO IS LISTEN
AND LISTENING NOT ONLY TO THE SOUNDS BUT LISTENING TO THE SENSATIONS IN YOUR
IT
IF WE TAKE THE TIME
JUST TO LISTEN
MUSIC AND SOUND
NEVER STOP TO TEACH ME MORE ABOUT LIFE
A FEW YEARS AGO WHILE PLAYING THE DIDGERIDOO AT ROSWELL PARK A CANCER INSTITUTE FOR A PATIENT
HE WENT SO DEEPLY INTO HIS STATE OF LISTENING
THAT
{LG} NOW EXTEND YOUR SIGH INTO A NOTE
COULD HAPPEN AND WE SPENT MANY OTHER VISITS
SPONTANEOUS MUSIC MAKING TOGETHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS STUART FUCHS
TO POSTURE TO BREATH AND ALSO TO A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BODIES THE CORNERS OF OUR MOUTH AND BY ACTIVATING IT JUST A LITTLE BIT WE CAN BEGIN TO
OF MUSIC AS HEALING BRIDGE BETWEEN PEOPLE BETWEEN ALL BEINGS
LIFE WHAT I WAS HOPING TO SHARE TODAY WAS
COME IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE RAPTURE OF MUSIC TEND TO EACH
{NS} AND THIS SUTRA THIS THREAD THIS WEAVE OF WORDS WHILE POETIC IT WAS
YOU GET A TAPE RECORDER YOU PUT IT BESIDE YOUR BED AND IT TURNS ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LEARNING FROM THIS
A GOOD IDEA UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T WORK
BUT HYPNOPAEDIA DID OPEN THE DOORS TO RESEARCH IN OTHER AREAS AND WE'VE HAD INCREDIBLE DISCOVERIES ABOUT LEARNING THAT BEGAN WITH THAT FIRST QUESTION
NOW THIS IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION IN TODAY'S WORLD WE HAVE MASSIVE CHALLENGES WITH ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE MASSIVE CHALLENGES WITH SOCIAL DISLOCATION WITH WARS ALL SORTS OF THINGS GOING ON AND
IF WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK EACH OTHER'S LANGUAGES THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
THE
BUT WHAT WAS REALLY COOL WAS TWO WEEKS LATER WHEN PEOPLE WERE TALKING CHINESE AROUND ME I WAS UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THIS AND I HADN'T EVEN MADE ANY EFFORT TO LEARN THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED I'D ABSORBED IT THAT NIGHT ON THE
THE MATERIAL USING PRINCIPLES THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OBSERVING NATURE BIRDS IN THIS
100 YEARS AGO EVERYBODY BELIEVED THAT HEAVY STUFF DOESN'T FLY
AND ON MY SECOND WEEK I GOT TO TAKE A TRAIN RIDE OVERNIGHT I SPENT EIGHT HOURS SITTING IN THE DINING CAR TALKING TO ONE OF THE GUARDS ON THE TRAIN HE TOOK AN
NOUNS SIMPLE VERBS SIMPLE ADJECTIVES COMMUNICATING LIKE A BABY AND BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES STRUGGLING TERRIBLY WITH CHINESE I SAW CHINESE PEOPLE STRUGGLING TERRIBLY TO LEARN ENGLISH AND OTHER LANGUAGES AND SO MY QUESTION
CAN BUY ONE OF THESE FOR A COUPLE 100 000 US DOLLARS WE NOW HAVE CARS IN THE WORLD THAT FLY AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO FLY WHICH WE'VE LEARNED FROM SQUIRRELS
DEAL AND FINALLY PEOPLE WERE SAYING YOU'RE COMPLETELY USELESS YOU'RE NOT TALENTED GIVE UP YOU'RE WASTE OF TIME AND SHE WAS VERY VERY DEPRESSED AND THEN SHE CAME ACROSS THESE FIVE PRINCIPLES SHE MOVED TO BRAZIL AND SHE APPLIED THEM AND IN SIX MONTHS SHE WAS FLUENT IN PORTUGUESE SO TALENT DOESN'T MATTER
SO COMPREHENSION WORKS COMPREHENSION IS KEY AND LANGUAGE LEARNING IS NOT
BE A FEW MORE BUT THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY CORE AND BEFORE I GET INTO THOSE I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT TWO MYTHS I WANT TO DISPEL TWO MYTHS
NOW MOST PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE I WOULDN'T SAY EVERYBODY BUT LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN'T DRAW HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME KEY PRINCIPLES FIVE PRINCIPLES THAT YOU CAN APPLY TO LEARNING TO DRAW AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEARN TO DRAW IN FIVE DAYS SO
BABY AND IF YOU DROP YOURSELF INTO A CONTEXT WHICH IS ALL ADULTS TALKING ABOUT STUFF OVER YOUR HEAD YOU WON'T LEARN
LANGUAGE LEARNING FOR ABOUT 15 TO 20 YEARS NOW
THOSE IN A WAY THAT YOU MAKE SOUNDS THAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND IF YOU'VE EVER DONE A NEW SPORT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND YOU KNOW HOW YOUR BODY FEELS
REPEAT THAT PLEASE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ALL IN YOUR TARGET LANGUAGE YOU'RE USING IT AS A TOOL MAKING IT USEFUL TO YOU IT'S RELEVANT TO
IS HOW DO YOU DO THAT WELL IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY EASY
INSIDE YOUR MIND IT'S FEELINGS IF YOU TALK ABOUT FIRE YOU CAN SMELL THE SMOKE YOU CAN HEAR THE CRACKLING YOU CAN
JUST OBSERVE HOW THEY USE THEIR FACE LET YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND ABSORB THE RULES THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PICK IT UP AND IF YOU CAN'T GET A NATIVE SPEAKER TO LOOK AT YOU CAN USE STUFF LIKE THIS
AND THIS IS REALLY REALLY WELL DOCUMENTED NOW IT'S SOMETHING CALLED COMPREHENSIBLE INPUT THERE'S 20 OR 30 YEARS OF RESEARCH ON THIS
STEPHEN KRASHEN LEADER IN THE FIELD HAS PUBLISHED ALL SORTS OF THESE DIFFERENT STUDIES AND THIS IS JUST FROM ONE OF THEM THE PURPLE BARS SHOW THE SCORES ON DIFFERENT
WHAT DO BABIES DO OK ME BATH NOW OK THAT'S HOW THEY
THAT IT BECOMES PART OF HOW YOU THINK
MAYBE EVEN PART OF WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON
WELL I'VE HAD A QUESTION IN MY MIND FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND THAT IS
HOW
CAN YOU SPEED UP LEARNING
NOW
THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE IF YOU SPEED UP LEARNING YOU CAN SPEND LESS TIME AT SCHOOL
AND IF YOU LEARN REALLY FAST
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AT ALL
NOW WHEN I WAS YOUNG
SCHOOL WAS SORT OF OK BUT
I FOUND QUITE OFTEN THAT SCHOOL GOT IN THE WAY OF LEARNING
SO I HAD THIS QUESTION IN MIND HOW DO YOU LEARN FASTER
AND IF YOU CAN'T HEAR IT YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND IT IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEARN IT SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THESE SOUNDS AND THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THAT BUT IT'S PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAINING
BECAUSE VIETNAMESE IS ABOUT 30 PERCENT MANDARIN 30 PERCENT CANTONESE
THAT'S HOW I LOOK LIKE WHEN I'M CONCENTRATING SO INTENSELY THAT MY BRAIN IS EXPLODING
OF THAT MEMORY AND YOU COME OUT WITH ANOTHER PATHWAY SO I CALL IT SAME BOX DIFFERENT PATH YOU COME OUT OF THAT
IMPROVE AND REMEMBER THESE ARE THINGS UNDER YOUR CONTROL AS THE LEARNER DO THEM ALL AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE FLUENT IN A SECOND LANGUAGE IN SIX MONTHS
YOU WILL GO NUTS BECAUSE YOU'LL BE INCREDIBLY UPSET ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PERFECT IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH GETTING SOME NOT GETTING SOME JUST PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU DO
IN A CONTEXT WHERE YOU'RE HEARING TONS AND TONS AND TONS OF A LANGUAGE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT OR NOT YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE RHYTHMS TO PATTERNS THAT REPEAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO
NOW YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT
IN 1981
EVERYBODY THOUGHT CHINESE WAS REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND THAT A WESTERNER COULD STUDY FOR 10 YEARS OR MORE AND NEVER REALLY GET VERY GOOD AT IT
AND I ALSO WENT IN WITH A DIFFERENT IDEA WHICH WAS
TAKING ALL OF THE CONCLUSIONS FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH UP TO THAT POINT AND APPLYING THEM TO THE LEARNING PROCESS
NIGHT TWO HOURS EACH TIME PRACTICING AT HOME SHE SPENT NINE MONTHS AND SHE DID NOT LEARN TO TYPE CHINESE
AND ONE NIGHT WE HAD A CRISIS
WE HAD 48 HOURS TO DELIVER A TRAINING MANUAL IN CHINESE
AND SHE GOT THE JOB AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IN 48 HOURS SHE LEARNED TO TYPE CHINESE BECAUSE IT WAS RELEVANT IT WAS MEANINGFUL IT WAS IMPORTANT SHE WAS USING A TOOL
CANADA HAVE BEEN THERE 10 20 YEARS AND THEY DON'T SPEAK ANY ENGLISH IMMERSION PER SE DOES NOT WORK
GOT 3000 WORDS YOU'RE SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE THE REST IS ICING ON THE CAKE AND WHEN YOU'RE
RELAXED IN AN ALPHA BRAIN STATE CURIOUS YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN REALLY QUICKLY
SHE GOT A GRADES ALL THE WAY THROUGH WENT THROUGH COLLEGE A GRADES WENT TO THE US AND FOUND SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING AND PEOPLE STARTED ASKING HER ARE YOU
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LEARNING COME WITH ME ON A JOURNEY THROUGH A FOREST YOU GO ON A WALK THROUGH FOREST AND YOU SEE SOMETHING
NOW WHEN I SAY THIS MOST PEOPLE THINK
I WENT ON FROM THERE TO BECOME PASSIONATE ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY AND
BODY LANGUAGE FROM BODY LANGUAGE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND LOT OF COMMUNICATION THEREFORE YOU'RE UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE ACQUIRING THROUGH COMPREHENSIBLE INPUT
THE ARAB SPRING IS STILL SPREADING THE EUROZONE HAS COLLAPSED WHAT ELSE THE OCCUPY MOVEMENT FOUND A VOICE AND I STILL HAVE TO SPEAK ENGLISH CONSTANTLY SO THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CHANGE
THERE TONS OF SCHOOL PROJECTS TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POSTERS WE ARE RECEIVING COMES FROM SCHOOLS EDUCATION IS SO ESSENTIAL
EACH TIME I GET WALL IN NEW YORK I USE HIS PHOTOS TO CONTINUE SPREADING THE
TO THE QUESTION CAN ART CHANGE THE WORLD MAYBE NOT IN ONE YEAR
AGO I WAS IN THE STREET WRITING MY NAME TO SAY I EXIST
USED INSIDE OUT AS A PLATFORM FOR PROTEST
AND SEND THEM BACK TO YOU THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PASTE THEM WHERE IT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU TO PLACE YOUR OWN
KNOW BECAUSE IN 2005 I MET THE THEN MAYOR AND HIS
CITY A SMART CITY IS SOMETHING
THEN PUT THAT MONEY INTO OTHER THINGS
IN WATERLOO ONTARIO CANADA
THEY IN FACT DID THAT
IN CAMBRIDGE THEY SAVED 100000 AND PUT IT INTO NEW THINGS
UP THE STREET ANOTHER COMMUNITY IS PART OF THE WATERLOO REGION
THE CITY OF WATERLOO
THERE IS A UNIVERSITY THERE THAT HAS AN INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY POLICY
THAT IF THE STUDENT AND THE PROFESSORS
HAVE
THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT COMES OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY THEY ACTUALLY GET TO KEEP IT THEY OWN IT
THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T DEAL WITH IT
CAPITAL THAT YOU CAN TO IT
AND THEN CREATE WHEN YOU HAVE A SMART PERSON AND YOU HAVE SMART INFRASTRUCTURE NOW YOU CAN DEVELOP INNOVATION CREATIVITY
AND SHARE IT WITH THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH DIGITAL INCLUSION
AND WE HAVE IN RIO A REALLY TERRIFIC EXAMPLE OF DIGITAL INCLUSION
AND THEN YOU
IT A REVOLUTION NO IT'S NOT REVOLUTION WHAT IT IS IS IT'S CREATING
WELL WE'RE NOW AT 126 OF THESE CITIES HUNDREDS 400 HUNDRED A YEAR COME TO OUR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AND TALK TO US ABOUT BECOMING PART OF AN INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY ONLY
ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS IN FACT TO DO A THING
WELL POSITIONED AND THEN CREATE WHAT WE CALL EXCELLENCE IN GOVERNANCE BECAUSE IF YOU DO THEN YOU CREATE A REALLY TERRIFIC
INTENSIFICATION MEANS GOOD LAND USES AND SO FORTH SO THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF
CALLED BRAINPORT AND BRAINPORT HAS ADAPTED IDEAS SUCH AS OPEN INNOVATION
THAT WILL BE ABLE TO GROW UP AS IF TECHNOLOGY WAS SECOND TO NONE AS PART OF THEIR DAILY ACTIVITY THEY'LL CREATE A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE
OF BROADBAND AND HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY
EVERYTHING CONNECTS TO EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CAN'T MAKE A CHANGE TODAY THAT ISN'T GOING TO IMPACT SOMETHING ELSE LATER SO WE AT THE INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY FORUM HAVE FOR YEARS USED THIS CRITERIA TO ESTABLISH WHAT
OF THAT BIG DATA LET'S CALL IT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ANALYZE IT AND COME UP WITH BETTER IDEAS BETTER PROCESSES THAT MAKE THEIR CITIES BETTER IN THE MEANTIME WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THESE CITIES HAVE ALSO
CURRENT INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY OF THE YEAR YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF IT BUT THIS IS A CITY THAT NOT ONLY STARTED OFF AS A SMART
AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT
THIS AFTERNOON
SO WHAT IS SMART CITY WELL CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD THEIR ADMINISTRATIONS THEIR PUBLIC SECTOR BUT ALSO WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITIES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE
BETTER THINGS OUT OF THE ASSETS THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
OBVIOUSLY COSTS HAVE RISEN
CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE COSTING A LOT MORE MONEY THEY'VE GROWN DOUBLED TRIPLED IN SIZE BUT THEY ARE FLAT IN TERMS OF THEIR BUDGETS
SO WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'VE IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES TO
OF THE BLACKBERRY HAS PUT MONEY THROUGH A PROCESS INTO
IT HAS A WEBSITE AND IT TEACHES COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD AND USES YOUR COMMUNITY AS ONE OF THE EXAMPLES AND
BOY IT'S HOT HERE IN PIRA IT'S A VERY HOT PLACE DO YOU
SECTORS AND THEY'RE WORKING WITH GROUPS LIKE THE CITY OF WATERLOO AND WITH TAIPEI THROUGH A TRIANGLE AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT WAYS
AND BE ABLE TO BUILD THE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR PROSPERITY AND WEALTH AND HAPPINESS
AND CAPABILITIES AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PROSPER AS A RESULT YOU
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RIO IN MY SEVERAL VISITS TO RIO I'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN LITTLE BIT THAT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR THIS IS AN IDYLLIC SCENE THAT YOU
MY COLLEAGUES TOOK ME THROUGH THEY WERE ABLE TO SHOW ME THAT RIO WAS PLACE WHERE
THE POOR AND
THE RICH WERE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND
PLAY WITH THE KINDS OF TOOLS OF THE BROADBAND SOCIETY THAT WE ARE TODAY
BY ALL OF US
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BROADBAND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE KINDS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT
ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM
IF IT'S ACCESSIBLE AND IF IT'S AFFORDABLE
EVERYONE CAN PARTICIPATE REMEMBER
THERE IS NO IDEA THAT'S TOO
IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE MONEY FOLLOWS IDEAS AND THERE'S NO
YOUR COMMUNITY TO THE WORLD TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT AND TALENT
SO WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT WELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INTERNET OF THINGS ACTUALLY IT'S THE INTERNET OF EVERYTHING WE ARE ABLE TO
FEEL YOU ARE OR HOW SMALL YOUR IDEA MAY BE IT IS ACTUALLY A BIG IDEA
LIFE OF PI THE MOVIE THAT ANG LEE MADE WAS CREATED IN TAICHUNG NOT IN HOLLYWOOD
BECAUSE THIS CRISIS PULLED THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND THE
SMART PEOPLE AND SMART INFRASTRUCTURE I TOLD YOU YOU'RE ABLE THEN TO CREATE AND INNOVATE AND THAT'S WHERE THE RESOURCES AND THE MONEY FLOW
GOOD IDEAS
WELL WE'RE NOW ALSO TALKING ABOUT DIGITAL INCLUSION BRINGING EVERYBODY TOGETHER WHO HAVE THOSE IDEAS
AND FINALLY WE TALK ABOUT MARKETING AND ADVOCACY
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT BUT ALSO TALENT AND THEN THE OTHER IDEA IS THEY HAVE TO KEEP IT THEY HAVE TO KEEP THAT INVESTMENT AND KEEP THAT TALENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
BIG IDEAS THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY ONE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A SMALL
IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA AS LONG AS IT CAN BE SHARED BECAUSE IF IT CAN BE SHARED THEN WHAT WE'LL HAVE IS PROSPERITY AND WEALTH AND WE HOPE THAT THROUGH THIS EXAMPLE IN RIO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IN THE PAST
A GIRLS THE CASTING CALL READS THESE ARE THE HOTTEST OF THE HOTTEST MODELS MUST HAVE REAL HAIR NO EXTENSIONS WELL SINCE I HAVE
TIME BAKING IN THE SUN NOT SO MUCH SO I SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN
A YOUNG AGE AND THESE MESSAGES THAT WE INTERNALIZE THEY STAY WITH US THEY STAYED WITH ME
RACISM COLORISM THE DISCRIMINATION OF THOSE WITH A DARKER SKIN TONE TYPICALLY
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IN MY WORLD THIS PHENOMENON IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR SOMETHING JUST AS SINISTER AND
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THESE MESSAGES THAT WE SEE AT A YOUNG AGE HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON US
IN 2010 CNN DID A STUDY WHERE THEY INTERVIEWED YOUNG CHILDREN JUST FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS OLD
AND ASKED THEM TO PLACE VALUES AND ATTRIBUTES TO PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR SKIN TONE
HERE'S A CLIP FROM THAT STUDY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER CAN I GET AWAY WITH BEING MEDIUM SKIN TONED BUT SINCE I'VE COME BACK TO SUNNY CALIFORNIA WHERE I SPEND ALL
FEMALES BY WHITE MALE SLAVE MASTERS GAVE BIRTH TO A COHORT OF MIXED RACE SLAVE CHILDREN THESE MIXED RACE SLAVES ARE RELATED TO THE SLAVE MASTERS AND HAD
COMMON COMPLIMENT I WOULD OFTEN GET IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL OFTEN TOLD TO ME BY OTHER BLACK MALES IT WENT TO THE EFFECT OF OH YOU'RE SO PRETTY
FOR DARK SKINNED GIRL AND
IT DOESN'T HELP THAT THE MEDIA CONTINUES TO PLACE A PREMIUM ON LIGHTER SKIN BY RETOUCHING AND PHOTOSHOPPING THE SKIN OF ACTRESSES OF COLOR BEFORE PUTTING THEM ON THE COVER OF MAGAZINES
AS CAN BE SEEN
THESE BEAUTY PREFERENCES THAT WE HAVE THEY'RE NOT SOMETHING WE ARE BORN WITH
THEY'RE LEARNED
AND IF THEY'RE LEARNED
THEY CAN BE UNLEARNED
AMONG US ARE CEOS AND CO FOUNDERS DIRECTORS OF MARKETING
YOU ALL ARE THE ARBITERS OF WHAT SOCIETY CONSIDERS BEAUTIFUL BY DECIDING WHO YOU CHOSE TO PUT IN YOUR ADVERTISING OR WHO YOU CHOSE TO BE THE FACE OF YOU BRAND
SO YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE UNCONVENTIONAL CHOICE
AND THOSE OF US THAT CONSUME THESE MESSAGES WE PLAY OUR ROLE TOO
THE LAST TEST WAS CALLED THE SHADOW TEST WHERE THEY WOULD TAKE A FLASHLIGHT AND SHINE IT AGAINST YOUR
FEATURES AND WERE GIVEN PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT AND ALLOWED TO WORK INSIDE THE HOUSE DOING LESS STRENUOUS WORK AS OPPOSED TO THE DARKER SKINNED SLAVES THAT HAD TO WORK OUT IN THE FIELDS DOING MORE LABORIOUS WORK EVEN AFTER SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED WHITES STILL GAVE MORE
THE WORLD IN INDIA AND ASIA ALONE SKIN LIGHTENING AND SKIN
SCREEN AND SEE THAT WE ARE FIERCE AND BEAUTIFUL AND DESIRABLE SO I FELT BETRAYED NOT EVEN IN THESE SMALL CIRCLES I'M ALLOWED TO FEEL BEAUTIFUL I FELT SHOVED
TO THE LAST CATEGORY
THE D GIRLS
THE CASTING CALL READS
THESE ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN GIRLS
POOR
NOT IN GOOD SHAPE
MUST HAVE A DARKER SKIN TONE
A DARKER SKIN TONE
WELL I
GUESS THAT'S ME
A D GIRL
IT STAYS WITH ME AND
IT MAKES ME QUESTION MY INTENTIONS
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I SAY THAT I HAVE THESE EXTENSIONS JUST FOR FUN AND THAT I LIKE THEM THAT VOICE SAYS NO
YOU GOT THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH A BEAUTY STANDARD YOU CAN ACTUALLY NEVER OBTAIN
IT STAYS WITH ME
EVEN AS I GO TO SEND A SIMPLE TEXT MESSAGE THAT VOICE
IN MY HEAD TELLS ME THAT I SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED OR ASHAMED WHEN I
I'M SO EXCITED
I'M FROM LA SO THIS MOVIE IS PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO MY HEART
I SAW IT IN THEATERS THREE TIMES
SO I'M CRUISING THE INTERNET DEVOURING EVERYTHING I CAN ABOUT THIS MOVIE I COME ACROSS THE CASTING CALL
THIS MOVIE HAS ALREADY COME OUT AND I'M NO ACTRESS SO I WOULDN'T ACTUALLY AUDITION BUT
I JUST WONDERED
HYPOTHETICALLY
IF I DID
WHAT ROLE WOULD I GET
TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST EACH OTHER
THEY WOULD ONLY ALLOW ENTRANCE INTO SORORITIES FRATERNITIES OR ELITE SOCIAL CLUBS TO BLACKS THAT WERE ABLE TO DISPLAY ANGLO TYPE FEATURES
THEY'D GO THROUGH A SERIES OF TESTS TO SEE IF YOU FIT THE BILL
ONE WELL KNOWN TEST WAS
THE
CAN HAVE EXTENSIONS MUST BE MEDIUM TO LIGHT SKIN TONED NOW MAYBE BACK WHEN I
BRAND VASELINE EVEN PARTNERED WITH FACEBOOK TO COME UP WITH AN APP THAT WOULD LIGHTEN THE
NOT JUST ISOLATED TO THE US ITS EFFECTS ARE GLOBAL AS BEST ILLUSTRATED BY THE SKIN LIGHTENING AND SKIN BLEACHING CREAMS
WILL SEE THE WORLD JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PASSIVELY ACCEPT WHAT SOCIETY TELLS US TO THINK IS BEAUTIFUL
WE CAN QUESTION IT AND
WE CAN CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO
BECAUSE WHEN WE DO
WE GET ONE STEP CLOSER TO BROADENING THE STANDARD OF BEAUTY
AND CREATING A SOCIETY WHERE THE WORLD CAN SEE THAT D GIRLS ARE BEAUTIFUL TOO
DESPITE THE HARMFUL TOXINS THAT ARE PRESENT IN THESE PRODUCTS PEOPLE ARE STILL WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK AND USE THEM IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY ARE LED TO BELIEVE IS BEAUTIFUL
FAVORABLE FEATURES LIGHT SKIN LIGHT EYES LONG SOFT REAL HAIR
HIT HERE LIGHT SKIN ALSO NOT ME AND MIGHT I ADD NOT EVEN BEYONC MADE THE CUT TO BE AN A GIRL
GARDNER'S NOTION OF MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES I THINK IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY RIGHT THERE
OF THE HIERARCHY YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE TIGER WOODS OR OPRAH WINFREY OR WHAT HAVE YOU
IDEA ABOUT WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BEHIND THIS DATA SO YOU CAN INTERPOLATE WHERE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THINGS BEFORE
UNDERSTAND WHAT A PARKING SIGN IS WHAT A STICKER IS WHAT REFRIGERATOR IS WHAT DRINKS ARE SO IT'S LOOKING FOR THE NEAREST THING IN ITS DATABASE WHICH IS THIS MELANGE OF COLORS BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BUT IT MATTERS WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE MEDICINE WE WANT THE AI TO REALLY DO IT RIGHT WELL BUILDING LADDERS THAT ARE
YOU START BY DETECTING LOW LEVEL THINGS ABOUT THE IMAGE LIKE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIGHT AND
SPECTRUM PUT TOGETHER LAST YEAR AFTER THE DARPA COMPETITION DARPA WAS TRYING TO HAVE PEOPLE BUILD EMERGENCY ROBOTS AND PEOPLE DID ALL KINDS OF WORK IN THEIR LAB TO BUILD ROBOTS THAT COULD DO THINGS LIKE
THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE SITTING BELOW THE CHAINSAW AND NOT GOOD FOR THE ROBOT YOU DON'T WANT TO LEARN THIS ON THE BASIS OF BIG DATA YOU WANT TO
NOW WHY ARE YOU WEARING A HAT NOW SHE'S CONSTANTLY ASKING WHY QUESTIONS THIS IS HER BROTHER HE'S A LITTLE OLDER
GOOD AT SMALL DATA BUT MACHINES STILL AREN'T VERY GOOD AT IT PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THERE'S LITTLE DEPTH OF UNDERSTANDING NOT EVEN COMMON
ALL THE THINGS I'LL SHOW YOU WERE WELL PRACTICED BY THE LABS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THIS COMPETITION BUT AS YOU'LL SEE THE RESULTS LEFT
THE EQUIVALENT OF GOOGLE SEARCH THEY'RE DOING KEYWORD SEARCH AND HISTORY OF THE PLANET 65 MILLION YEARS AGO DINOSAURS
STUMPED THE MACHINE I'M PRETTY SURE THAT YOUR NEURAL NET WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IS AN UNUSUAL SCENE THAT YOU DON'T SEE A DOG DOING BENCH PRESS EVERYDAY
I TOLD YOU LIKE YOU HAVE TIGER WOODS A PICTURE OF HIM AND YOU HAVE THE LABEL PICTURE OF A GOLF BALL AND A GOLF BALL
THE DOG IT MIGHT NOT BECAUSE THE EARS ARE IN A CONFIGURATION THAT DOG EARS ALMOST NEVER
WITH WHAT BUT WHY ARE THE THINGS IN THE WORLD RELATED TO
UNDERSTOOD HOW TO PROGRAM INTO A MACHINE THE FLEXIBILITY OF HUMAN
OUR OWN THAT OUR BRAINS BASICALLY AREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE THE COMPLEXITY OF SO
THE CURRENT STATE OF THE WORLD AND DIRECTLY REFLECTING THAT IN HIS
MUCH FASTER MORE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT THIS WATCH THAT I HAVE CAN DO EVERYTHING THE ENIAC COULD DO WITH AN ENTIRE ROOM 60 YEARS AGO AND YET
THERE'S MORE YOU CAN SEE ON YOUTUBE LATER BUT THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH MOCKING THOSE PARTICULAR SETS OF ROBOTS THE BROADER
WORKING ON SMALL PROBLEMS LIKE HOW TO SELL MORE ADVERTISING AND THINGS LIKE THAT
MAKE FASTER HARDWARE BUT RESEARCHERS WHO LOOK AT COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE THINK MAYBE WE COULD MAKE SOME PROGRESS I'M NOT SAYING
TECHNIQUE FOR THIS NOW IS CALLED A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK WHICH WAS INVENTED BY MY NYU COLLEAGUE YANN LECUN THE IDEA IS YOU
THE ABSTRACT IDEAS THE LOGICAL INFERENCES AND SO
CHOICE EXAM ORIGINALLY DRAWN FROM EIGHTH GRADER QUESTIONS MADE BY PAUL ALLEN'S ALLEN AI
OR THE ABILITY OF A CHILD TODDLER TINY TODDLER TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE TRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TO SCHOOL TODAY IF YOU'VE WORKED WITH SIRI YOU KNOW THAT SYNTAX IS STILL CHALLENGE SOMETIMES FOR COMPUTERS HE
YEARS LATER THERE'S MUCH HYPE ABOUT DEEP LEARNING AND BILLIONS WORTH OF INVESTMENT BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD PROGRESS ON THE
THIS WAS A PAPER THAT SAID HEY WOW THESE DEEP LEARNING SYSTEMS THEY CAN CAPTION IMAGES NOW IF THEY REALLY COULD DO THAT PERFECTLY I WOULD BE REALLY IMPRESSED BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW IS CERTAIN CASES THAT WORK REALLY WELL AND OTHERS NOT SO WELL HERE'S A
CAN DO VERY WELL THEY CAN IDENTIFY A PERSON YOU TRAIN THEM ON A LOT OF DATA ABOUT SOME
BUT WE ARE BETTER AT ASKING WHY AND UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE MAYBE WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING
REPACKAGE THIS I WORK IN BRANDING I CAN REPACKAGE THIS AND ACTUALLY MAKE IT
SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR ME AND THAT I ENJOY
SO I'M STILL DEALING WITH THE SAME THING
BUT I'M DEALING WITH IT IN A WAY THAT LEADS ME TO POSITIVITY AND HAPPINESS ULTIMATELY
AND I'D LOVE TO SHARE WITH
I FEEL LIKE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
ANYONE'S TIME BE IMPATIENT WITH YOURSELF AND DON'T SETTLE I COULD HAVE VERY EASILY HIDDEN IN A CORNER WITH SLIPPERS ON ON A CHAIR DONE NOTHING FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE JUDGED ME FOR IT
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THE WAY THAT I FEEL ABOUT THE WORLD IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT I WOULD
MOOD YOUR MOVEMENTS THE WAY YOUR BRAIN COMMUNICATES WITH EVERY SINGLE MUSCLE IN YOUR BODY YOU'RE FIGHTING A BATTLE AGAINST YOUR BRAIN AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN BUT I
A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE I DON'T SLEEP EVER BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TRY NEW THINGS WHEN YOU SUDDENLY GET THROWN INTO A SITUATION
PEOPLE ARE FEELING THAT TOLERANCE COMES BACK TO YOU LIKE A BOOMERANG BECAUSE IF YOU'RE KIND TO OTHER PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE ULTIMATELY KIND TO YOU IT TAKES SOMETIMES A WHILE TO GET THERE AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME KIND PERSON BUT IT COMES BACK TO YOU EVENTUALLY WEAR
PLACE EVERYONE'S RUSHING TO GET SOMEWHERE AND DO SOMETHING AND PUSHING OTHER PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY AND IT'S NICE TO TAKE THE TIME TO
BY BEING KIND TO OTHER PEOPLE AND REALIZING THAT YOU KNOW THE GUY THAT PUSHES PAST YOU ON THE TRAIN HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A REALLY RUBBISH DAY AT WORK THE
AND THAT MEANT THAT
WHEN I LOOKED FOR THEM THEY WERE THERE AND I KNEW THAT I WAS SORTED AND STURDY AND SUPPORTED
SOMETIMES IF YOU THINK PEOPLE GOING TO BE THERE
YOU'RE NOT 100 SURE UNTIL YOU NEED THEM WHETHER THEY ARE YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THEM IN THE PAST THEY MIGHT HOLD A GRUDGE
AND HAVING A SUPPORT NETWORK WHEN SOMETHING BAD'S HAPPENING OR WHEN GOOD STUFF IS HAPPENING IS REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
IT'S GREAT TO STAND ON YOUR OWN BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A TEAM AROUND YOU THAT ARE THERE CHEERING YOU ON
DAY IT'S OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN BASE ON THAT OLD SAYING WHICH I LOVE WHICH IS YOU CAN COVER TURD IN GLITTER BUT IT WILL STILL BE A TURD ESSENTIALLY {NS}
IF YOU GO SEARCHING FOR IT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND ANYTHING LONG TERM
I'VE LOOKED FOR IT IN THE FORM OF MEN ON WHITE HORSES CARRYING ARMOUR AND THINGS LIKE THAT I'VE LOOKED FOR IT IN THE BOTTOM OF H AGEN DAZS TUBS I'VE LOOKED FOR IT IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SCROLLING PAGE ON ASOS I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR IT
AND ULTIMATELY YOU FIND HAPPINESS
FOR FLEETING TIME WITH THOSE THINGS BUT HAPPINESS COMES FROM WITHIN AND I KNOW THAT'S A MASSIVE MASSIVE CLICH PROBABLY EVERYONE'S TOLD YOU IT A THOUSAND TIMES BUT
IF YOU'RE HAPPY IN YOURSELF AND WHO YOU ARE
THEN YOU PROMOTE HAPPINESS TO OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT COMES BACK TO YOU SEVENFOLD THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU WILL BE HAPPIER AS WELL
I CAN'T CONTROL MY OWN SLIDES BECAUSE MY HANDS ARE SHAKING TOO MUCH SO SOMEONE'S CONTROLLING THEM FOR ME IT'S YOU THAT'S WHERE I NEED TO LOOK THANK YOU
AND IT BECAME THE DAY THAT I KNEW WHERE MY SUPPORT NETWORK WAS THAT THEY WERE AROUND ME THEY WERE THERE FOR GOOD TO HELP ME AND EVERY TEXT I GOT I GOT MORE AND MORE POSITIVE IN RETURN ONE OF MY JUNIORS AT WORK SENT ME A
AND IT'S LOOKING INTO PEOPLE'S EYES WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM IT'S BEING MORE TOLERANT TO PEOPLE AND KNOWING THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME ULTIMATELY
TO CLUBS AND GET AWAY WITH MURDER IT'S FANTASTIC BUT SOME PEOPLE TROT AROUND TOWN ALL THE TIME IN HEELS AND I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM I FEEL SORRY THEY HAVE TO WEAR HEELS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE NO ONE IS HAPPY IN HEELS NO ONE IF THEY'RE SAYING THEY ARE THEY'RE LYING
LIKE THAT BEING DIAGNOSED MADE ME REALISE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THOSE THINGS TO HELP PEOPLE WE HAVE A MOUTH WE HAVE ARMS WE CAN DO THINGS TO HELP
TOOK ME FOR BRAIN SCANS AND I THOUGHT OOH WE'RE GETTING SERIOUS NOW THIS IS GETTING A BIT
IT'S KIND OF RISKY TERRITORY
BUT I'M STILL THINKING PROBABLY A TRAPPED NERVE OR A CARPAL TUNNEL AT WORST I WAS NEVER THINKING ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS
AND THE BRAIN SCANS
WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR THEM THEY SAID TO ME
IT COULD BE PARKINSON'S DISEASE IT COULD BE HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE OR IT COULD BE WILSON'S DISEASE
AND IN THE WEIRDEST THING THAT ANYONE'S PROBABLY EVER THOUGHT I WAS ROOTING FOR PARKINSON'S BECAUSE THE OTHER ONES YOU DIE FROM AND I WASN'T READY TO DIE 29
IS PRACTICALLY SUICIDE PROOF SUICIDE FROM THE BRIDGE IS NEITHER PRACTICAL NOR PROBABLE
TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THAT ONCE THE PERSON IS ON THAT CORD
HI KEVIN I IMAGINE YOU'RE AT THE TED CONFERENCE THAT MUST BE QUITE THE EXPERIENCE TO BE THERE I'M THINKING I SHOULD GO WALK THE BRIDGE THIS WEEKEND
TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE ON THIS BRIDGE AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF SPEAKING WITH JASON HE ASKED US IF WE KNEW THE STORY OF PANDORA'S BOX
OBSERVED JASON SPEAKING TO A GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE OFFICER JASON WAS JUST 32 YEARS OLD AND HAD FLOWN OUT HERE FROM NEW JERSEY AS MATTER OF FACT HE HAD FLOWN OUT HERE ON TWO OTHER OCCASIONS FROM NEW
AND SHE WROTE THIS ME THIS EMAIL JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND IT'S WITH HER PERMISSION AND BLESSING THAT I READ THIS TO YOU
ACT ALTHOUGH ENDING HIS OWN PAIN ROBBED ME FROM EVER GETTING TO KNOW HIM
THAT IMPACT SHATTERS BONES SOME OF WHICH THEN PUNCTURE VITAL ORGANS MOST DIE ON IMPACT THOSE THAT DON'T GENERALLY FLAIL IN THE WATER HELPLESSLY AND THEN DROWN
AND TOLD HER NEVER EVER OPEN THAT BOX WELL ONE DAY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF PANDORA AND SHE DID OPEN THE BOX
WOULD YOU SAY WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT JUST THE TALKING THAT YOU DO BUT THE LISTENING LISTEN TO UNDERSTAND
I'M STILL PRETTY NUMB BUT NOTICING MORE MOMENTS OF REALLY REALIZING MIKE ISN'T COMING HOME
I SUPPOSE THAT WHEN I WAS SPEAKING WITH THEM THAT I DIDN'T SOUND AS IF I WAS DOING VERY WELL
BECAUSE THAT VERY NEXT DAY
THEIR FAMILY RABBI CALLED TO CHECK ON ME
JASON'S PARENTS HAD ASKED HIM TO DO SO
THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF SUICIDE AFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE
ONLY GOOD THING IN THE BOX WAS HOPE JASON THEN ASKED US WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPEN THE BOX AND HOPE ISN'T THERE
WAY OF ASKING THEM THE QUESTION IS LIKE THIS OTHERS IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ENDING THEIR LIFE HAVE YOU HAD THESE THOUGHTS CONFRONTING THE PERSON HEAD ON
WHEN I FIRST BEGAN WORKING ON THE BRIDGE WE HAD NO FORMAL TRAINING YOU STRUGGLED TO FUNNEL YOUR WAY THROUGH THESE CALLS
GOOD LUCK THIS WEEK VICKY I CAN'T IMAGINE THE COURAGE IT TAKES FOR HER TO GO DOWN TO THAT BRIDGE AND WALK THE
VISITED SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL THAT EVENING YOU WERE LISTED AS THE PATIENT BOY DID I HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN THAT ONE OUT
THEIR DARKEST TIME IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BRING THEM BACK I TOOK THIS PHOTO LAST
ON THAT FINAL HANDSHAKE HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID KEVIN I'M SORRY BUT HAVE TO GO
DEATH
IN MY CAREER I'VE RESPONDED TO AND BEEN INVOLVED IN HUNDREDS
OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUICIDE CALLS AROUND THE BRIDGE
OF THOSE INCIDENTS I'VE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH I'VE ONLY LOST TWO
BUT THAT'S TWO TOO MANY
JUST WANTED TO DROP YOU A NOTE HOPE YOU GET THE WORD OUT TO MANY PEOPLE AND THEY GO HOME TALKING ABOUT IT TO THEIR FRIENDS WHO TELL THEIR FRIENDS ETC
I TRULY BELIEVE KEVIN WAS CRYING OUT FOR HELP HE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN PROPERLY MEDICATED
RECENTLY RETIRED FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AFTER 23 YEARS OF SERVICE THE MAJORITY OF THOSE 23 YEARS WAS SPENT PATROLLING THE SOUTHERN END OF MARIN COUNTY WHICH INCLUDES THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
IS PREVENTABLE THERE IS HELP
HASN'T BEEN LOW BEFORE WITHOUT SUFFERING FROM A TRUE MENTAL ILLNESS IT SHOULDN'T BE SO EASY TO END IT MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU FOR YOUR FIGHT
DEAR MR BRIGGS NOTHING WILL ERASE THE EVENTS OF MARCH 11 BUT YOU ARE ONE OF THE REASONS KEVIN IS STILL WITH US
HAD JUST COMMITTED SUICIDE I SPOKE WITH JASON'S PARENTS THAT EVENING
HE LEAPT HORRIBLE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE I DO WANT TO TELL YOU THOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOLKS THAT WE
TALK ABOUT IT THAT ONE TO TWO PERCENT MOST OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE SAID THAT THE SECOND THAT THEY LET GO OF THAT RAIL THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND THEY WANTED TO LIVE
TO RADIO CALL OF A POSSIBLE SUICIDAL SUBJECT ON THE BRIDGE SIDEWALK NEAR THE NORTH
DECIDED ON HIS OWN THAT DAY TO COME BACK OVER THAT RAIL AND GIVE LIFE ANOTHER CHANCE WHEN KEVIN CAME BACK OVER I CONGRATULATED HIM
AFTER A FREE FALL OF FOUR TO FIVE SECONDS THE BODY STRIKES THE WATER AT ABOUT 75 MILES AN HOUR
AND A LOSS OF INTEREST IN LIFE
I CAME UP
WITH THIS TALK JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A LADY
THAT I'D LIKE TO READ
YOU HER LETTER
SHE LOST HER SON
BY JUST BEING THERE YOU MAY JUST BE THE TURNING POINT THAT THEY NEED IF YOU THINK SOMEONE
KEVIN WHEN HE WAS ONLY SIX MONTHS OLD COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF ANY HEREDITARY TRAITS BUT THANK GOD NOW WE KNOW
TOOK THAT DAY AND ALSO THE COURAGE JUST TO CARRY ON
I TELL PEOPLE THE BRIDGE NOT ONLY CONNECTS MARIN TO SAN FRANCISCO BUT PEOPLE TOGETHER ALSO THAT
MADE IT THERE
I CALLED PETALUMA POLICE
AND REPORTED HIM MISSING THAT EVENING
THE NEXT MORNING
TWO OFFICERS CAME TO MY HOME
AND REPORTED THAT MIKE'S CAR WAS DOWN AT THE BRIDGE
MAY JUST SAVE THEIR LIFE AND BE THE TURNING POINT FOR THEM SOME OTHER SIGNS TO LOOK FOR HOPELESSNESS BELIEVING THAT THINGS ARE TERRIBLE AND NEVER GOING TO GET BETTER
THIS WAS NOT ONLY A DISSERVICE
TO THOSE CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE
BUT TO THE OFFICERS AS WELL
WE'VE COME A LONG LONG WAY SINCE THEN
NOW VETERAN OFFICERS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS TRAIN NEW OFFICERS
YOU TO ANOTHER DIMENSION THIS BRIDGE HAS BEEN ROMANTICIZED AS SUCH
A NEW BEGINNING A NEW LIFE BUT I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU COME BACK AND GIVE HOPE AND LIFE ANOTHER CHANCE AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD ME HE SAID YOU LISTENED
A CERTAIN PIECE OF DATA A FEATURE IS ON THE OUTPUT THE PREDICTION THE ACTION THE THOUGHT
SO THESE INPUTS THESE FEATURES ARE MULTIPLIED BY THE WEIGHTS
FED THROUGH THE NETWORK AND OUT COMES PREDICTION
BUT THIS PREDICTION CAN BE SO FAR OFF
CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN WE CRACK THE CODE TO OUR OWN SENTIENCE THEY WILL FOLLOW RIGHT BEHIND US
AND WHEN THEY DO
WHAT WILL WE BECOME
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR OWN CREATION
BECOMES EXACTLY LIKE US
IN A 2016 ELECTION
THE ECONOMIC FABRIC OF SOCIETY WILL TRANSFORM IT WILL BE TURNED ON ITS HEAD AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE STATUS QUO WILL CHANGE IN
FOR WORKER PROTECTIONS BECAUSE MACHINES ARE THE ONES MANUFACTURING YOUR BED SETS YOUR COMPUTERS
TO FORM HARVARD RESEARCHERS RECENTLY DISCOVERED A
ON INTO THE GRADE 12 A HEALTHIER SOCIETY A BETTER SOCIETY A MORE WELL EDUCATED SOCIETY A SOCIETY WHERE YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE YOUR NEXT NO' WILL COME FROM A SOCIETY WHERE YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO SEE
WHAT ROLE WILL YOU PLAY WHAT WILL YOU BECOME THANK YOU {NS} {NS}
IN A WORLD WHERE THEY WORK FOR US WE WILL GRASP FOR THE STARS AS IF THEY WERE IN OUR OWN BACKYARD SO WILL THEY REPLACE US OR WILL THEY
SCIENTISTS INSERT ELECTRONIC MESH INTO YOUR BRAIN ALLOWING YOU TO UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD YOUR THOUGHTS FROM A COMPUTER
IF WE ARE TO PREVENT OURSELVES FROM BECOMING OBSOLETE AND IRRELEVANT IN A WORLD WHICH WE ONCE REIGNED OVER
WE MUST MERGE WITH MACHINE
WE MUST AUGMENT OUR PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES WE MUST AUGMENT OUR INTELLECTUAL CAPACITIES
OTHERWISE
WE'RE DOOMED TO EXTINCTION
THE PERCEPTRON MODEL WE COMMONLY KNOW IT AS THE NEURAL NETWORK THE NEURAL NETWORK FUNCTIONS IN A SIMILAR FASHION TO OUR VERY OWN HUMAN BRAIN WE
NEW LIFE WE STAND ON THE PLATEAU OF AN EXPONENTIAL
BUT MANY I RECKON ARE SCARED FRIGHTENED HOW HUMAN WILL THEY BECOME
ONES WHAT WILL WE BECOME WHAT HAPPENS TO THE HUMAN BEING WELL
SO HOW FAR HAVE WE COME SINCE ELIZA HOW FAR HAS HUMANITY TRAVERSED SINCE THAT FIRST PERCEPTRON MODEL GOOGLE'S DEEPMIND TEAM
HOW WE ALL GO TO FIND OUR PURPOSE RIGHT {LG} THERE ARE APPS OR COURSE AND COACHES AS A LIFE COACH PEOPLE PAY ME TO HELP THEM ANSWER THEIR BIG QUESTIONS AND IT'S
SHE WAS WORRIED BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T YET HAVE ANY PASSION IN LIFE
SHE ESPECIALLY LIKED THIS FIRST STEP
BECAUSE WHEN I ASKED HER WHAT HUNGER FELT LIKE IN HER
SHE SAID EMPTY
AND SHE REALIZED THAT SHE AVOIDED FEELINGS OF EMPTINESS IN HER LIFE
BUT NOW
TO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF NOURISHMENT IN YOUR LIFE WHAT ARE YOU IN THE MOOD FOR
SO LONG HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GET ONE BUT HE ASKED AROUND FOUND A LITTLE BISTRO HE'D NEVER BEEN TO BEFORE
AND TOLD ME HE HAD THE BEST LUNCH EVER
THIS BRINGS US TO THE THIRD STEPS WHICH IS WHEN YOU DO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR DECIDE WHERE TO GO TO GET IT
WHERE IN THE WORLD
CAN YOU GET YOUR DESIRE FULFILLED
MAYBE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO GO TO GET THE BEST FRENCH DIP SANDWICH
BUT IF NOT
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE A SET OF SKILLS
RESEARCHING
GATHERING
GAVE HIM THE LUNCH CHALLENGE AND ON DAY ONE
MARK DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS IN THE MOOD FOR
HE WENT TO THE SAME SANDWICH SHOP HE'D GO TO OFTEN
GOT THE TURKEY SANDWICH
NOT BECAUSE HE REALLY WANTED THAT TURKEY SANDWICH
BUT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM HIS USUAL AND
HE WONDERED IF HE HAD DONE THAT WRONG IF
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WAITED FOR SOME STRONG CRAVING TO COME OVER HIM
AND I TOLD HIM THAT WHAT WE WERE GOING FOR
WAS THE FEELING OF WANTING SOMETHING
AND
AND YOU'RE HUNGRY RIGHT NOW FOR MEANING AND FULFILMENT YOU'VE PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT
YOU MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY THOUGHT YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE ANSWERS
STOP THINKING
START WITH LUNCH
IT'S A SMALL VIRTUALLY RISK FREE DECISION
BUT EACH TIME YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT FOR LUNCH
YOU'RE PRACTICING THE STEPS THAT TOGETHER REVEAL YOUR BIGGER DESIRES
IMAGINE
THAT GAP BETWEEN LACK AND FULFILMENT IS UNCONFORTABLE
BUT IT'S THE DISCOMFORT THAT MOVES US FORWARD
AFTER ALL IF WE NEVER GOT HUNGRY THERE WOULD BE NO COMPULSION FOR US TO STOP WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR DAY TO GET LUNCH
WE NEED A REASON TO STOP WHAT WE'RE DOING TO GO DO SOMETHING ELSE
I
THE FOURTH STEP WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE COUNTER TO ORDER PAY ATTENTION TO THAT MOMENT THIS IS YOU DECLARING YOUR DESIRE OUT LOUD TO SOMEONE ELSE AND
WHAT IF THEY GOT THE ORDER WRONG NO PROBLEM THIS IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR A SET OF SKILLS THIS TIME TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF AND MAKE IT RIGHT HOW
HAPPEN
IF YOU KEEP IT ALL TO YOURSELF IT
WOULD BE KIND OF LIKE SITTING IN A RESTAURANT HUNGRY BUT NOT ORDERING
THE FIFTH STEP
IS TO BE MINDFUL ALSO ABOUT WHEN YOU PAY FOR YOUR LUNCH
THIS IS YOUR INVESTMENT YOU
HAVE TO
UNTIL HE COULD GET ESTABLISHED SO THEY TIMED THEIR TRANSITION TO TAKE PLACE WHEN THEIR YOUNGEST WAS ENTERING KINDERGARTEN THIS GAVE MARK'S WIFE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK TO WORK
ANSWER LIKE JUST A GENRE OF FOOD
THAT'S OK THIS IS WHAT THE LUNCH CHALLENGE IS ABOUT KEEP ASKING THE QUESTION OF THE PLACES YOU KNOW HOLD THE ANSWER
IT WILL GET EASIER AND YOUR ANSWERS WILL GET MORE SPECIFIC
I WORKED WITH A MAN NAMED
THERE'S DESIRE AND WHERE'S THERE'S DESIRE THERE'S PASSION THE SECOND STEP IN THE LUNCH CHALLENGE IS TO ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION WHAT AM I IN THE MOOD FOR NOW
FOR IN YOUR LIFE
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPERIENCE
OR CREATE
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WHETHER WE CALL IT PURPOSE OR PASSION OR CALLING
MANY OF US ARE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL REALLY NOURISH US
AND THIS SEARCH CAN BE DAUNTING
IN
AND EAT NOW JUST BE IN AWE HERE WITH ME FOR ONE MOMENT BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING YOU WENT FROM
IS BOTH A PRACTICE AND A METAPHORE FOR THE STEPS INVOLVED IN FIGURING OUT WHAT YOU WANT AND ULTIMATELY GETTING IT WE CAN DO THE FIRST STEP HERE IF YOU'D LIKE HOW MANY OF YOU ARE STARTING TO GET HUNGRY FOR LUNCH
FOR
WHAT ARE WE WILLING TO GIVE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE
SHAPING THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIVES
WITH THEIR ANSWERS
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT WAS A JOURNEY
BUT IT STARTED WITH LUNCH
IT AND TOGETHER THEY TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE WILLING TO INVEST TO MAKE THIS CHANGE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE CAREER CHANGE WOULD MEAN A REDUCTION OF
WHICH IS SOMETHING SHE'S BEEN PLANNING ON AND IT HELPED BRIDGE SOME OF THAT FINANCIAL GAP AND IT
MARK WHAT HE KNEW SO FAR ABOUT WHAT HE WANTED HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED CAREER WISE BUT HE DID KNOW THAT HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIFE GIVING NOT DEPLETING HE WAS TALKING ABOUT NOURISHMENT
ARE ALSO NOT SO SURE ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT WHEN IT COMES TO SMALL DAY TO DAY CHOICES THEY FACE AND I WONDERED HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FOR LUNCH SO I CREATED
FINGERS INTO THE GROOVE OF YOUR THROAT AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL YOUR HEART RATE YOUR PULSE IN YOUR NECK YOU'RE GOING TO COUNT IT FOR SIX SECONDS AND THERE'S GOING TO BE TIMER
HERE ON THE WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND HE HAD A LIFE THREATENING HEART RHYTHM PROBLEM HE GETS ADMITTED TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL AND VICTOR HIS CARDIOLOGIST DECIDES WITH HIM THAT HE REQUIRES A DEFIBRILLATOR INSERTED INTO HIS HEART
WITH A COMPANY TAKE A MOMENT TO ASK SOMEBODY A USER A CO WORKER SOMEBODY WHO WORKS FOR YOU WHAT MATTERS TO THEM IT'S STARTED IN HEALTH WE'RE NOW
STARTED TO SPREAD THIS AROUND SCOTLAND'S HOSPITALS JENNIFER RODGERS WHO WAS NURSE OF THE YEAR IN 2014 IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH
TO THE HOSPITAL DON COULD GO TRIM PRUNE AND WATER THE FUCHSIAS IN THE CAR PARK OF THE HOSPITAL THEY INSERTED HIS DEFIBRILLATOR HE DID WELL HE WAS DISCHARGED AND WENT BACK HOME YOU SEE THE
GET MORE ANXIOUS IF I'M NOT CONNECTED TO THIS JOB I DO AND MAYBE A LITTLE ASPIRATIONAL FOR THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE I'D LIKE A CAPPUCCINO FOR BREAKFAST
THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE ADVANCED FOR US TO DO IN A BIG ROOM LIKE THIS I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A NEW VITAL SIGN A VITAL SIGN ABOUT COMPASSION
TO YOU POSTER TO COMPLETE THIS IS PAIGE'S WHAT MATTERS TO YOU IT DOESN'T INCLUDE PLEASE GIVE ME MY CHEMOTHERAPY ON TIME THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WRITE THEY WRITE I LIKE IT WHEN THE NURSES NICE AND
THING TO DO IN A VERY BUSY CARE OF THE ELDERLY WARD ROSE DIDN'T GET MANY VISITORS SHE DIDN'T HAVE MANY FAMILY ALIVE BUT ONE DAY NIECE CAME TO VISIT THAT NIECE SAT BESIDE HER AND ONE OF THE NURSES HAD A WHAT MATTERS TO YOU CONVERSATION WITH HER
I'M MARRIED TO LYNNE MY SISTER'S CALLED VANESSA I'VE GOT MUM AND DAD CALLED JIM AND IRENE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN ATHENS ON A CRUISE TODAY WHICH IS MAKING ME SLIGHTLY JEALOUS
AND SHE HAD DEMENTIA SHE WAS VERY CONFUSED VERY AGITATED SHE GOT UP FROM BED LOT FELL OVER THAT'S VERY COMPLEX THING TO DEAL WITH IN A HOSPITAL WARD YOU PUT THE SIDES OF THE BED UP SO YOU TRAP THE
LIKE IT WHEN MY RIDICULOUSLY LARGE SIMBA TEDDY IS WITH ME ALL THE TIME AND
SO WE PUT NOTICES NOW ABOVE THE BEDS WHERE IT SAYS WHAT MATTERS TO ME IS MY ROSARY BEADS AND PEOPLE WOULD STOP AND SIT BESIDE ROSE COMPLETE STRANGERS OTHER VISITORS FOR OTHER
WERE THEY WERE HIS LIFE THEY WERE WHAT HE DID HE PRUNED THEM HE WATERED THEM HE LOOKED AFTER THEM AND HE ENTERED COMPETITIONS WITH THEM THEY WERE MORE IMPORTANT TO DON THAN LIFE
BEEN A WHAT MATTERS TO YOU CONVERSATION WITH DON HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE DIED THAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WHAT MATTERS TO YOU CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING
DON DECIDES HE WANTS TO LEAVE HE TRIES TO SIGN HIMSELF OUT OF HOSPITAL VICTOR IS CALLED AND HE GOES TO SEE DON HE SITS BESIDE HIM AND HE HAS A WHAT MATTERS TO YOU
ALASKA IT TREATS THE NATIVE ALASKANS
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO VISIT IT IN JUNE LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED HERE YOU HEARD I WAS JASON LEITCH I WAS THE NATIONAL CLINICAL DIRECTOR OF
THE HEALTH SERVICE AND I HAD THIS AND THAT PROFESSIONALLY
WHEN YOU'RE IN ALASKA THAT'S NOT HOW YOU ARE INTRODUCED
PROFESSIONALS I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR LEFT HAND TAKE YOUR LEFT HAND THIS IS INTER ACTIVE
THAT DON LEFT THE HOSPITAL HAD HIS DEFIBRILLATOR INSERTED DID WELL WELL THE END OF THE STORY IS THAT DON ENTERED SCOTLAND'S FIVE INCH POT FUCHSIA COMPETITION WELL WHO KNEW
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE WE'VE ALSO SPREAD IT TO SOME CARE OF THE ELDERLY UNITS GERALDINE MARSH WHO'S A SENIOR NURSE IN THAT UNIT STARTED TO USE IT FOR REALLY CONFUSED AND COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED ADULTS
OWN HEART RATE AND YOUR OWN RESPIRATORY RATE YOU MIGHT HAVE A 16 A 20 A 24 YOU MIGHT HAVE A 12 DON'T WORRY IF YOU'VE GOT AN 8 YOU'RE JUST A BIT TIRED
AND FRIENDS TO VISIT WHENEVER I WANT NOT WHEN THEY WANTED
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO HER THEY TOOK THE ROSARY OUT OF THE DRAWER
I'M THE NATIONAL CLINICAL DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE DO YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE DO YOU KNOW ME A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU KNEW ME BEFORE THAT'S WHAT WHAT MATTERS TO YOU IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT COMPASSION AND CARE WITHIN
BED SO WHAT WOULD MY WHAT MATTERS TO ME LOOK LIKE THIS IS MY
DON TO THE FUCHSIAS SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID THEY GOT A VAN WITH THE POTS
BUT THE COOL THING ABOUT RUNNING AS I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT SOMETHING BIZARRE HAPPENS IN THIS ACTIVITY ALL THE TIME CASE IN POINT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO IF YOU SAW THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON I GUARANTEE YOU YOU SAW SOMETHING THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE AN
AND CANCER CRIME WARFARE AND VIOLENCE CLINICAL DEPRESSION ALL THIS STUFF
THE TARAHUMARA DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY ARE FREE FROM ALL OF THESE MODERN AILMENTS
SO WHAT'S THE CONNECTION AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUTLIERS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF CAUSE AND EFFECT
WELL THERE ARE TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS AT HARVARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH THAT ARE BENDING THEIR BRAINS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE TARAHUMARA HAVE KNOWN FOREVER
THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THOSE SAME KINDS OF MYSTERIES
AND
ONCE AGAIN A MYSTERY WRAPPED INSIDE OF A MYSTERY
PERHAPS THE KEY TO DERARTU TULU AND THE TARAHUMARA
IS WRAPPED IN THREE OTHER MYSTERIES WHICH GO LIKE THIS THREE
YEARS 64 YEAR OLD MEN AND WOMEN ARE RUNNING AS FAST AS THEY WERE AT AGE 19 NOW I DEFY YOU TO COME UP WITH ANY OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND PLEASE DON'T SAY GOLF SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY HARD
WHERE GERIATRICS ARE PERFORMING AS WELL AS THEY DID AS TEENAGERS SO YOU HAVE THESE THREE MYSTERIES
IS THERE ONE PIECE IN THE PUZZLE WHICH MIGHT WRAP ALL THESE THINGS UP
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL ANYTIME SOMEONE LOOKS BACK IN PREHISTORY AND TRIES TO GIVE YOU A GLOBAL ANSWER BECAUSE IT BEING PREHISTORY YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT AND GET AWAY WITH IT
BUT I'LL SUBMIT THIS TO YOU IF YOU PUT ONE PIECE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS JIGSAW PUZZLE SUDDENLY IT ALL STARTS TO FORM A COHERENT PICTURE IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY THE TARAHUMARA DON'T FIGHT AND DON'T DIE OF HEART DISEASE WHY A POOR ETHIOPIAN WOMAN NAMED DERARTU TULU CAN BE THE MOST COMPASSIONATE AND YET THE MOST COMPETITIVE AND WHY WE SOMEHOW WERE ABLE TO FIND FOOD WITHOUT WEAPONS
PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE HUMANS AS MUCH AS WE LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE
ACTUALLY EVOLVED AS NOTHING MORE THAN A PACK OF HUNTING DOGS
MAYBE WE EVOLVED AS
A HUNTING PACK ANIMAL
BECAUSE THE ONE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IN THE WILDERNESS AGAIN IT'S NOT OUR FANGS OUR CLAWS OR OUR SPEED THE ONLY THING WE DO REALLY WELL IS SWEAT WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT BEING SWEATY AND SMELLY
TULU RUINS THE SCRIPT AGAIN
INSTEAD OF LOSING SHE BLAZES PAST THE LEAD PACK AND WINS
WINS THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON GOES HOME WITH A BIG FAT CHECK
IT'S A HEARTWARMING STORY BUT IF YOU DRILL A LITTLE BIT DEEPER YOU'VE GOT TO SORT OF WONDER ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS GOING ON THERE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO OUTLIERS IN ONE ORGANISM IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS MORE COMPETITIVE
AND MORE COMPASSIONATE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE RACE AGAIN IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE YOU SHOW ME A CREATURE WITH WEBBED FEET AND GILLS SOMEHOW WATER'S INVOLVED
SOMEONE WITH THAT KIND OF HEART THERE'S SOME KIND OF CONNECTION THERE
AND THE ANSWER TO IT I THINK
CAN BE FOUND DOWN IN THE COPPER CANYONS OF MEXICO
WHERE THERE'S A RECLUSIVE TRIBE CALLED THE TARAHUMARA INDIANS
NOW THE TARAHUMARA ARE REMARKABLE FOR THREE THINGS NUMBER ONE IS THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FOR THE PAST 400 YEARS WHEN THE CONQUISTADORS ARRIVED IN NORTH AMERICA YOU HAD TWO CHOICES YOU EITHER FIGHT BACK AND ENGAGE OR YOU COULD TAKE OFF THE MAYANS AND AZTECS ENGAGED WHICH IS WHY THERE ARE VERY FEW MAYANS AND AZTECS
THE TARAHUMARA HAD A DIFFERENT STRATEGY THEY TOOK OFF AND HID IN THIS
LABYRINTHINE NETWORKING SPIDER WEBBING SYSTEM OF CANYONS CALLED THE COPPER CANYONS AND THERE THEY'VE REMAINED SINCE THE 1600S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WAY THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE SECOND THING REMARKABLE ABOUT THE TARAHUMARA IS DEEP INTO OLD AGE 70 TO 80 YEARS OLD
THESE GUYS AREN'T RUNNING MARATHONS THEY'RE RUNNING MEGA MARATHONS THEY'RE NOT DOING 26 MILES THEY'RE DOING 100 150 MILES AT A TIME
AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT INJURY WITHOUT PROBLEMS
HAS A CHOICE IT'S EITHER GOING TO BREATHE OR IT'S GOING TO COOL OFF BUT IT AIN'T DOING BOTH
WE CAN SO WHAT IF WE EVOLVED AS HUNTING PACK ANIMALS WHAT IF THE ONLY NATURAL ADVANTAGE WE HAD IN THE WORLD
WAS THE FACT THAT WE COULD GET TOGETHER AS A GROUP GO OUT THERE ON THAT AFRICAN SAVANNA
PICK OUT AN ANTELOPE GO OUT AS PACK AND RUN THAT THING TO DEATH
THAT'S ALL WE COULD DO WE COULD RUN REALLY FAR ON A HOT DAY WELL IF THAT'S TRUE A COUPLE OTHER THINGS HAD TO BE TRUE AS WELL THE KEY TO BEING PART OF A HUNTING PACK IS THE WORD PACK IF YOU GO OUT BY YOURSELF AND TRY TO CHASE AN ANTELOPE I GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE TWO CADAVERS OUT IN THE SAVANNA
YOU NEED A PACK TO PULL TOGETHER YOU NEED TO HAVE THOSE 64 AND 65 YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ANTELOPE YOU'RE TRYING TO CATCH THE HERD EXPLODES AND IT GATHERS BACK AGAIN
THOSE EXPERT TRACKERS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE PACK THEY CAN'T BE 10 MILES BEHIND YOU
NEED THE WOMEN AND THE ADOLESCENTS THERE BECAUSE THE TWO TIMES IN YOUR LIFE YOU MOST BENEFIT FROM ANIMAL PROTEIN IS WHEN YOU'RE A NURSING MOTHER AND A DEVELOPING ADOLESCENT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO HAVE THE ANTELOPE OVER THERE DEAD AND THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO EAT IT 50 MILES AWAY THEY NEED TO BE PART OF THE PACK
YOU NEED THOSE 27 YEAR OLD STUDS AT THE PEAK OF THEIR POWERS READY TO DROP THE KILL AND YOU NEED THOSE TEENAGERS WHO ARE LEARNING THE WHOLE THING INVOLVED THE
PACK STAYS TOGETHER
ANOTHER THING THAT HAS TO BE TRUE
THIS PACK CANNOT BE MATERIALISTIC YOU
HUMANS RAN AND RAN ALL THE TIME WE ARE HERE TODAY WE HAVE OUR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ALL OF OUR SCIENCE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT OUR ANCESTORS WERE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY EVERY DAY WHICH WAS JUST RELY ON THEIR NAKED FEET AND LEGS TO RUN LONG DISTANCES SO HOW DO WE GET BACK TO THAT AGAIN WELL I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THE FIRST THING IS
GET RID OF ALL PACKAGING ALL THE SALES ALL THE MARKETING GET RID OF ALL THE STINKING RUNNING SHOES STOP FOCUSING ON URBAN MARATHONS WHICH IF YOU DO
FOUR HOURS YOU SUCK AND IF YOU DO 35959 YOU'RE AWESOME BECAUSE YOU QUALIFIED FOR ANOTHER RACE
WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THAT SENSE OF PLAYFULNESS AND JOYFULNESS AND I WOULD SAY NAKEDNESS THAT HAS MADE THE TARAHUMARA
ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST AND SERENE CULTURES IN OUR TIME
SO WHAT'S THE BENEFIT SO WHAT SO YOU BURN OFF THE H AGEN DAZS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE
BUT MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER BENEFIT THERE AS WELL
WITHOUT GETTING TOO EXTREME ABOUT THIS IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE
EVERYBODY COULD GO OUT THE DOOR AND ENGAGE IN THE KIND OF EXERCISE THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM MORE RELAXED MORE SERENE
MORE HEALTHY
BURN OFF STRESS WHERE YOU DON'T COME BACK INTO YOUR OFFICE A RAGING MANIAC ANYMORE OR GO HOME WITH LOT OF STRESS ON TOP OF YOU AGAIN
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE TODAY AND WHAT THE TARAHUMARA HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I DON'T SAY LET'S GO BACK TO THE COPPER CANYONS AND LIVE
REASON I GET PERSONALLY PISSED OFF ABOUT RUNNING SHOES IS BECAUSE I BOUGHT A MILLION OF THEM AND I KEPT GETTING HURT AND I THINK IF ANYBODY IN HERE RUNS
I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH CAROL WE TALKED FOR TWO MINUTES BACKSTAGE AND SHE TALKED ABOUT PLANTAR FASCIITIS YOU TALK TO A RUNNER I GUARANTEE WITHIN 30 SECONDS THE CONVERSATION TURNS TO INJURY
SO IF HUMANS
EVOLVED AS RUNNERS IF THAT'S OUR ONE NATURAL ADVANTAGE THEN WHY ARE WE SO BAD AT IT WHY DO WE KEEP GETTING HURT A
CURIOUS THING ABOUT RUNNING AND RUNNING INJURIES IS THAT THE RUNNING INJURY IS NEW TO OUR TIME IF YOU READ FOLKLORE AND MYTHOLOGY
ANY KIND OF MYTHS ANY KIND OF TALL TALES RUNNING IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH FREEDOM AND VITALITY AND YOUTHFULNESS AND ETERNAL VIGOR IT'S ONLY IN OUR LIFETIME THAT RUNNING HAS BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH FEAR AND PAIN GERONIMO USED TO SAY MY ONLY FRIENDS ARE MY LEGS I ONLY TRUST MY LEGS THAT'S BECAUSE AN APACHE TRIATHLON USED TO BE YOU'D RUN 50 MILES ACROSS THE DESERT ENGAGE IN HAND TO HAND COMBAT STEAL A BUNCH OF HORSES
YOUR CRAP AROUND TRYING TO CHASE THE ANTELOPE YOU CAN'T BE PISSED OFF PACK YOU CAN'T BE BEARING GRUDGES LIKE I'M NOT CHASING THAT GUY'S ANTELOPE HE PISSED ME OFF LET HIM GO CHASE HIS OWN ANTELOPE THE PACK HAS GOT TO BE ABLE TO SWALLOW ITS
BEEN IN THE OLYMPICS FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW BUT ONE THING THAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT ALL WOMEN SPRINTERS THEY ALL SUCK THEY'RE TERRIBLE THERE'S NOT A FAST WOMAN ON THE PLANET AND THERE NEVER HAS BEEN THE FASTEST WOMAN TO EVER RUN A MILE DID IT IN 415 I COULD THROW A
BRAIN EXPLODED IN SIZE AUSTRALOPITHECUS HAD A TINY LITTLE PEA BRAIN SUDDENLY HUMANS SHOW UP HOMO ERECTUS BIG OLD MELON HEAD
TO HAVE A BRAIN OF THAT SIZE YOU NEED TO HAVE A SOURCE OF CONDENSED CALORIC ENERGY IN OTHER WORDS EARLY HUMANS ARE EATING DEAD ANIMALS NO ARGUMENT THAT'S A FACT
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE FIRST EDGED WEAPONS ONLY APPEARED ABOUT 200000 YEARS AGO SO SOMEHOW FOR NEARLY TWO MILLION YEARS
WE ARE KILLING ANIMALS WITHOUT ANY WEAPONS NOW WE'RE NOT USING OUR STRENGTH BECAUSE WE ARE THE BIGGEST SISSIES IN THE JUNGLE EVERY OTHER ANIMAL IS STRONGER THAN WE ARE THEY HAVE FANGS THEY HAVE CLAWS THEY HAVE NIMBLENESS THEY HAVE SPEED WE THINK USAIN BOLT IS FAST USAIN BOLT CAN GET HIS ASS KICKED BY A SQUIRREL
WE'RE NOT FAST
THAT WOULD BE AN OLYMPIC EVENT TURN A SQUIRREL LOOSE WHOEVER
BASICALLY JUST RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT YEAH I MEAN WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR TWO MILLION YEARS SO IT'S KIND OF ARROGANT
COMPELLING ARGUMENT THAT MAYBE THE TARAHUMARA
ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT ALL OF US HAD DONE FOR TWO MILLION YEARS THAT IT'S US IN MODERN TIMES WHO HAVE SORT OF GONE OFF THE PATH YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT RUNNING AS THIS KIND OF ALIEN FOREIGN THING THIS PUNISHMENT YOU'VE GOT TO DO BECAUSE YOU ATE PIZZA THE NIGHT BEFORE
BUT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT MAYBE WE'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE TAKEN THIS NATURAL ADVANTAGE WE HAD AND WE SPOILED IT
HOW DO WE SPOIL IT WELL HOW DO WE SPOIL ANYTHING
WE TRY TO CASH IN ON IT RIGHT WE TRY TO CAN IT AND PACKAGE IT AND MAKE IT BETTER AND THEN SELL IT TO PEOPLE AND
FASTEST WOMAN MARATHONER IN HISTORY BY FAR ONLY 10 MINUTES OFF THE MEN'S WORLD RECORD PAULA RADCLIFFE IS ESSENTIALLY UNBEATABLE
THAT'S HER COMPETITION
THE GUN GOES OFF AND I MEAN SHE'S NOT EVEN AN UNDERDOG SHE'S LIKE UNDER THE UNDERDOGS
BUT THE UNDER UNDERDOG HANGS TOUGH AND 22 MILES INTO A 26 MILE RACE THERE IS DERARTU TULU UP THERE WITH THE LEAD PACK
NOW THIS IS WHEN SOMETHING REALLY BIZARRE HAPPENS
PAULA RADCLIFFE THE ONE PERSON WHO IS SURE TO SNATCH THE BIG PAYCHECK FROM DERARTU TULU'S UNDER UNDERDOG HANDS
SUDDENLY GRABS HER LEG AND STARTS TO FALL BACK
SO WE ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT YOU GIVE HER A QUICK CRACK IN THE TEETH WITH YOUR ELBOW AND
BLAZE FOR THE FINISH LINE
DERARTU TULU
RUINS THE SCRIPT INSTEAD OF TAKING OFF SHE FALLS BACK AND SHE GRABS PAULA RADCLIFFE AND SAYS COME ON
COME WITH US YOU CAN DO IT SO PAULA RADCLIFFE UNFORTUNATELY
DOES IT SHE CATCHES UP WITH THE LEAD PACK AND IS
AND MAIZE WHICH IS THE TARAHUMARA'S PREFERRED DIET
BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN
AND IF WE FIND THAT THING MAYBE THERE IS A BIG FAT NOBEL PRIZE OUT THERE BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY COULD FIND A WAY
TO RESTORE THAT NATURAL ABILITY THAT WE ALL ENJOYED FOR MOST OF OUR EXISTENCE UP UNTIL THE 1970S OR SO
THE BENEFITS SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL AND POLITICAL AND MENTAL COULD BE ASTOUNDING
WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEING TODAY IS THERE IS A GROWING SUBCULTURE OF BAREFOOT RUNNERS PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN RID OF THEIR SHOES AND WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND UNIFORMLY IS YOU GET RID OF THE SHOES YOU GET RID OF THE STRESS YOU GET RID OF THE INJURIES AND THE AILMENTS AND WHAT YOU FIND IS SOMETHING THE TARAHUMARA HAVE KNOWN FOR VERY LONG TIME THAT THIS CAN BE WHOLE LOT OF FUN
A HIGH SCHOOL BOY WHO CAN RUN FASTER THAN 415 FOR SOME REASON YOU GUYS ARE JUST REALLY SLOW
BUT
BUT YOU GET TO THE MARATHON WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU'VE ONLY BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN THE MARATHON FOR 20 YEARS BECAUSE PRIOR TO THE 1980S
MEDICAL SCIENCE SAID IF A WOMAN TRIED TO RUN 26 MILES DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU TRIED TO RUN 26 MILES
WHY YOU WERE BANNED FROM THE MARATHON BEFORE THE 1980S AUDIENCE MEMBER HER UTERUS WOULD BE TORN CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL HER UTERUS WOULD BE TORN YES TORN REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS THE
WOMAN NAMED DERARTU TULU TURNS UP AT THE STARTING LINE SHE'S 37 YEARS OLD SHE HASN'T WON A MARATHON OF ANY KIND IN EIGHT YEARS AND FEW MONTHS PREVIOUSLY SHE HAD ALMOST DIED IN
THOUSANDS AND EVEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WE COULD NO LONGER REMEMBER EVERYONE THAT WE INTERACTED WITH THERE WAS THE RISE OF ANONYMITY AND ANONYMITY THREATENED THE SOCIAL ORDER
WHICH WAS ON SMALL SCALE TO A DECENTRALIZED SOCIETY OF OUR FUTURE WHICH ALLOWS MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO LIVE TOGETHER
TO COME TO LEGAL AGREEMENTS TO BUILD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO TRADE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM THIRD
PRESS WAS ONLY THE FIRST OF A LONG SERIES OF TECHNOLOGIES THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH ARE THE INTERNET AND BITCOIN
INSPIRED THE FIRST DEMOCRACY MOVEMENTS PEOPLE STARTED CHALLENGING THE STATE STARTED CHALLENGING THE CHURCH DEVELOPED THEIR OWN IDEAS ABOUT HOW THEY COULD DO THINGS
THEN WE PRODUCE WHAT WE'VE AGREED TO COOPERATE ON AND FINALLY WE TRADE THE GOODS AND SERVICES THAT WE'VE PRODUCED
10000 YEARS OF CENTRALIZED SOCIETY WHICH IS REALLY ALL THAT WE REMEMBER IS ACTUALLY JUST A BLIP IN TIME
TECHNOLOGY BASED SYSTEMS SCALE VIRTUALLY WITHOUT LIMIT BEYOND DUNBAR'S NUMBER SO WE CAN ONCE AGAIN LIVE TOGETHER IN A DECENTRALIZED WAY BUT ON A LARGE SCALE
DESPERATELY NEED JOBS THEY DESPERATELY NEED WEALTH CREATION SO THESE ARE VERY EXCITING
LIMITS HIS ABILITY TO GENERATE WEALTH BUT
ALLOW PEOPLE TO CREATE JOBS AND GENERATE WEALTH ON SCALE THAT HASN'T BEEN POSSIBLE IN TODAY'S WORLD
WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
AND DECENTRALIZED COMMUNICATIONS HAS TWO ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS
IN THE MODERN WORLD
THE INTERNET
AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
THE
INTERNET AND PEER TO PEER DECENTRALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS BITTORRENT
ARE NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE WITHOUT CENSORSHIP
SO CENTRALIZED POWER STRUCTURES CAN NO LONGER CONTROL THE FLOW OF INFORMATION
HOWEVER THE INTERNET BY ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH
WE NEED CRYPTOGRAPHY
BECAUSE WITHOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY
THE CENTRALIZED STRUCTURES CAN STILL USE SURVEILLANCE
AND CENSORSHIP OF WHAT WE COMMUNICATE
AND THIS IMPACTS OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH OUR FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
TO HAVE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF ACTION
WE NEED PRIVACY ENABLED
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
SO THE INTERNET PLUS CRYPTOGRAPHY GIVES
THAT WILL
ALLOW PEOPLE TO PRODUCE THEIR ENERGY CHEAPLY AT HOME
AT VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED QUANTITIES
AND TOGETHER
THESE WILL MOVE US FROM THE SYSTEMS WE'VE HAD LIKE THE DIET DAYS OF THE PHARAOH ONE GUY CONTROLLING AN ARMY OF THOUSANDS OF SLAVES
TODAY WE'VE GOT APPLE
HAVING FACTORIES IN CHINA WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS
THIS WILL MOVE US TO MUCH SMALLER SYSTEMS WHERE PEOPLE CAN
PRODUCE THEIR OWN GOODS AND SERVICES AT HOME WITHOUT
LIMIT SO IT'S THE EMERGENCE OF TECHNOLOGY BASED TRUST SYSTEMS THAT ALLOWED US TO ORGANIZE SOCIETY ON A LARGE SCALE WITHOUT CENTRALIZATION
EVERYONE IS GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE WORLD'S KNOWLEDGE TECHNOLOGIES AND
THAT ALLOWED US TO AGAIN LIVE TOGETHER IN A DECENTRALIZED WAY WITHOUT THOSE CENTRALIZED STRUCTURES WHAT IS IT THAT ALLOWED US TO BRIDGE AND TRANSCEND DUNBAR'S NUMBER
SERVICES AND THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD HE IS CUT OFF FROM THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
70 PEOPLE EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY AND IT WAS HARD TO GET AWAY WITH DOING BAD THINGS
ARE GOING TO BE RAISED OUT OF POVERTY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING
SO FIRST WE COMMUNICATE ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO
AND THEN WE COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON
HOW WE WANT TO COOPERATE
AND FOR THAT WE NEED DECENTRALIZED LAW
THE THREE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A DECENTRALIZED LEGAL SYSTEM ARE
CHOICE OF LAW
CHOICE OF ADJUDICATOR
AND CHOICE OF ENFORCER
CHOICE OF LAW MEANS THAT WE CAN CHOOSE THE LAW THAT APPLIES TO OUR AGREEMENTS IN OUR INTERACTIONS
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE DO A CONTRACT AND WE CAN CHOOSE
THE LAW OF ENGLAND
OR THE LAW OF SWITZERLAND
OR WE CAN EVEN MAKE UP OUR OWN LAW
CHOICE OF ADJUDICATOR MEANS WE CAN CHOOSE
WHO HEARS OUR DISPUTES WHO RESOLVES OUR DISPUTES
AND FINALLY CHOICE OF ENFORCER MEANS
WE CAN CHOOSE WHO IT IS THAT ENFORCES OUR CONTRACTS AND LEGAL JUDGMENTS
THESE
THREE PRINCIPLES SOUND LIKE VERY RADICAL IDEAS
BUT IT MAY SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR THAT THESE ARE ACTUALLY NOT UNTESTED THEORIES
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL WAY THAT OUR LEGAL SYSTEMS OPERATED THESE IDEAS DATE FROM PREHISTORY
THESE WERE THE CORNERSTONES OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF OUR PAST
IT'S ONLY IN THE PAST 10000 YEARS OF INCREASINGLY CENTRALIZED SOCIETIES AND INCREASINGLY CENTRALIZED LEGAL SYSTEMS
THAT WE'VE GRADUALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT
THESE BUILDING BLOCKS
AND TODAY IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO IMAGINE HOW WE COULD HAVE A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT'S DECENTRALIZED IN THE WAY THAT I'VE JUST DESCRIBED
IT'S TIME TO BRING BACK THESE IDEAS
AND TO REINTRODUCE THEM INTO THE MODERN WORLD SO THAT WE CAN REALLY OPERATE A DECENTRALIZED SOCIETY
I AND OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVELOPED A COMPLETE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
FOR DECENTRALIZED SOCIETY THAT OPERATES ON THESE PRINCIPLES
AND IN FACT
WE'RE ALREADY IMPLEMENTING THESE PRINCIPLES AND THESE LEGAL SYSTEMS IN OUR BUSINESSES
AND IN SO CALLED STARTUP CITIES
FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLES OF HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE
THERE ARE NOW ENTREPRENEURS BUILDING
SO CALLED STARTUP CITIES
IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AUTONOMOUS REGIONS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAT DESPERATELY NEED JOBS
TO LIVE LIVES OF OUR OWN CHOOSING IN PEACE FREEDOM
ON LARGE SCALE SO PEOPLE PUT UP WITH THESE ABUSES FOR 10000 YEARS THE ENTIRE SPAN OF RECORDED HISTORY
GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO CONFISCATE 40 OF THEIR ASSETS AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT BUT WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES YOU HAVE THE POWER BACK IN YOUR OWN HANDS
JUST LIKE WE'VE HAD WITH DECENTRALIZED COMMUNICATIONS
DECENTRALIZED PRODUCTION ALLOWS US TO BYPASS THE CENSORSHIP OF CENTRALIZED SYSTEMS AND THERE ARE TWO ESSENTIAL
ELEMENTS OF DECENTRALIZED PRODUCTION
THE FIRST OF ALL DECENTRALIZED MATERIALS PRODUCTION AND SECONDLY DECENTRALIZED ENERGY PRODUCTION
DECENTRALIZED MATERIALS PRODUCTION INCLUDES TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS 3D PRINTING
WITH 3D PRINTING
ANYONE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD CAN DOWNLOAD A DESIGN FROM THE INTERNET
AND PRINT THIS OUT AT HOME PRINT OUT THEIR OWN PRODUCTS
SO THIS BYPASSES THE RESTRICTIONS THAT SEEK CONTROL OF THE FLOW OF GOODS ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES
TO CHANGE THEY WILL HAVE TO BECOME COMPETING SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT SERVE THE NEEDS OF ALL OF US
THAT MOBILE PHONE
HE CAN START WITH A BUSINESS IDEA
AND WITHIN MINUTES WITH A FEW CLICKS ON HIS MOBILE PHONE
HE CAN INCORPORATE A LEGAL ENTITY
AND HE CONNECTS TO A GLOBAL TRANSACTION PLATFORM
THAT ALLOWS HIM TO SAFELY AND SECURELY DO BUSINESS WITH ANYONE IN THE WORLD INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT HE'S NEVER MET
PEOPLE THAT HE CANNOT TRUST
AND THE TRANSACTIONS THE INTEGRITY OF THE TRANSACTIONS IS GUARANTEED BY THE TECHNOLOGY
AND THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A DECENTRALIZED FINANCIAL SYSTEM ARE
FIRST A DECENTRALIZED CURRENCY
AND SECONDLY DECENTRALIZED CONTRACTING SYSTEMS
THE INVENTION OF BITCOIN IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGHS IN HUMAN HISTORY
FOR THE FIRST TIME
WE HAVE A DECENTRALIZED CURRENCY THAT CANNOT BE CENSORED
THAT CANNOT BE CONTROLLED BY ANY ENTITY BY ANY GOVERNMENT
THE INVENTION OF BITCOIN HAS SPARKED THE EMERGENCE OF WHOLE NEW DIGITAL FINANCE INDUSTRY THAT IS BUILDING AN ECOSYSTEM AROUND BITCOIN THAT WILL DEVELOP DIGITAL FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE
IS DECENTRALIZED CONTRACTING SYSTEMS
THESE CONTRACTING SYSTEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME OFFER A COMPLETE UNIVERSAL TRANSACTION PLATFORM
SO ON A SINGLE INTEGRATED PLATFORM YOU CAN DO LITERALLY ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL OR LEGAL TRANSACTION
AND THESE TWO TECHNOLOGIES PUT TOGETHER SO DECENTRALIZED CURRENCY WITH DECENTRALIZED CONTRACTING PLATFORMS
GIVE POWER TO ORDINARY PEOPLE
TODAY'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS HIGHLY CENTRALIZED A FEW PEOPLE PULL THE LEVERS OF POWER AND WE ARE AT THEIR MERCY
A STARK EXAMPLE OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE IS
CYPRUS
PRESS HAS NO MEMORY LIMIT
AND THE ECONOMICS OF PRINTING ALLOWED ORDINARY PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
TO CHEAPLY RECORD AND COMMUNICATE IDEAS ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD
FREE FROM THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE CENTRALIZED STATE AND THE CENTRALIZED CHURCH
THIS KEPT THE SOCIAL ORDER BUT WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT ABUSE SO THE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE MIDDLE EAST HERE'S A SERIOUS ISSUE WHEN WE SEE EACH OTHER WHEN WE SAY HELLO HOW MANY KISSES ARE WE GOING TO
WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING I ENDED UP ON A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE ONE GUY WROTE ANOTHER GUY HE SAID I NEVER KNEW THESE PEOPLE LAUGHED THINK ABOUT IT YOU NEVER SEE US LAUGHING IN AMERICAN FILM OR TELEVISION RIGHT MAYBE LIKE AN EVIL
YOU KNOW AND IT'S AMAZING AND IT HELPS CHANGE THE IMAGE OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE WEST A LOT OF AMERICANS DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT US ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST I'M IRANIAN AND AMERICAN I'M THERE I KNOW I'VE TRAVELED HERE THERE'S SO MUCH WE LAUGH
RIGHT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WE LAUGH WHEN I DID THE AXIS OF EVIL COMEDY
MISUNDERSTANDING AND STEREOTYPES FROM HAPPENING FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS A LITTLE WHILE AGO IN THE US THERE WAS A MUSLIM FAMILY WALKING DOWN THE AISLE OF AN AIRPLANE TALKING ABOUT THE SAFEST PLACE TO SIT ON THE PLANE
SOME PASSENGERS OVERHEARD THEM SOMEHOW MISCONSTRUED THAT AS TERRORIST TALK
GOT THEM KICKED OFF THE PLANE IT
WAS A FAMILY A MOTHER FATHER CHILD TALKING ABOUT THE SEATING AS A MIDDLE
LIKE TO LAUGH WE LIKE TO CELEBRATE LIFE AND I WISH MORE AMERICANS WOULD TRAVEL HERE I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE MY FRIENDS TRAVEL SEE THE MIDDLE EAST THERE'S SO MUCH TO SEE SO MANY
PLACE IT FEELS LIKE THE UNITED
EXPLAINED TO ME BEFORE THE 79 REVOLUTION IT WAS TWO {LG} AFTER THE REVOLUTION THREE SO WITH IRANIANS YOU CAN TELL WHOSE SIDE THE PERSON IS ON BASED ON THE NUMBER OF KISSES THEY GIVE YOU YEAH IF YOU GO
YOU GUYS DO THE NOSE TO NOSE WHY IS THAT ARE YOU TOO TIRED TO GO ALL THE WAY AROUND
IN FAT CHANCES AND LONG SHOTS
AND UNDERDOGS
AND
I VERY MUCH TO BELIEVED IN MYSELF
AND THE IDEA THAT IF I WORKED HARD ENOUGH I COULD MAKE ANYTHING POSSIBLE
SO TO ME THOSE WORDS WERE MORE THAN JUST INSPIRATIONAL IT WAS A LICENSE TO MOVE MOUNTAINS AND
I NEVER FORGOT THAT AND TO THIS DAY I STILL TAKE THOSE WORDS VERY MUCH TO HEART
AND WHEN PEOPLE WOULD SEE ONLY A SLIM CHANCE I WAS FOCUSED ON POSSIBILITY
SO
GAVE ME A LOT OF COMPETENT IT ALSO LED ME TO WORRIED A LOT
I COULDN'T HANDLE IT ON MY OWN THAT'S ABOUT IT DOT I
WENT TO GET SOME HELP
I FOUND MYSELF IN EIGHT FARE CUTS OFF IT
WHERE I WAS
QUICKLY TOLD
THAT MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY STILL HAS TO BE HERE THAT GREEN INTO DIRAC EVERYTHING LEAVE THIRTY HOUR LEAVE TOWN WE DEFEAT
AND TECH MYSELF INTO LONG TERM CARE CLINIC
AND
I WAS
BARELY
COMPULSIVE DISORDER JESS SETUP ON MY DOORSTEP AND BARS RIGHT INTO MY LIFE QUITE WITHOUT PERMISSION I WILL
AND FIGHTING AGAINST HIM SO IT REALLY TAKES COMMITMENT ONGOING LIFELONG COMMITMENT AND
HOW DOES SO MUCH POWER
IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL BUT WHAT WE BELIEVE ANY AND WHERE THEIR BELIEFS ARLENE S
DO
MORE HARM
BEEN GOOD
MIND BELIEF
DEGRADING
BUT I THINK THEY ARE BAD ELEVEN RIGHT
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG I KNEW THAT WHATEVER I WAS FEELING AND THINKING IT WOULD NOT NORMAL AND
I KNOW THAT IT WOULD COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL
THAT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE GUESS WHAT
THERE WAS NOT POST ARE ON THE WALL WE REALLY NEED THAT TAKING WITH POSSIBLE
AND SO
I SCRAPPED
AND
AND I WAITED I'M OUT OF SCHOOL BUT I WOULD FIT CERTAIN CLASSES
I ACTUALLY SKIPPED RESPECT ONE OF THE KID WHO SKIPPED RESPECT
ANIME LOVES FIELD TRIP
BUT I WOULD STAY HOME SICK ON FIELDTRIP DAVE
ALL IN AN EFFORT TO JUST
KEEP MYSELF SAFE SO I THOUGHT AND IT'S REALLY TOO AVOID ANYTHING THAT MIGHT TRIGGER YET ANOTHER ANXIETY ATTACK
WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE LEAVING MY
WHY IS IT REALLY HURT
AND THAT CLEAN
THINGS CHANGED
AND SUDDENLY
I HAD OPTION
OXEN'S I COULD IT BE BEFORE
THAT INCLUDED
FINDING IN DIFFERENT MARKET
RIGHT
FINANCIALLY AND STARTED SKIPPING OUT ON ALL KINDS OF THINGS GIVING OUT ON
THAT SURENDER
EVERYTHING ALF
DOT WORKS
NOW RESEARCH SENATE THAT THE MORE STRONGLY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING
THE MORE WE TEND TO OVERLOOKED ANYTHING THAT LIVE OUT FINE ABOUT BELIEVER ANYTHING THAT CONTRADICTS THAT THE WEEK
FAIR QUESTION
YOU CHALLENGE
YOURSELF
AND URIBL WEEK AND INSTEAD ONLY FOCUSING ON THINGS THAT CONFIRM THEM YOU
HAVE TO TRAIN YOURSELF COURT EVEN FORCE YOURSELF TO WIDEN YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND ACTIVELY SEEK OUT
AND HE JUST WENT ON AND I'M LIKE THAT AND THEN I'D HAVE TO WATCH US MIGHT RELENTED ONLY TEN POSSIBILITY HAVE BECOME START
IN EVERYTHING AND HOW IT CAN ALL POSSIBLY GO ROTTEN
AND ONE GAME
RANGE
I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD
I SUDDENLY STARTED WORRYING
MY
HANDS WERE DIRTY AND I NEEDED TO WATCH THEM
ABOARD A NARROWER AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ALL THE TIME
AND IF I EVEN TRIED TO THINK ABOUT
NOT
DEEP BREATH AND WE DID THAT LEVEL BOTH CD PATIENT I Y INTO MY FOCUS TO GET SOME PERSPECTIVE IN REBALANCE ME THINKING AND THAT'S WHAT I REALIZED THERAPIST
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE HAD A COLLECTION AT MOTIVATIONAL POSTERS THAT HUNG AROUND THE WALLS IN THE CLASSROOM
AND ONE OF A FAVORITE ONES SAID ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
IF ONLY YOU BELIEVE
AND THE WORD BELIVE WAS WRITTEN IN ITALIC SO YOU KNEW IT WAS A REALLY SERIOUS RIGHT
IT IS NOT COMPETENT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE REXX
AND LIKE ALIKE AT THE END OF OUR RESPECTIVE TUNNEL
IT GAVE US A STRENGTH TO KEEP GOING WHEN WE HAVE
EVERY EXCUSE TO QUIT
OUR BELIEF
POWERFUL
THEY'RE STILL POWERFUL THAT THEY CAN LITERALLY BE CALM
OUR REALITIES
COM BALANCING YOUR THINKING
FELT COULD THAT TRIP THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE TURN OUT TO BE A DISASTER
ABSOLUTELY AIDID BUT
WHAT IF IT'S NOT A DISASTER
WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY FUN WHEN YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW ABOUT YOURSELF FOR THE WORLD
BLACKED OUT WELCOME OTHER TRAITS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN BEFORE I MEAN
FROM IN SOME OF THEM TURNED OUT PRETTY GREAT
INTERNET ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THIS TRIP COULD BE GREAT TO KNOW NEARLY ONE IN THE BATHROOM NOTE
THOUGH WITHIN YOUR THINKING TEN
SOMETHING THE
EVEN YOUR SAID THAN DONE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE HAVING TO BATTLE AGAINST CD IN YOUR OWN MURAL
SO SOME DAYS I HAVE THE UPPER HAND IN SUNDAY'S ALLY DOUBT BEGAN EVENT THAT MOST OF YOU DON'T HAVE A CD
AND THAT'S WHAT I BEGAN TO CLIMB OUT OF THIS WHOLE THAT I HAD BEEN IN FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE YEAR REALLY
AND I'D BEGIN TO PUT MY LIFE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN
NOT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS FOR SARAH WARE OUR BELIEFS COME FROM OR HOW OUR BRAINS DECIDE WHAT THE REALITY LET'S NOT
BUT I BELIEVE
IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO CONSCIOUSLY
ARLENE
THE BELIEF THAT WE HAVE TO OVER HER BELIEF
RATHER THAN LETTING OUR BELIEF
BUT YOU COULDN'T SEE BEFORE ACQUIRED THAT YOU SIMPLY REFUSED SHE WOULD NOT
OFTEN ENOUGH FOR WELL ENOUGH FOR AND PRECISELY THE RIGHT WAY ANY NUMBER OF HORRIBLE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN
SHE TELLS HIM THAT HIS CHANCES OF RELATIONSHIP WITH HER ARE LIKE
ONE IN A
MILLION
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING DEVASTATED
HE SAYS
SO YOU'RE SEEING THERE'S A CHANCE
RIGHT
AND MY BELIEF IN MY PERSONAL LIFE MY BELIEF TEN HAD LITERALLY TAKEN ME ALL AROUND THE WORLD
AND THAT LED TO ALL KIND OF REALLY EXCITING ADVENTURES LIKE OWNING MY OWN BUSINESS AND BECOMING A PUBLISHED AUTHOR AND MORE RECENTLY ATLANTIC COMPLETING A THIRTY TWO HUNDRED MILEM BICYCLE RIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALL THE WAY FROM
SHE TOLD ME A STORY THAT HELPED ME TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY
THE BAG WERE PADS
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS SO EMBARRASSING AND PAINFUL FOR ME THAT MONTHS LATER WHEN I RAN OUT
I NEEDED MORE I JUST WAS NOT GOING TO APPROACH THAT CONVERSATION WITH HER AGAIN BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GET ANY AND I WANTED TO TRY TAMPONS ANYWAY CAUSE I SWAM ALL THE TIME
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT SO I FIGURED WELL I HAVE A BIKE
NOW I WASN'T ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD I MEAN WE LIVED IN THE SUBURBS FAR AWAY FROM ANY STORES I ONLY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DRIVING LIKE A BLOCK OR TWO ON MY BIKE TO
I ALSO THINK THAT THE WAY WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO CHANGE IS BROKEN
IF WE SIT AROUND WAITING FOR POLITICIANS AND SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND PARENTS TO CHANGE THIS FOR US WE'RE GONNA BE WAITING FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE MOST OF THESE PEOPLE NEVER GOT MUCH TRAINING IN SEXUALITY EDUCATION OR COMFORT IN THEIR HOMES THEMSELVES
SO MY IDEA IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE ONE BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A COMMITMENT FOR A LOT OF US TO SORT OF PUT THIS INTO PRACTICE TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND DO IT CIVICAL WHICH IS
SEASON WAS PARTICULARLY PAINFUL FOR ME TO HEAR PHRASES LIKE LEGITIMATE RAPE
RAPE SHUTDOWN MECHANISMS AND THE QUOTE SOME GIRLS THEY RAPE SO EASY
WHEN SEX IS TREATED AS ABNORMAL
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S TRUE ABOUT SEX BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT A FEW YEARS AGO OUR RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT 30 OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES REPORTED SOME DEGREE OF PAIN
WHEN THEY HAD SEX
THE EDITOR OF ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED NEWSPAPERS IN THE COUNTRY REFUSED TO LET HER WRITER COVER THIS STORY BECAUSE SHE SAID IF THAT WAS TRUE WE WOULD KNOW BECAUSE WOMEN WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THIS
GRANDPARENTS I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL THEM SO I HAD TO CALL MY MOM BECAUSE I NEEDED HELP WHEN SHE CAME HOME FROM WORK SHE CAME BACK WITH A BROWN PAPER GROCERY STORE BAG AND
OF SEXUALITY
IT IS A NORMAL PART OF LIFE I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND MAKE IT NORMAL
NOW I HAVE A PROFESSIONAL STAKE IN THIS FOR SURE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IF WE MAKE IT NORMAL IF WE HELP PEOPLE TO BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE
THAT PEOPLE WILL MORE EASILY REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULTS AND RAPES THEY'LL MORE EASILY TALK ABOUT STIS AND STI TESTING THEY'LL MORE EASILY TALK ABOUT LOVE INTIMACY AND CONNECTION WITH THEIR PARTNERS
BUT I ALSO HAVE A PERSONAL STAKE IN THIS AND THIS IS THAT LIKE MANY OF YOU I KNOW THE SADNESS AND PAIN AND FRUSTRATION OF RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS WHEN TWO PEOPLE CAN'T TALK ABOUT SEX
I ALSO KNOW THE JOYS AND THE INTIMACY AND THE PLEASURE THAT COMES
WITH RELATIONSHIPS WHEN TWO PEOPLE CAN TALK ABOUT SEX
THE OTHER PERSONAL STAKE FOR ME IS THAT WHEN I THINK OF 13 YEAR OLD GIRLS RIDING BIKES
RATHER THAN THINKING OF THEM
SECRETLY BUYING TAMPONS CROSSING BUSY STREETS DISOBEYING THEIR PARENTS
I WISH FOR THEM A WORLD IN WHICH THEY'RE RIDING THEIR BIKES TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE
FEELING THE FREEDOM THAT COMES WITH BEING YOUNG AND OUT ON YOUR OWN
BECAUSE FOR THEM THEY WILL BE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE SEX AND BODIES AND PERIODS AND PUBERTY ARE TOTALLY NORMAL BECAUSE ALL OF YOU AND I MADE IT NORMAL
THANK YOU
BECAUSE THIS IS SO UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THEM IT'S NOT THE ONLY BAD OUTCOME OF A SOCIETY THAT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT SEX WHEN SEX IS TREATED AS ABNORMAL
DOCTORS AND PATIENTS DON'T TALK ABOUT SEX IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR CANCER PATIENTS IN MY LINE OF WORK TO TELL ME THAT THEY'VE HAD 50 OR 100 OR MORE MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS INCLUDING FOR PELVIC RADIATION AND NEVER ONCE HAD A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER MENTION THE SERIOUS SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS TO THEM
WHEN SEX IS TREATED AS ABNORMAL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT OR TEACH ABOUT IT IN SCHOOLS
ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT BUT I GOT THE TAMPONS PUT THE PLASTIC BAG ON MY HANDLEBARS AND RODE BACK THE FIVE MILES AND NEVER TOLD ANYONE EVER MY MOM WILL FIND OUT WHEN SHE HEARS THIS TALK {LG}
BUT WHEN I FIRST ACCEPTED A JOB IN 1999 AT THE KINSEY INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN SEX GENDER
AND REPRODUCTION
I WAS REALLY NERVOUS TO TELL MY FAMILY
THAT I WOULD BE WORKING IN SEX RESEARCH
I WAS PARTICULARLY NERVOUS TO TELL MY GRANDMOTHER
MY GRANDPARENTS LIVED AROUND THE CORNER
FROM MY FAMILY AND I GROWING UP AND I WAS REALLY CLOSE WITH
MAYBE THIS WAS YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WAS BEFORE KINSEY'S TIME THAT WAS BEFORE THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION THESE THINGS WEREN'T TALKED ABOUT BUT AS A RESULT SHE THOUGHT THAT KINSEY'S PIONEERING WORK IN SEX AND REPRODUCTION WAS SO VALUABLE THAT'S WHY SHE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT THAT I WAS WORKING THERE
NOW SHE TRIED TO DO BETTER WITH HER DAUGHTER MY MOM BY GIVING HER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
BUT STILL THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT SEX AND BODIES THAT WAS THE HOME MY MOM WAS RAISED IN SO THAT'S STILL HOW MY MOM FELT ABOUT THOSE THINGS
AND WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR ME TO BE IN FIFTH GRADE AND MY CLASS WAS SHOWN A VIDEO ABOUT PUBERTY THAT I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN TOO
SHE ASKED ME IN THE CAR ON THE WAY TO DANCE CLASS DID THEY SHOW YOU THE VIDEO IN SCHOOL AND I
IN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY KNOWN FOR LACK OF SEX EDUCATION NOTICE THE
VAGINA ALTHOUGH SHE DIDN'T USE THE WORD VAGINA WHEN SHE TOLD ME THIS STORY SO THIS WAS AN AWFUL AND FRIGHTENING BIRTH EXPERIENCE THAT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL AND SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO FOR YEARS
CAME BACK TO US ABOUT A DECADE LATER AND THIS TIME WITH A DIRECTOR NAMED DAVID FINCHER NOW FINCHER IS AN
GENERATED VERSION OF BRAD'S HEAD AGED TO APPEAR AS BENJAMIN AND ATTACH THAT TO THE BODY OF THE REAL ACTOR SOUNDED GREAT OF
AND THE SAUCE WAS CODE IN SOFTWARE THAT WE'D WRITTEN TO ALLOW THESE DISPARATE PIECES OF TECHNOLOGY TO COME TOGETHER
EFFECTS FILM IT HAS TO BE A MAN WE REALLY FELT LIKE WE WERE IN A KIND OF A 12 STEP PROGRAM
CAN REMEMBER ACTUALLY WHEN I GOT THE PHONE CALL TO CONGRATULATE US TO SAY THE MOVIE WAS A GO I ACTUALLY THREW UP
IMAGING THE VIDEO GAME SPACE AND RE APPROPRIATE THEM AND WE HAD TO CREATE KIND OF
DEEPLY INTO BRAD'S FACE TO BRING THE AGING TO THIS CHARACTER HE NEEDED TO BE A VERY SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER SO
PASSION TO WILL THE PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGY INTO EXISTENCE SO WHEN YOU'RE FACED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT
ALL AT THE SAME TIME BUT HE HAD TO YOU KNOW DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THE WORK HAD TO HOLD UP FOR ALMOST THE FIRST HOUR OF THE MOVIE WE DID ABOUT 325 SHOTS SO WE
RACE CULTURE GENDER SO THIS BECAME THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RESEARCH AS WE WENT FORWARD AND THEN WE CAME ACROSS SOME REMARKABLE
TO WALK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AT NIGHTTIME UNDER CANDLELIGHT HE HAD TO HOLD AN EXTREME CLOSE UP HE HAD TO DELIVER DIALOGUE HE HAD TO BE ABLE TO RUN HE HAD TO BE ABLE TO SWEAT HE HAD TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A BATH TO CRY HE EVEN HAD TO THROW UP
TO MAKE BRAD LOOK A LOT OLDER NEEDED TO AGE HIM 45 YEARS OR SO AND WE
THAT THERE WAS A GIANT CHASM BETWEEN THE STATE OF THE ART OF
US TO DO A SCREEN TEST OF BENJAMIN AND WE DID IT IN ABOUT FIVE WEEKS BUT WE USED LOTS OF CHEATS AND SHORTCUTS WE BASICALLY PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER TO GET THROUGH THE MEETING
CAPABLE OF DOING NOW THAT'S GREAT EXCEPT WE HAD HIM AT AGE
THIS WAS THE HOLY GRAIL OF OUR INDUSTRY AND THE FACT THAT THIS GUY
POSES OR SHAPES OF THE HUMAN FACE AND THAT THOSE BASIC POSES OR SHAPES OF THE FACE CAN
WAY THEY CREATED A BREAKTHROUGH IN COMPUTER VISUALIZATION SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CLIP OF THE FILM NOW HOPEFULLY IT WON'T STUTTER AND IF WE DID OUR JOBS WELL YOU WON'T KNOW THAT WE WERE EVEN INVOLVED {NS}
WAS WHEN WE HAD OUR AHA THIS WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH THIS IS WHEN WE'RE LIKE OK WE'RE GOING TO BE OK THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK AND THE AHA WAS WHAT IF WE COULD TAKE
THE EDGES OFF OF THE PERFORMANCE AND THING OUR PROCESS AND THE TECHNOLOGY COULDN'T DO IS THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND INTENT THE INTENT OF THE ACTOR SO IT SEES A SMILE AS A SMILE IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE AN IRONIC SMILE OR A HAPPY SMILE OR A FRUSTRATED SMILE SO IT DID TAKE HUMANS TO KIND
NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD TAKE BRAD'S IDIOSYNCRASIES HIS LITTLE TICS THE LITTLE SUBTLETIES THAT MAKE HIM WHO HE IS AND HAVE THAT
FRAME 14 THE LEFT EYEBROW BEGINS TO MOVE FROM HERE TO HERE AND IT CONCLUDES MOVING IN FRAME 32 AND SO WE COULD
FRAME BY FRAME BASIS WE COULD ACTUALLY RECONSTRUCT A 3D HEAD THAT EXACTLY MATCHED THE PERFORMANCE
OFF FROM ACTOR TO ACTOR WE EVEN RULED OUT THE IDEA OF USING MAKEUP WE REALIZED THAT PROSTHETIC MAKEUP
THE SUBTLETIES OF THE SKIN WE NEEDED TO SEE SKIN MOVING OVER MUSCLE MOVING OVER BONE WE NEEDED CREASES AND DIMPLES AND WRINKLES AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS OUR
A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW BENJAMIN TO DO EVERYTHING A HUMAN BEING CAN DO
SCANNED INTO THE COMPUTER AT VERY HIGH RESOLUTION ENORMOUS POLYGONAL COUNT AND SO NOW WE HAD THREE AGE INCREMENTS OF BENJAMIN IN THE COMPUTER BUT WE NEEDED TO GET A DATABASE OF HIM DOING MORE THAN
BY FRAME RECONSTRUCT THE GEOMETRY OF EXACTLY WHAT THE SUBJECT'S DOING AT THE MOMENT SO EFFECTIVELY YOU GET 3D DATA IN REAL TIME OF THE SUBJECT
IN 2004 AND WHERE WE NEEDED IT TO BE SO WE FOCUSED ON MOTION CAPTURE
MANY YEARS OF STARTS AND STOPS ON THIS PROJECT AND MAKING THAT TOUGH DECISION THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO GREENLIGHT THE MOVIE
LIKE WE DO IN THE VISUAL EFFECTS INDUSTRY THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME
THAT BRAD PITT COULD OPERATE WITH HIS OWN FACE THERE WERE NO ANIMATORS NECESSARY TO COME IN AND INTERPRET BEHAVIOR OR ENHANCE HIS PERFORMANCE
ONE HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE US HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU YOU
MINE TO BE MINDFUL THAT PROCESS OF TURNING AND PUSHING BACK FROM THE INJUSTICE BETWEEN
DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS CHANGED THE WAY WE THOUGHT ABOUT OURSELVES AND HOW WE TREATED OTHER PEOPLE FROM HISTORY BOOKS TO ALLEGORIES AND HOOKS WE TEND TO REPRESENT OURSELVES BY THREE IMPORTANT POINTS OF THOUGHT
STYLE AND SLANG IT'S PART OF MY CULTURE SO HOW CAN THEY TELL ME TO CHANGE IF THEY CLAIM THE MULTICULTURAL
FRICTION DOMESTIC CHARGES AND ADDICTION IT'S UNSPOKEN VIOLENCE UNHEARD BUT FELT WHOA AFTER SILENT WHOA SOMETIMES INCEST MOLESTATION LIFE TIME INCARCERATION
THE GREEN FARMLANDS MORPHED INTO DRY SAND AS WE MADE OUR WAY INTO THE DESERT AND SOON EVERYTHING IN SIGHT WAS
I HEARD AND PEOPLE THAT I SPOKE WITH THE MORE I BEGAN TO FEEL ASHAMED FOR THE MISCONCEPTIONS THAT I HELD
EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SUBCONSCIOUS
I STILL FELT ASHAMED
WALKING INTO ZAATARI I REALIZED THAT I CARRIED WITH ME VERY DEEPLY HIDDEN IDEAS ABOUT WHAT REFUGEES SHOULD LOOK LIKE
WHAT THEY SHOULD DRESS LIKE
COMPLEX THAN THE STORIES THAT WE READ IN OUR NEWS FEEDS
OUR NEWS FEEDS CANNOT BE OUR ONLY SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN
THEY CAN GIVE US A FOUNDATION A BASIC UNDERSTANDING
BUT THEY CANNOT BE OUR ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEY DO BUT SO DOES SO MUCH MORE BAD THINGS MAKE NEWS BUT THERE ARE INDUSTRIOUS MEN AND WOMEN LIVING IN THESE PLACES TRYING TO MAKE A GOOD LIFE IN THE MIDST OF A BAD
CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT I INTERVIEWED SELMA IN HER PRIVATE SALON WHICH SHE HAD RECENTLY OPENED SHE WAS A HAIRDRESSER BACK IN SYRIA AND FELT THAT HER LIFE WAS UNPREDICTABLE AND WITHOUT PURPOSE WHEN SHE MOVED TO ZAATARI
THAT NOT ALL OF US CAN HAVE PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH REFUGEES I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF US WILL PROBABLY NEVER EVEN MEET ONE OR KNOW THAT WE DID
WELL I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE SATURATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS THE MAIN FORM OF KNOWLEDGE WE RECEIVE ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND US ALTHOUGH THUMBING THROUGH FACEBOOK AND
INTO THE TOP FLOOR OF HER BUILDING AND EXPLODE WHILE SHE AND HER NEIGHBORS WERE RUNNING DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT I HEARD ABOUT ARMY RAIDS THAT OCCURRED PERIODICALLY
LED ME TO THE REFUGEE STUDY CENTER AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY ACCESS TO THE CAMP WAS GRANTED THROUGH SAVE THE CHILDREN JORDAN AND AFTER ARRIVING IN AMMAN I MET MY BODYGUARD SULTAN
THAT THEY RECEIVED AID THAT THEY WERE POWERLESS AND HELPLESS PEOPLE WHAT I SAW HOWEVER WAS REFUGEES WHO WERE NOT LACKING IN INITIATIVE
140 CHARACTERS HOW MUCH CAN YOU REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE WAY REFUGEES ARE LIVING IN A REFUGEE CAMP WITH SUCH LITTLE INFORMATION OUR RELIANCE ON
SO I WAS FINALLY THERE I WAS FINALLY IN ZAATARI OR SO I THOUGHT BUT
IN AMSTERDAM WE'VE ALSO SHARED OTHER SORTS OF
US ARE MUCH MORE OPEN TO LOCAL COMPANIES OR BRANDS THAT MAYBE WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF WHEREAS BEFORE WE WENT WITH THE BIG BRANDS THAT WE WERE SURE WE TRUSTED AND LAST IS THAT
AND THE CHALLENGE WITH MESH BUSINESSES AND THOSE ARE BUSINESSES LIKE ZIPCAR OR NETFLIX THAT ARE FULL MESH
IT IMPLEMENTED SOMEPLACE SAID WOW THAT LOOKS REALLY COOL I THINK WE CAN DO THAT IN CAMBRIDGE
TO GET GOODS AND SERVICES MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY IN MANY CASES THAN OWNING
I'M THINKING THAT COMING FROM THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF THINGS WE SAW CABLE READY TVS AND WIFI READY NOTEBOOKS IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF ANY MINUTE NOW YOU GUYS COULD START
AND ON THE PLANET ALSO THERE'S BEEN
IT TO CAMBRIDGE AND THEY STARTED TWO WOMEN ROBIN CHASE BEING THE OTHER PERSON WHO STARTED IT ZIPCAR GOT SOME
YOUR AUNT UP AT THE AIRPORT YOU GET A SEDAN AND YOU'RE GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS TO SKI YOU GET DIFFERENT ACCESSORIES PUT ON THE CAR FOR DOING THAT SORT OF
NEWS TRAVELS THE OPPOSITE AS WE KNOW IS ALSO TRUE OFTEN MORE TRUE SO HERE
WE GO TO THE DEALER ONCE WE HAVE AN INTERACTION AND WE'RE CHOW USUALLY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT WHEN
ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY PACKAGED CAR SHARING THEY MADE IT SEXY THEY MADE IT FRESH THEY MADE IT ASPIRATIONAL IF YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THE CLUB WHEN YOU'RE MEMBER OF A CLUB YOU'RE A
ACROSS THE U S AND WESTERN EUROPE IS EIGHT PERCENT
AND SO BASICALLY EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S 10 PERCENT
90 PERCENT OF THE TIME SOMETHING THAT COSTS US A LOT OF MONEY PERSONALLY AND ALSO WE ORGANIZE OUR CITIES AROUND IT AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS 90 PERCENT OF THE TIME IT'S SITTING
TECHNOLOGIES AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS REALLY OUR INHERITANCE IT ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE IN REALLY NEW AND INTERESTING WAYS AND SO FOR ME A MESH COMPANY THE CLASSIC MESH COMPANY BRINGS TOGETHER
OR EIGHT CITIES ALREADY IN THE U S THAT HAVE PROVIDED THE TRANSIT DATA
FOR IF YOU'RE SITTING NEXT TO SOMEONE {LG} THE OTHER THING THAT'S WORTH CONSIDERING IS THAT WE'VE MADE A HUGE INVESTMENT
CONNECTED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS THAT IT'S EASY TO
IN BARCELONA AND B CYCLE AND BORIS BIKES IN LONDON NO ONE HAS HAD TO REPEAT THE VERSION 1 0 SCREW UPS AND EXPENSIVE LEARNING EXERCISES THAT HAPPENED IN PARIS
SO THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE'RE CONNECTED IS ALSO TO SHARE FAILURES AND
TO YOU ABOUT WHAT I CALL THE MESH IT'S ESSENTIALLY FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH STUFF WITH THE THINGS IN OUR
AT FACEBOOK AROUND FACEBOOK FOR EXAMPLE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN MARK ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO WITH A
TO BE IN CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE LISTEN REFINE SOMETHING AND GO BACK
IT'S VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND IT'S VERY MESH Y THE INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLES THAT
IN
CLOSING AND AS WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS THE END I JUST ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND I'M WILLING TO SHARE MY FAILURES AS WELL THOUGH NOT FROM THE STAGE
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WHEN WE LOOK AT WASTE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN REALLY BE GENEROUS AND CONTRIBUTE TO EACH
THAT THE DEMOGRAPHIC FOR WHO THEY WERE TARGETING AND THE CAR WAS ALL MATCHING IT WAS A VERY NICE EXPERIENCE AND THE CARS WERE CLEAN AND RELIABLE AND IT ALL
AROUND IT LACK VITALITY AND VIBRANCY AND ENGAGEMENT THERE'S THIS THING HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE HEARD OF POP UP
BIG FAN OF THIS AND THIS IS A VERY MESH Y THING ESSENTIALLY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF RESTAURANTS IN OAKLAND NEAR WHERE I LIVE THERE'S A POP UP GENERAL STORE EVERY THREE WEEKS AND THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB OF MAKING A VERY SOCIAL
EVENT HAPPENING FOR FOODIES
SUPER FUN AND IT HAPPENS IN A VERY TRANSITIONAL
TO ALIGN THE VALUE WITH THE TRUE COST SECONDLY POPULATION
MAKING ANYWHERE BETWEEN 200 AND 700 DOLLARS A MONTH LETTING THEIR NEIGHBORS USE THEIR CAR WHEN THEY'RE NOT USING IT SO IT'S LIKE VACATION RENTALS FOR
SERVICE BECAUSE WE GIVE THEM SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THEY ARE ENTITLED TO REALLY SEE HOW IT IS THAT WE'RE MOVING THEY'RE IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE
IT'S ENGAGING BUT IT'S VERY EARLY I HAVE A WEBSITE IT'S A DIRECTORY AND IT STARTED WITH ABOUT 1200 COMPANIES AND IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS IT'S UP TO ABOUT 3300 COMPANIES
IN THE CAFE ALL OF A SUDDEN STARTS SHOWING ME THAT THE NEXT BUS IS COMING IN THREE MINUTES AND THE TRAIN IS COMING IN 16 MINUTES AND SO IT'S RELIABLE REAL DATA THAT'S RIGHT IN MY FACE WHERE I AM SO I CAN FINISH THE
OF DEVELOPERS AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE TO COME WITH THEIR IDEAS AND THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE AND TARGET AN APPLICATION FOR A PARTICULAR
TO PEER CAR SHARING SERVICES BECAUSE THE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY WORK FOR CAR SHARING IS ONE
THE CAR HAS TO BE AVAILABLE AND TWO IT'S WITHIN ONE OR TWO BLOCKS OF WHERE YOU STAND WELL THE CAR THAT'S ONE OR TWO BLOCKS FROM YOUR HOME OR YOUR OFFICE IS PROBABLY YOUR NEIGHBOR'S CAR
AND IT'S PROBABLY ALSO AVAILABLE SO PEOPLE HAVE CREATED THIS
A VARIETY OF VENUES BUT ALSO WITH GPS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY LIKE RFID AND IT CONTINUES TO EXPAND BEYOND THAT
ULTIMATELY STARTS AND ENDS WITH WHAT I REFER TO AS THE MOTHER OF ALL SHARE PLATFORMS
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE THINGS POP UP STORES DO IS CREATE PERISHABILITY AND URGENCY IT CREATES TWO OF THE FAVORITE WORDS OF ANY
CONSTANTLY CREATING LIMITS FOR OUR MINDS
WE CREATE WALLS FOR OUR IMAGINATION
NOT TO TRESPASS
WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING
THE SOLUTION FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS DYSTONIAS PARKINSON'S DISEASE GENERALIZED DYSTONIAS
OR EVEN CEREBRAL PALSY
TO BE
A NEW DRIVE OR A NEW DEVICE
THIS IS WHAT WE SAW
ASK YOUR BRAIN TO BRING MOVEMENTS EMOTIONS SENSATIONS BACK TO LIFE WE CAN EVEN ASK YOUR BRAIN
NOT ACCESSIBLE IN THE BRAIN
YOU CAN TRANSFER IT FROM ANOTHER PERSON
IT LOOKS LIKE
MOVEMENT IS LEARNED
AND MODULATED
SOCIALLY
OUR MOTHERS TOLD US HOW TO
BLINK NOT
ONLY HOW TO READ OR OUR LANGUAGE THEY ALSO TAUGHT US
ESSENTIAL
THAT ONLY A BRAIN CAN UNDERSTAND IMAGINE THAT WE CRACK THIS CODE AND BY USING THIS LANGUAGE IN CODE WE CAN ASK YOUR BRAIN TO
THE NEUROSOFTWARE IS NOT ACCESSIBLE IN THE BRAIN YOU CAN TRANSFER IT BY MIMICKING ANOTHER PERSON'S MOVEMENT AND MAKE IT YOURS
NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
WILL HAVE THE SAME QUALITY THE SAME EFFICIENCY IN FIRST WORLD OR THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
WE WILL PRESCRIBE
ORGANIZED MOVEMENTS CHOREOGRAPHIES
SPECIFIC CHOREOGRAPHIES FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS
FOR SPECIFIC PATIENTS
ITS OWN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION THIS NEW FORM OF THERAPY WILL NOT
FROM NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE INCURABLE
I HAVE THIS BOX WITH ME TODAY
BECAUSE IT IS A SYMBOL
WE ARE TOLD THAT WE THINK IN BOXES
AND IN FACT WE DO
AND THE ONES THAT YOU HAVE JUST INSTALLED IF YOU DO RESEARCH IN NEUROSCIENCE YOU HAVE TO BE A SKEPTIC
THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TREAT SUCCESSFULLY TODAY IMAGINE THAT YOUR OWN MOVEMENTS
FOR YOU TO BLINK WALK TALK
BUT WE CAN THINK OUTSIDE OF THIS BOX I ASK YOU TO STOP FOR A SECOND AND START IMAGINING
DURING MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL
THERE WAS A WEEK THAT WAS UNUSUALLY STRESSFUL AND I WASN'T GETTING VERY MUCH SLEEP
I STARTED TO DEVELOPING A SKIN RASH ON MY HANDS AND MY ELBOWS
MY DERMATOLOGIST EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO MY LACK OF SLEEP
BUT AT THE TIME I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
SO NOW I UNDERSTOOD WHAT MY DERMATOLOGIST WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW SLEEP COULD AFFECT SKIN
BUT MY CURIOSITY DIDN'T END THERE
I STILL HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS WHY DO WE NEED SLEEP
HOW DO WE GET RID OF ALLERGIES
AND THE ONE THAT WAS MOST INTRIGUING TO ME
WHAT OTHER FACTORS AFFECT SKIN DEVELOPMENT
USUALLY WHEN I EXPLAIN MY RESEARCH TO PEOPLE THEY RESPOND BY SAYING
OH SO YOU CURE CANCER
AND WHILE THIS NOTION OF CURING CANCER SOUNDS VERY GRAND
THE GENERAL IDEA IS ACTUALLY GREATLY MISUNDERSTOOD
IN REALITY THE WORD CANCER ITSELF IS QUITE MISLEADING
BECAUSE IT
WITH ABOUT 1 MILLION NEW CASES ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE RARELY INVASIVE THEY STILL CONTRIBUTE TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF ALL SKIN CANCER RELATED DEATHS
IN COLORADO WHERE WE HAVE OVER 300 DAYS OF SUNSHINE SKIN CANCER
A TREATMENT LIKE THIS IS NOT ONLY MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CURRENT THERAPIES IT'S ALSO MORE ACCESSIBLE LESS INVASIVE AND MUCH CHEAPER THANK YOU
BASICALLY ALL OF THOSE EVENINGS WITH VERY LITTLE SLEEP HAS STRESSED MY BODY TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO BACTERIAL INFECTION
THIRD TYPE MELANOMA IS CONSIDERABLY MORE MALIGNANT
IN FACT ONE AMERICAN DIES OF MELANOMA ALMOST EVERY HOUR
CURRENTLY WE HAVE MANY AVAILABLE TREATMENTS FOR THESE SKIN CANCERS EXCEPT NONE OF THEM ARE VERY EFFICIENT
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY AFFECT TUMORS
THEY ARE ALSO DAMAGING PERFECTLY HEALTHY TISSUE
SEE THAT TASK WAS PARTICULARLY DAUNTING
BUT EVENTUALLY THROUGH A VERY EXTENSIVE PROCESS OF TRIAL AND ERROR
I CAME ACROSS A
POTENTIAL PROTEIN CANDIDATE A PROTEIN KNOWN AS
OR MCAT FOR SHORT
MCAT PLAYS A VERY SPECIFIC ROLE IN THE CELL TO CONVERT
BUT WHEN EVEN A SINGLE TRAIN RUNS OFF ITS TRACK THE ENTIRE SYSTEM LOSES CONTROL THAT'S HOW IT IS WITH CANCER CELLS THEY ARE SIMPLY TOO COMPLEX FOR US TO FIND A GENERIC CURE SO NO
PROTEIN OUT OF ALL OF THESE THAT IS ONLY EXPRESSED IN SKIN CANCERS AND NOT IN HEALTHY SKIN CELLS
WHERE MY WORK COMES IN I WANT TO FIND A WAY THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET SKIN CANCERS WITHOUT DAMAGING ANY OF SURROUNDING CELLS BUT CANCER WORK IS RARELY THAT SIMPLE OR EASY BECAUSE CELLS ARE QUITE FRANKLY VERY VERY COMPLICATED
WITHOUT MCAT ON THE OTHER HAND SKIN CANCER CELLS BECAUSE THEY GROW SO RAPIDLY AND CONSUME SO MUCH ENERGY SHOULD RELY HEAVILY ON MY MCAT ACTIVITY
AT A REAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE SO AFTER EMAILING COUNTLESS PROFESSORS AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER I EVENTUALLY FOUND MYSELF PERFORMING GRADUATE LEVEL DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH AS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WANTED TO EXPLORE THAT QUESTION FURTHER BUT RATHER THAN RUN ANOTHER POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC EXPERIMENT TO MY CLOSET I DECIDED TO LOOK FOR A
SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES AND {NS} BUT TAKE A LOOK AGAIN AT OUR CELL SUBWAY MAP
HAS REVOLVED AROUND ASKING QUESTIONS QUESTIONS THAT HAVE OFTENTIMES DRIVEN ME TO DO THINGS OF DUBIOUS ADVISABILITY {LG} LIKE EATING PACKING PEANUTS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE INCIDENCES OCCURRED FOUR YEARS AGO
TOWARDS A WORLD WITHOUT CANCER
LIKEWISE IT TAKES THE SAME SMALL STEPS TO UNCOVER THE COUNTLESS OTHER MYSTERIES IN LIFE
AND SO TODAY I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO TAKE THOSE SMALL STEPS TO ASK QUESTIONS TO EXPERIMENT TO DO THINGS OF DUBIOUS ADVISABILITY
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S THOSE EXPLORATIONS THAT HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES AROUND US
THANK YOU
THIS PARTICULAR MAP ILLUSTRATES CELLULAR METABOLISM THE COLLECTION OF ALL OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT OCCUR IN A CELL IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LIFE
LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT I MANAGED TO BUY ONE MALE AND ONE FEMALE MOUSE {LG} PUT THEM IN THE SAME CAGE
ARE HUGE IN THE FUTURE WE WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A LOTION THAT CAN DELIVER A DRUG TO INHIBIT MCAT
PEOPLE CAN APPLY THIS LOTION TO A REGION WITH A POTENTIAL SKIN TUMOR
AS A RESULT THEY ARE PREVENTING THE ONSET OF SKIN CANCER WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY OF THE SURROUNDING TISSUE
CAPABLE OF GENERATING LARGE SUMS OF ENERGY I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WOULD PHYSICALLY HAPPEN TO THESE CELLS IF I WERE TO REMOVE THIS MCAT I PREDICTED THAT HEALTHY SKIN CELLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE VERY MUCH ENERGY SHOULD BE ABLE TO
NOT CURE CANCER IN FACT NOBODY IS EVER GOING TO CURE CANCER BUT ALL OF OUR DISCOVERIES AND ALL OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE
ESSENTIALLY I FOUND A PROTEIN THAT WHEN INHIBITED CAN PREVENT SKIN CANCER GROWTH WITHOUT AFFECTING SKIN TISSUE GROWTH AND THE
COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES IN FACT
COULD AFFECT MY SKIN SO BEING A CURIOUS SELF I DECIDED TO RUN AN
AND ALL OVER THE WORLD EMINENT EVOLUTIONISTS ARE ANXIOUS TO CELEBRATE THIS
AND WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO IS TO ENLIGHTEN US ON ALMOST EVERY ASPECT
OF DARWIN AND HIS LIFE AND HOW HE CHANGED OUR THINKING
I SAY ALMOST EVERY ASPECT BECAUSE THERE IS ONE ASPECT OF THIS STORY WHICH THEY HAVE THROWN NO LIGHT ON AND THEY SEEM ANXIOUS TO SKIRT AROUND IT AND STEP OVER IT AND TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT
IT'S THE QUESTION OF
WHY ARE WE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE CHIMPANZEES
WE GET THE GENETICISTS KEEPING ON TELLING US HOW EXTREMELY CLOSELY WE ARE RELATED HARDLY ANY GENES OF DIFFERENCE VERY VERY CLOSELY RELATED
AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK
AND WE GOT SO OVERHEATED IN THE CHASE THAT WE HAD TO TAKE OFF THAT FUR COAT
INVESTIGATED THEY CONDUCTED A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION OF THIS AT THE BEGINNING
IT INTO A PRINCIPLE IT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING AARON FILLER FROM HARVARD SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE STOPPED TALKING ABOUT SELECTIVE PRESSURES I MEAN WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT WELL
THOMAS S KUHN
WROTE
A SEMINAL TREATISE ABOUT THIS BACK IN 1962
HE SAID WHAT SCIENTISTS DO
WHEN A PARADIGM FAILS
IS GUESS WHAT THEY CARRY ON AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
OFF THE AQUATIC THEORY TO PROTECT A THEORY OF THEIR OWN WHICH THEY'VE ALL AGREED ON AND THEY LOVE THERE IS NOTHING THERE THEY ARE STAVING OFF THE AQUATIC THEORY TO PROTECT A VACUUM
OVER THE TALL GRASS OR TO CHASE AFTER ANIMALS OR TO FREE OUR HANDS FOR
AND THERE'S GENES AND WE JUST RECORD WHAT WE SEE
CHARLES DARWIN MUST BE SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE
HE KNEW ALL ABOUT THAT KIND OF SCIENCE AND HE CALLED IT HYPOTHESIS FREE SCIENCE AND HE DESPISED IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART
AND
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING ABOUT SELECTIVE PRESSURES YOU CAN TAKE THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES AND THROW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW FOR IT'S ABOUT NOTHING ELSE BUT
ELSE
AND ALL OUR RELATIVES LET'S LOOK AT OUR NAKED SKIN
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT MOST OF THE THINGS WE THINK ABOUT THAT HAVE LOST THEIR BODY HAIR MAMMALS WITHOUT BODY HAIR
ARE AQUATIC ONES LIKE THE DUGONG THE WALRUS THE DOLPHIN THE HIPPOPOTAMUS THE MANATEE
AND A COUPLE OF WALLOWERS IN MUD LIKE THE BABIRUSA
AND
YOU'RE TEMPTED TO THINK WELL PERHAPS COULD THAT BE
WHY WE ARE NAKED I SUGGESTED IT AND PEOPLE SAID NO NO NO I MEAN LOOK AT THE ELEPHANT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE ELEPHANT HAVEN'T YOU
SO BACK IN 1982 I SAID WELL PERHAPS THE ELEPHANT HAD
AN AQUATIC ANCESTOR
PEALS OF MERRY LAUGHTER THAT CRAZY WOMAN SHE'S OFF AGAIN SHE'LL SAY ANYTHING WON'T SHE
AND IF YOU'VE GOT A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T SOLVE IT BY HOLDING A HEAD COUNT AND SAYING
OF WHAT HAVE BEEN CALLED THE HALLMARKS OF MANKIND THE THINGS THAT MADE US DIFFERENT
BROKE LOOSE ALL HIS COLLEAGUES SAID THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS YOU'VE EXPOSED US TO PUBLIC RIDICULE YOU MUST NEVER DO THAT AGAIN AND AT THAT TIME IT BECAME
EVERYBODY AGREES WITH IT
PROFESSOR TOBIAS CAME OVER FROM SOUTH AFRICA
AND SPOKE TO UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON
HE SAID
EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS FORGET ABOUT IT IT WAS WRONG
WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO
SOON BECAUSE I'M OLDER NOW THAN GEORGE BURNS WAS WHEN HE SAID
AT MY AGE I DON'T EVEN BUY GREEN BANANAS
SO IF IT'S GOING TO COME AND IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WHAT'S HOLDING IT UP
I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THREE WORDS
ACADEMIA
SAYS
NO
THEY
SAVANNA SPECIES AND THEY LOOKED AT THE HERBIVORES AND THEY WEREN'T SAVANNA HERBIVORES AND THEN THEY WERE SO CLEVER THEY FOUND A WAY TO ANALYZE
LOUD AND CLEAR IS YES THEY CAN ALL BE WRONG HISTORY IS STREWN WITH THE CASES WHEN THEY'VE ALL GOT IT WRONG
WELL THIS IS 2009 AND IT'S THE BICENTENARY OF
ONE OF THREE THINGS IS GOING TO HAPPEN
EITHER THEY WILL GO ON FOR THE NEXT 40 YEARS 50 YEARS 60 YEARS YEAH WELL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING INTERESTING
THAT WOULD BE VERY SAD
THE SECOND THING THAT COULD HAPPEN
IS THAT SOME YOUNG GENIUS WILL ARRIVE AND SAY I'VE FOUND IT IT WAS NOT THE SAVANNA IT WAS NOT THE WATER IT WAS THIS
NO SIGN OF THAT HAPPENING EITHER
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A THIRD OPTION
SO THE THIRD THING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN
IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL THING
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE EARLY YEARS OF THE LAST CENTURY
THERE WAS A STAND OFF A LOT OF BICKERING AND BAD FEELING BETWEEN THE BELIEVERS IN MENDEL
AND THE BELIEVERS IN DARWIN
IT ENDED WITH A NEW SYNTHESIS
DARWIN'S IDEAS AND MENDEL'S IDEAS BLENDING TOGETHER
AND I THINK THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN HERE
YOU'LL GET A NEW SYNTHESIS
STONE THE AQUATIC THEORY SHOULD BE DUMPED
INTO A KIND OF PRIESTHOOD
BUT YOU KNOW
THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD
BECAUSE RICHARD DAWKINS HAS TOLD US
HOW TO TREAT A PRIESTHOOD
HE SAYS FIRSTLY YOU'VE GOT TO REFUSE TO GIVE IT ALL THE EXCESSIVE AWE AND REVERENCE
IT'S BEEN TRAINED TO RECEIVE
RIGHT I'LL GO AHEAD WITH THAT
AND SECONDLY HE SAYS YOU MUST NEVER BE AFRAID TO ROCK THE BOAT
I'LL GO ALONG WITH THAT TOO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
OF THE APES STAYED IN THE TREES OUR ANCESTORS WENT OUT ONTO THE PLAIN THAT EXPLAINED EVERYTHING WE HAD TO GET UP ON OUR LEGS TO
TO DO
WITH ITS
CONSCIOUS CONTROL OF ITS BREATH YOU CAN'T EVEN TRAIN
A GORILLA TO SAY AH ON REQUEST
THE ONLY
CREATURES THAT HAVE GOT CONSCIOUS CONTROL OF THEIR BREATH
ARE
ANIMALS ARE NAKED BECAUSE LOOK AT THE SEA OTTER BUT YOU CAN SAY THAT
SOMEBODY UP THERE
IS ISSUING
THE
COMMANDMENT THOU SHALT NOT BELIEVE
IN THE
AND IF YOU HOPE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS PROFESSION AND YOU DO BELIEVE IT YOU'D BETTER KEEP IT TO
SAY YES THAN SAY NO
APART FROM THAT SOME OF THE HEADS COUNT MORE THAN OTHERS
SOME OF THEM HAVE COME OVER
THERE WAS PROFESSOR TOBIAS HE'S COME OVER
DANIEL DENNETT
HE'S COME OVER SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH HE'S COME OVER
ANYBODY ELSE OUT
NO FAT INSIDE AT ALL ALL IN BLUBBER OUTSIDE
WE CANNOT AVOID
THE SUSPICION
THAT IN OUR CASE IT'S STARTED TO HAPPEN WE HAVE GOT SKIN
LINED WITH THIS LAYER IT'S THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF WHY
HUMANS
IF THEY'RE VERY UNLUCKY
CAN BECOME
MUCH SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED NOW 50 YEARS AGO THAT WAS A LAUGHABLY SIMPLE QUESTION EVERYBODY KNEW THE ANSWER THEY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED
ROOM AS MARC LAID THERE STRUGGLING FOR HIS LIFE HIS DAD LOOKED INTO HIS EYES AND READ HELP ME DAD AND HE DID HE STARTED AN AMAZING FOUNDATION CALLED THE MIAMI PROJECT WHICH IS ALL ABOUT HELPING
TO COME BACK
THAT IS UNTIL I BLEW A MILLION DOLLARS
THAT FALL AFTER THE CRASH I RECEIVED SETTLEMENT FROM THE PLANE'S INSURANCE COMPANY
YOU'D THINK THAT WOULD HELP OUT A LITTLE BIT BUT IT DIDN'T IN FACT THE MONEY MADE ME FEEL TERRIBLE
I DIDN'T WANT MONEY BACK I WANTED BION BACK I WANTED OUR LIFE BACK
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HARD
BUT IT DID
WAS ON AOL BACK THEN YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT MAIL {LG} WE GOT OVER 1000 FRANCHISE SALES LEADS FROM THAT ONE DAY IT WAS CRAZY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WE SOLD
I CRINGED AND I LOOK OVER AND THE REPORTER SMILES AT ME AND HE TITLES THE FIRST ARTICLE
I WAS DEVASTATED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WEEKS I WAS SO LOST AND SAD THAT I COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED BUT THERE WERE TWO LITTLE CREATURES THAT HELPED ME
WAS FLYING
THANK GOODNESS I FOLLOWED MY PASSION AND NOT WHAT WAS PRACTICAL
BY DOING WHAT I LOVED IT HELPED ME COME BACK
DOGS WERE MY PASSION AND FRANCHISING WAS HOW I HELPED OTHER PEOPLE
IN SYSTEM SALES YES THAT'S A LOT OF DOGGIES A LOT OF FUR AND WERE ABLE TO SELL TO VCA THE LARGEST VETERINARY CHAIN LAST YEAR FOR SOME
FOUND LOVE AGAIN
WE GOT MARRIED IN A VEGAS DRIVE THROUGH WITH 12 YEAR OLD TORI IN TOW
AND WE STARTED WORKING ON GROWING OUR FAMILY
WELL THAT DIDN'T COME EASY EITHER NOTHING IN MY LIFE AT THAT POINT SEEMED TO
AND I HAD SEVERAL MISCARRIAGES I WENT THROUGH IN VITRO TREATMENT
BUT WHEN WE DID HAVE THE COMEBACK FINALLY IT WAS A BIG ONE
WE
CRASHED IN 2008 AND ALL HECK HAD BROKEN LOOSE
BUT WE DUG IN AND FOUGHT BACK
CAMP BOW WOW WAS ALMOST DESTROYED BY THE RECESSION BY THE DOWNTURN AND SO WAS FRANCHISING IN GENERAL WHEN FINANCING DRIED UP
I HAD TO LAY OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING SOME CLOSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS BECAUSE ABOUT HALF OF MY TEAM WERE CLOSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT'S A WHOLE ANOTHER TALK
WELL HONESTLY I DIDN'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I REALLY DIDN'T
UNTIL THE ART OF THE COMEBACK KIND OF CAME TO ME IN AN UNLIKELY PLACE MY PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE
I SAT AND TALKED TO DR BUCKNAM ABOUT TORI'S HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS AND HOW LOST AND SAD THEY WERE
HE TOLD ME THAT IN ALL OF HIS YEARS AS A DOCTOR
HIS PIECE OF ADVICE FOR PARENTS THAT HAVE KIDS THAT ARE LOST OR ACTING OUT WAS SIMPLY TO TURN THEM OUTWARD TO FOCUS THEM ON THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE PART OF SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN THEMSELVES
HE'D GO WE WANTED THEM TO GIVE BACK TO COME BACK THEY SHOULD GIVE BACK
THAT EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD DO NOT THE BUSINESS THAT BION AND I HAD DREAMED UP
THEY THOUGHT DOGGY DAY CARE CAMP BOW BOW WAS ABSURD
WHAT WAS ABSURD WAS THAT I HAD JUST BLOWN A MILLION DOLLARS IN UNDER SIX YEARS
SO I WAS A SINGLE MOM BACK IN PHARMACEUTICAL SALES WITH 83000 LEFT IN A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT
MY LITTLE BROTHER PATRICK KNEW I WAS STRUGGLING AND HE CAME TO ME AND SAID WHY DON'T WE DUST OFF THE OLD BUSINESS PLAN FOR CAMP BOW WOW AND SEE IF WE CAN'T JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN
MARRIAGE COST ME HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SETTLEMENT AND FIVE YEARS IN COURT TO GET OUT OF IT DID HOWEVER GIVE ME A BEAUTIFUL GIFT TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME OF LIFE AND THAT IS MY
A PLANE CRASH A BUS CRASH HAVING HIS CAR BLOWN UP TWICE AND GETTING HIT BY A CITY BUS {LG} SERIOUSLY TRUE STORY FRANE ALSO WON THE CROATIAN LOTTERY OF A MILLION DOLLARS
DID NOT THINK I WAS GOING TO FIND ANYONE LIKE HIM AGAIN BUT MY CLOSE FRIEND BECCA DID SOMETHING MAGICAL SHE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS CUTE NEW NEIGHBOR OF HERS JASON JASON
WITH VINTAGE STUNT PLANES WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE PERFECT SURPRISE BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY YOUNG
I DEALT WITH BUSINESS THAT FAILED BEFORE THE ONE THAT WORKED AND THEN A TOUGH DIVORCE AND CUSTODY BATTLE AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK SOMEBODY
AND FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE OR SOMEONE ELSE
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THE PLANE CRASH HAPPENED I HAD CARED FOR MY DOGS FIRST AND THAT GOT ME OUT OF BED EVERYDAY THEN I CARED FOR TORI WHICH GOT ME BACK
INTO LIFE AND REALLY ENGAGED THEN I STARTED HELPING MY FRANCHISEES OPEN THEIR BUSINESSES AND FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS AND FINALLY I WAS ABLE TO HELP ALL THOSE DOGS WITH THE FOUNDATION
SO
FRANE NICHOLAS NICOLE AND I
WE ALL LOOKED OUTSIDE WE TURNED OUTWARD WE HELPED OTHERS BUT IN THE END IT HELPED US HEAL OURSELVES
THAT'S WHAT WE DID
TO COME BACK WE GAVE BACK
THAT IS THE ART OF THE
ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS CALLED SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT TOO
AND THEY WANTED TO DO AN ARTICLE ON US SO I SHOW UP TO THE BUILDING I WALK INTO CAMP AND I'M GOING TO MEET THE REPORTER AND I HEAR MY BROTHER YELLING AT THE DOGS IN THE BACKGROUND IN THE PLAY YARDS HEY NO
GO THROUGH THINGS IN OUR LIVES THAT IMPACT US INFLUENCE US AND CHANGE US
BUT WHILE WE CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO US
WE CAN CONTROL HOW WE REACT TO IT
AND THAT REACTION IS PART OF WHAT I THINK IS THE ART OF THE COMEBACK
AND I ASKED PAUL IF HE THOUGHT THAT TEACHER TOUGHT
GEORGE HAD ANY TALENT HE SAID NO
SO I SAID WELL LOOK
BECAUSE PART OF MY ARGUMENT IS THAT TALENTS OFTEN BURIED YOU HAVE TO GO LOOKING FOR IT AND CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR IT
SO I SAID WELL
WOULD THIS BE A FAIR COMMENT
THAT THERE WAS JUST ONE MUSIC TEACHER
IN LIVERPOOL IN THE LATE 1950S
WHO HAD HALF THE BEATLES IN HIS CLASS
AND
THEME HERE THAT YOU MISUNDERSTAND THE COSMOS ARRANGED THINGS SO THESE EIGHT SOUL MATES CONVERGE AT THE SAME POINT OF THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM THEY SHOULD MEET AND PROCREATE AND CONTINUE THE PROCESS THAT HAS LED TO THE MIRACLE THAT IT IS ME
JOHN HAS BEEN DOING OUR FAMILY TREE
IT'S NOT MUCH OF TREE TRUTHFULLY IT'S LIKE A SMALL SHRUB ISN'T IT
BUT HE
DISCOVERED THAT SEVEN OF OUR EIGHT GREAT GRANDPARENTS
WERE ALL BORN IN LIVERPOOL IN THE 19TH CENTURY WITHIN TWO MILES OF EACH OTHER
THAT'S HOW THEY MET
THEY RAN INTO EACH OTHER
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE USED TO MEET YOU KNOW LIFE WAS VERY LOCAL
PEOPLE DIDN'T TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES LIKE YOU ALL DO PEOPLE JUST WENT TO WORK AND CAME HOME IT WAS AS FAR AS THEY COULD
I HAD TO INTRODUCE THE DALAI LAMA
I MEAN HERB ACTUALLY INTRODUCED ME
BUDDHISTS AS YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE GREAT WORK THERE BUDDHISTS BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION SO
HE'S THE 14TH DALAI LAMA
SO IT'S A LOT TO GET IN TO AN INTRODUCTION YOU KNOW
THAT I DON'T THINK SO I JUST THINK THEY HAD LOWER STANDARDS THEN FRANKLY I THINK {LG} I THINK PEOPLE RAN INTO EACH OTHER IN THE STREET AND THOUGHT YOU'LL DO
TO BE WRONG AND MAKE A MISTAKE AND TRY IT THAT'S HOW
YOU CREATE A LIFE OF SOME SORT AND IT'S A MIRACLE AND IT'S AMAZED ME HOW LITTLE PEOPLE SETTLE FOR VERY OFTEN THEY GO THROUGH THEIR LIVES IN A STATE OF ANXIETY THINKING IF I TRY IT IT WON'T WORK ANYONE WHO EVER ACHIEVED ANYTHING HIS
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANGELINA JOLIE WAS IN PROSPECT OR BRAD PITT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TMZ OR PEOPLE MAGAZINE IT WAS JUST THE PEOPLE AROUND BUT HERE'S THE POINT YOU SEE THEY WENT ON AND HAD KIDS AND
RIGHT IN
YOUR NAME HE SAID I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WHAT
DO YOU THINK
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU SEE I LOVE THAT IT'S BEEN THE THEME OF THE AFTERNOON ISN'T
IT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T
AND BEING PREPARED TO SAY I'M GOING TO FIND OUT
IT RAN THROUGH ALL PRESENTATIONS WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE RESTAURANT I DON'T KNOW I'LL TRY IT IT'S
NOT OVER AS LONG AS YOU ARE ALIVE AND BREATHING AND MAYBE NOT EVEN
THEN AND THE GREAT TEACHERS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ALSO LEARN WITH THEIR STUDENTS
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM OF EDUCATION WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO KNOW AND IF YOU GET IT WRONG YOU FAILED
ALL THE GREAT QUESTIONS ARE
ASKED THIS QUESTION AND HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH
AND PONDERED THIS FOR PROBABLY ABOUT A MINUTE IT'S A LONG TIME AND
WE WERE ALL THINKING THIS IS GOING TO BE FANTASTIC
THIS MAN HAS THE DEFINITE ARTICLE IN HIS NAME SO HE'S GOING
TO WAIT UNTIL HE COMES UP WITH THIS AND THEN HE LEANT FORWARD HE TOOK A BREATH SO HERE HE COMES
AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW
THE WAY MARK'S DONE A WONDERFUL JOB I ASKED PAUL MCCARTNEY IF HE HAD ENJOYED MUSIC AT SCHOOL AND HE SAID NO HE HADN'T I SAID DID YOUR MUSIC TEACHER THINK YOU HAD ANY TALENT HE SAID NO
AND HERE WE ARE AND IT'S A MIRACLE THAT FOLLOWED
BUT
THE THING IS I TELL YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK OF THE CHANCES OF YOU BEING BORN AT ALL THAT'S PRETTY REMOTE
STATISTICALLY
ALL THE PEOPLE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED THINK HOW YOU MET YOUR PARTNER IF YOU HAVE ONE THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE REMOTE THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT YOUR LIFE IS COMPOSED BY CHOICES YOU
ONCE THEY MANAGED TO KEEP ELVIS OUT OF THE PICTURE
AND THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT YOUR LIFE IS YOU CREATE IT ACCORDING TO THE TALENTS YOU DISCOVER OR NOT YOU MENTIONED THE DALAI LAMA
AND A FEW YEARS AGO I HOSTED A SESSION AT THE VANCOUVER PEACE SUMMIT
AND HE WAS THE GUEST OF HONOR
WE HAD ABOUT 2000 PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
IT WAS A SESSION CALLED WORLD PEACE THROUGH PERSONAL PEACE
SO WE HAD ABOUT AN HOUR
TO SOLVE THAT UP
PROGRESS HOW YOU BUILD A LEGACY AND HAVE A LIFE IN THE PROCESS
EVERYONE MAKES HIS OWN CHOICE ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING
AND I JUST FEEL THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT FEATURES OF THE AFTERNOON AND THIS MORNING I'M SURE I WASN'T ABLE TO BE HERE
BUT WE'VE HAD LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO'VE CREATED VERY DIFFERENT LIVES AND THEY'RE AFFECTING PEOPLE VERY DIFFERENTLY
IT'S IN THE WAY WE DO THAT THAT WE CREATE A
ARE JEOPARDIZING LIFE ON EARTH THE WAY WE'RE BEHAVING BUT THE THING
IS HUMAN CULTURE IS ALWAYS PROGRESSING THROUGH POWER OF IMAGINATION CREATIVITY THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE REST ON EARTH ALTHOUGH WE'RE INTIMATELY CONNECTED AND WE KEEP FORGETTING
IT IF YOU'VE GOT
A DOG
YOUR DOG PROBABLY HAS ALL KINDS OF FEELINGS AND MAY HAVE SOME KIND OF IMAGINATION BUT
IT DOESN'T MANIFEST IT IN QUITE THE SAME WAY
YOU DON'T SEE YOUR DOG STARRING OUT THE WINDOW DEPRESSED READING CAMUS
YOU'D SAY DO YOU COME FOR WALK AND HE'D
SAY NO
NO YOU GO OUT I'M NOT IN THE MOOD YOU GO
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A VIRTUAL WORLD WE LIVE IN WORLD OF IDEAS IN A WORLD OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND THEORIES AND POSSIBILITIES
IT'S THE OLD MAXIM NOTHING IS SO POWERFUL AS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME
NOTHING IS SO INFLUENTIAL AS A LIFE WELL LIVED
AND THAT'S REALLY
I THINK WHAT TODAY HAS BEEN ABOUT AND I WANT IN YOUR BEHALF TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS THIS AFTERNOON
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE AND THIS REALLY RESONATES TO ME I AM ONE OF SEVEN KIDS AND MY BROTHER JOHN WHO'S SITTING RIGHT THERE THERE'S MY BROTHER JOHN I HAD AN ARM AROUND HIM MOST OF THE AFTERNOON I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON THERE
I'M JUST SAYING ELVIS PRESLEY THAT ELVIS MENTIONED EARLIER WENT TO SCHOOL IN TUPELO MISSISSIPPI AND HE WASN'T ALLOWED IN THE GLEE CLUB AT SCHOOL THEY SAID HE WOULD RUIN THEIR SOUND
WHO WAS IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A MATHEMATICIAN AND ANYONE WHO'S BEEN BITTEN BY THE NUMBERS BUG KNOWS THAT IT BITES EARLY AND IT BITES DEEP
WAS LOOK ADAM YOU ARE AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN YOUR LIFE HERE MY FRIEND YOU CAN KEEP SITTING HERE WITH US
FRANK NELSON COLE DID NOT STOP THERE HE WENT ON AND ON AND CALCULATED 67 POWERS OF TWO HE TOOK AWAY ONE AND WROTE THAT NUMBER ON THE
THE SYMPHONY OF THE UNIVERSE IS WRITTEN THE GREAT DESCARTES SAID
THAT THE THINGS THAT MAKE US UP HAVE NO MASS I'VE CLEARLY GOT MASS WHERE DOES IT COME FROM AND HE POSTULATED SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S
I FELL IN LOVE WITH MATHEMATICS FROM THE EARLIEST OF AGES I
AS I EXPLAINED TO ASK A COMPUTER IS THAT NUMBER PRIME TO TYPE IT IN ITS ABBREVIATED FORM AND THEN ONLY ABOUT SIX LINES OF CODE IS THE TEST FOR PRIMACY IS A REMARKABLY SIMPLE QUESTION TO ASK
IDEA HIGGSY WE'VE GOT NO IDEA IF WE COULD EVER PROVE IT IT'S BEYOND OUR REACH AND WITHIN JUST 50 YEARS IN HIS LIFETIME WITH HIM
YEARS AGO PETER HIGGS AND HIS TEAM CONSIDERED ONE OF THE DEEPEST OF ALL {NS}
THE SQUARE PEG WILL PASS QUITE EASILY THROUGH THE ROUND HOLE {LG} IT'D BE LIKE PUTTING A PIECE OF TOAST THROUGH A BASKETBALL HOOP WOULDN'T IT AND THERE WAS THAT SAME
BIGGEST PRIME NUMBER THEY KEEP GOING ON FOREVER WE KNOW THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF
IN THE FIELD OF MATHEMATICS AS IN SO MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM IN THIS TED THE AGE OF THE COMPUTER GOES ALONG AND THINGS EXPLODE
AS WE GO HUNTING FOR MASSIVE PRIMES WE REALIZE IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO PUT IN ANY PRIME NUMBER IN THE POWER
ABOUT PRIME NUMBERS MATHEMATICIANS HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED WELL AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT IN TIME WHAT IS THE BIGGEST PRIME THAT WE KNOW ABOUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HUNT FOR THAT MASSIVE PRIME
UP L DOG {LG} BUT ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE SEARCH FOR MASSIVE PRIMES IT'S NOT
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A NANOSECOND I TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE ROAD MAP OF LIFE
YEARS AGO HELD THE RECORD FOR THE LARGEST EVER PRIME ONLY TO SEE IT SNATCHED AWAY BY A RIVAL UNIVERSITY AND THEN CURTIS COOPER GOT IT BACK
ADAM WE'RE HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HAPPY BUT
ANY MORE OF THAT SORT OF TALK YOU'VE GOT TO GO AND SIT OVER THERE WITH THEM
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF BEING HUMAN THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ALL ABOUT OR AS MY FRIEND DESCARTES MIGHT
LAPTOP AT HOME WAS LOOKING THROUGH FOUR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE PRIMES MYSELF AS PART OF A NETWORKED COMPUTER HUNT AROUND THE WORLD FOR THESE LARGE NUMBERS THE DISCOVERY OF THAT PRIME IS SIMILAR TO THE WORK PEOPLE
IT'S GOT A REMARKABLY CLEAR YES NO ANSWER AND JUST REQUIRES PHENOMENAL GRUNT LARGE PRIME NUMBERS ARE A GREAT WAY OF TESTING
WITH NO WORDS HE ADMITTED AFTERWARDS IT WASN'T THAT HARD TO DO IT TOOK FOCUS IT TOOK DEDICATION IT TOOK HIM BY HIS
SLIDE EVERY SECOND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN FIVE HOURS TO SHOW YOU THAT NUMBER
DIDN'T GET MUCH SEXIER THAN THE SPENCE AT UNIVERSITY LET ME TELL YOU IT IS SUCH A THRILL FOR A HUMBLE BREAKFAST RADIO ANNOUNCER FROM SYDNEY AUSTRALIA TO BE HERE ON THE TED
I'D DONE ON MY SHOW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BOOK I READ THE ARTS NO NO NO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MY TWO GORGEOUS DAUGHTERS HAD DONE NO IT WASN'T THE HIGHLIGHT OF 2012 SO CLEARLY WAS THE DISCOVERY
TO A REALIZATION ABOUT MY OWN ABILITY
PUT SIMPLY IN A ROOM FULL OF RANDOMLY SELECTED PEOPLE I'M A MATHS GENIUS
IN A ROOMFUL OF MATHS PH DS I'M AS DUMB AS BOX OF HAMMERS
MY SKILL IS NOT IN THE MATHEMATICS IT
AND HALF AGAIN HERE'S A SLIDE OF THE FIRST
HELPING OUT FOR THE SEARCH BUT FOR ME IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE IT'S METAPHOR FOR THE TIME IN WHICH WE LIVE WHEN
AND MACHINES CAN CONQUER TOGETHER WE'VE HEARD LOT ABOUT ROBOTS IN THIS TED WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO IT IS TRUE YOU CAN NOW DOWNLOAD ONTO YOUR SMARTPHONE AN APP THAT WOULD BEAT MOST GRANDMASTERS AT CHESS YOU THINK THAT'S
ON TWITTER THERE WAS TWEET ADAM HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW LARGEST PRIME NUMBER I SHIVERED
CONTACTED THE WOMEN WHO PRODUCED MY RADIO SHOW OUT IN THE OTHER ROOM AND SAID GIRLS HOLD THE FRONT PAGE WE'RE NOT TALKING POLITICS TODAY WE'RE NOT TALKING SPORT TODAY THEY FOUND ANOTHER MEGAPRIME THE GIRLS JUST SHOOK THEIR
LIKE TRYING TO PUT A SQUARE PEG THROUGH A ROUND HOLE NOW I WASN'T TRYING TO BE SMART I WASN'T TRYING TO BE FUNNY I JUST POLITELY RAISED MY HAND AND WHEN MS RUSSELL ACKNOWLEDGED ME I SAID IN FRONT OF MY YEAR TWO CLASSMATES AND I
IT WAS LIKE SIX BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ARE THE 2 X 3 THAT MULTIPLY TOGETHER TO GIVE US THAT MASSIVE NUMBER WE DIDN'T KNOW FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS
AS WE KNOW THE NUMBER SEVEN IS PRIME THAT FILLS ME WITH ALMOST SEXUAL EXCITEMENT
IN A HUMAN MIND THAT'S WHAT IS SO EXCITING FOR ME ABOUT THIS PRIME NUMBER WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THERE AND WE WENT AND FOUND IT
AGO IN AN AMAZING MOMENT OF SERENDIPITY I HAD TO SEND TED A NEW SLIDE
THAT SCARES SOME PEOPLE THAT EXCITES ME
HOW LUCKY ARE WE TO LIVE IN THIS AGE WHEN MIND AND MACHINE CAN WORK TOGETHER
I WAS ASKED IN AN INTERVIEW LAST YEAR IN MY CAPACITY AS A LOWER CASE C CELEBRITY IN AUSTRALIA
WHAT WAS YOUR HIGHLIGHT OF 2012
WAS THE YEAR I LEFT UNIVERSITY I WAS TORN BETWEEN MATHEMATICS AND MEDIA IT WAS A TOUGH DECISION I LOVED
PRIMES SOMETIMES PROVING ANOTHER NUMBER NOT
AND I RAN OFF DOWN THE STREET MARKED GEEK AS FAST AS MY CHUBBY ASTHMATIC LITTLE LEGS WOULD CARRY ME
SAID TO THE CLASS HEY YEAR TWO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO AFTER LUNCH I'VE GOT NO PLANS IT
WAS AN EXERCISE IN
DEMOCRATIC SCHOOLING
AND I AM ALL FOR DEMOCRATIC SCHOOLING BUT WE WERE ONLY SEVEN
SO SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE MADE AS TO WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO AFTER LUNCH WERE A LITTLE BIT IMPRACTICAL
AND AFTER A WHILE SOMEONE MADE A PARTICULARLY SILLY SUGGESTION AND MS RUSSELL PATTED THEM DOWN WITH THAT GENTLE APHORISM THAT WOULDN'T WORK
YOU TYPED IT OUT ON A COMPUTER AND SAVED IT AS A TEXT FILE THAT'S 22 MEG
FOR THE SLIGHTLY LESS GEEKY OF YOU THINK ABOUT THE HARRY POTTER NOVELS OKAY THIS IS THE FIRST HARRY POTTER NOVEL
THIS IS ALL SEVEN HARRY POTTER NOVELS BECAUSE SHE DID TEND TO FAFF ON A BIT NEAR THE END
TO DRINK THEY CONTINUE TO DANCE THEY HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME BUT AT SOME POINT SHE HAS HAD LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK
AND EMOTIONAL REACTIONS THAT SOCIETY CULTIVATES IN US
TODAY I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU PRECISELY
ABOUT HOW OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS MOLDED
KNOWN IN FEMINIST CIRCLES AS RAPE CULTURE
RAPE CULTURE IS OFTEN DISMISSED AS JUST A PHRASE THAT IS MADE UP BY FANATICAL
WATERS
APPARENTLY SOME WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THERE DEGREES OF RAPE
THIS IS
AN UPDATED VERSION OF A ONCE MEDICALLY SUPPORTED NOTION THAT IT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RAPE A RESISTING WOMAN BECAUSE HER PELVIC AND THIGH MUSCLES WERE CONSIDERED POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO FEND OFF UNWANTED PENETRATION
THE UPDATED VERSION OF THIS LOGIC
IS THAT
RAPE IS MOSTLY RANDOM
LANGUAGE SHAPES THE WAY WE VIEW OUR WORLD LET
US TAKE MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT HOW OUR EVERYDAY LANGUAGE PROMOTES
RAPE CULTURE
THINK ABOUT HOW WE REFER TO WOMEN WHEN ENGAGING IN VERBAL WARFARE
SLUT WHORE BITCH CUNT
OR HOW USING SEXUALLY THREATENING LANGUAGE AGAINST ONE'S SISTER OR MOTHER IS PRETTY MUCH THE NORM
AND SHAMING RAPE CULTURE' AND DEBUNKING THE MYTHS THAT SUSTAIN IT
MEN ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZING THEIR ROLE IN ADDRESSING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND DOING SOME INCREDIBLE WORK TO RAISE AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGE COMMUNITIES TO TAKE ACTION
IN THE UNITED STATES COLLEGES ARE RETHINKING HOW THEY LEGALLY DEFINE CONSENT ON THEIR
OF YOUR DIVERSITY IN THE DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE INCIDENTS I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED IT IS ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION CONDITIONED BY SOCIAL AND
WITHOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE WITH THREAT OF FORCE OR USE OF FORCE AND WITH EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL
YOU ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO REPORT TO THE POLICE YOUR CULTURE MY CULTURE MADE HER FEEL RESPONSIBLE
OF RAPE THAT DOES NOT REEK OF VICTIM BLAMING LANGUAGE STORIES AND IMAGES THAT SUPPORT OR TRIVIALIZE RAPE ARE SO PERVASIVE WE HAVE BECOME
MAYBE THAT IS OK BECAUSE IT WAS NOT YOU AND IT WAS NOT ME RATHER THAN ASKING WHY SHE
WORTHY OF EMPATHY BY BOTH WOMEN AND MEN EVERYWHERE WE LOOK
WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO LINK THE WORD RAPE IN THAT CONTEXT WE KNOW THAT AT ITS CORE OUR SOCIETY DOES NOT OUTWARDLY PROMOTE RAPE
COMFORTABLY
BECAUSE I AM HERE TO MAKE YOU FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE
I AM GOING TO START WITH A STORY
OF A YOUNG WOMAN ABOUT 17 YEARS OLD WHO
HAD JUST COME OUT OF A TRAUMATIC BREAKUP WITH HER BOYFRIEND
AND DECIDED THAT SHE WANTED TO GO OUT AND HAVE REALLY GOOD TIME WITH HER FRIENDS
SO THAT IS WHAT SHE DOES THEY GET READY THEY LOOK GOOD
THERE IS NO OTHER CRIME IN WHICH SO MUCH EFFORT IS EXPENDED TO MAKE THE VICTIM APPEAR RESPONSIBLE
FRIEND'S APARTMENT EVEN THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN A TAXI HOME THIS RAPE WAS IN FACT THE RESULT OF SERIES OF
ABOUT HOW VIOLENCE HAS BECOME SEX AND SEX HAS BECOME VIOLENCE I
AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL CAN MAKE ONE PERSON BECOME A RAPE VICTIM IN THE ABSENCE OF ANOTHER DOING THE RAPING RAPE IS NOT A CHEMICAL REACTION
RAPISTS ARE MONSTERS AND OTHER' IS ACTUALLY SILENCING THE VICTIM BECAUSE THAT MONSTER MIGHT BE SOMEONE SHE LOVED IF WE ARE EVER GOING TO PREVENT RAPE WE NEED
BLURRED LINES INDEED
OR MOVIES THAT FEATURE RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AS THEIR MAIN THEME THEY ARE OSCAR AWARD WINNERS THINK THE ACCUSED OR MORE RECENTLY TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE
RAPE AND ABUSE IS ALSO USED AS USEFUL PLOT TWIST IN SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY RATED SHOWS ON TELEVISION
THINK GAME OF THRONES
PORNOGRAPHY THAT HAS BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM THAN EVER BEFORE
A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
AND SHE STAYS BEHIND WITH HER MALE FRIENDS
WHO ALSO WANTED HER TO STAY BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME
BY THE END OF THE NIGHT
SHE IS COMPLETELY INEBRIATED
SHE GETS UP TO LEAVE
AND HER MALE FRIEND SAYS TO HER DO NOT GO HOME
COME OVER TO MY PLACE
I WILL MAKE YOU COFFEE YOU CAN SOBER UP
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DOES HE TAKES HER HOME TO HIS PLACE HE MAKES HER A COFFEE
BUT SHE IS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT
SHE FALLS ASLEEP
DURING THE COURSE OF THAT NIGHT
HE RAPES HER TWICE
I WILL NOT GET INTO DETAILS
IN THE MORNING SHE WAKES UP TO BANGING ON THE DOOR IT
IS HER FRIEND
WE'RE REALLY DOING HERE IS TAKING THE SAME CONTENT AND THE SAME FORMAT AND BRINGING IT OUT TO MORE
IMPACT WAS ON THE LEARNING AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT WHEN YOU COMBINED THE VIRTUAL LABORATORIES WITH TEACHER LED COACHING AND
THIS FULL POTENTIAL AND SO LASTLY I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH A LITTLE STORY THAT REALLY INSPIRES ME AND THAT IS THE STORY OF JACK ANDRAKA
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY BUT RATHER WITH THE TEACHERS' DECISION TO PUSH FORWARD AND ADOPT THESE TECHNOLOGIES INSIDE THE
THE OTHER GROUP WOULD ONLY USE TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS AND THEY HAD THE SAME AMOUNT OF
THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO REAL LABORATORIES BECAUSE HE WAS TOO INEXPERIENCED
TO BE ALLOWED IN
NOW IMAGINE IF WE COULD BRING IVY LEAGUE MILLION DOLLAR VIRTUAL LABORATORIES OUT TO ALL THESE STUDENTS JUST LIKE JACK
AND THEN IMAGINE HOW THAT WOULD EMPOWER AND INSPIRE A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG AND BRIGHT
COST HEADSET AND NOW WHAT I CAN EFFECTIVELY DO IS I CAN LITERALLY STEP INTO THIS VIRTUAL WORLD WE'LL HAVE SOME OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE ALSO GET TO TRY
SO
A COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK WE STARTED ASKING OURSELVES WE HAVE A WONDERFUL TEAM NOW OF LEARNING PSYCHOLOGISTS AND TEACHERS AND SCIENTISTS AND GAME DEVELOPERS AND WE STARTED ASKING OURSELVES HOW CAN WE KEEP OURSELVES TO OUR PROMISE OF CONSTANTLY REIMAGINING EDUCATION AND TODAY I AM REALLY
LET'S TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT WHY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SCIENCE EDUCATION IS SO VITALLY
SPENT TWO HOURS IN THIS VIRTUAL LAB AND AND I DIDN'T CHECK FACEBOOK
NOW I HOPE THAT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE OF THE
HOW WITHOUT EVEN THINKING TWICE WE BRING
SALT
AND TILL TODAY WHEN AM HUNGRY I DON'T HAVE MICHELIN STARS FANTASIES ABOUT SHAVES OF BELUGA CAVIAR AND WHITE TRUFFLE WHEN I'M HUNGRY I'M THINKING BREAD
BUTTER ONIONS
ITS MAIN INGREDIENTS ARRIVE FROM CHINA AND FROM
95 OF WHEAT CONSUMED IN THIS COUNTRY ARRIVES FROM AUSTRALIA FROM CANADA AND FROM THE STATES SO WE HAVE
ENDLESS STORIES TO DISTRACT MY MIND WHILE SHE FED ME STORIES ABOUT LOKSHALACH WHICH ARE JEWISH NOODLES WHO GET LOST IN THE WOODS AND ABOUT COOKIE SOLDIERS MARCHING IN THE OLD
SO IF WE INSISTED ON USING OUR ECO LOGIC TABOULEH SALAD WOULD PROBABLY BE EXTINCT
SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN
THE TASTE OF OUR MEMORIES
IS TO BRING THE WHOLE WORLD INSIDE OUR PLATES
IT'S TO ALLOW THE WHOLE WORLD TO ENTER OUR KITCHEN
SO IN THIS SENSE AND MAYBE IN THIS SENSE ONLY
GLOBALIZATION ALLOWS US
TO STAY UNIQUE
TO HOLD ON TO A GRANDMOTHER'S KITCHEN
BUT TO ALSO REMEMBER
THAT THERE GRANDMOTHERS
IN CHINA
AND
IN AUSTRALIA
ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUR OWN CHILDHOOD TASTE WE DON'T WANT OUR GRANDCHILDREN TO
THE ASHKENAZ BECOMES CHICKEN SOUP WITH A LOT OF DILL
THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM MAKE THIS GREEN HERBY SOUR TAHINI THAT COULD BE RECOGNIZED FROM MILES AS A JERUSALEM VERSION THOUGH ITS MAIN INGREDIENT SESAME ARRIVES FROM ETHIOPIA
PARSLEY THE RIGHT WAY IS ACTUALLY NOT TO CHOP IT AT ALL IS TO TEAR IT UP WITH YOUR HANDS AND IF YOU DO INSIST OR REALLY NEED TO CHOP IT DO IT ONLY ONE TIME WITH YOUR KNIFE OTHERWISE IT WILL BECOME BLACK AND SOGGY AND LOSE ALL ITS WONDERFUL FRESHNESS
WHAT
OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO OUR EXISTENCE ON THIS PLANET IS THE WAY WE CONSUME AND PRODUCE OUR FOOD SO I WOULD LIKE TO
{NS} I AM OBSESSED WITH FOOD FOR ME EATING IS THE MOST INTIMATE THING IN A SENSE
THE EMOTION THE MEMORY THE INTIMACY THE POWER THE STRENGTH THAT GOES INTO ONE BITE I TAKE IT IS SO STRONG
MY LOVE STORY WITH FOOD BEGINS IN MY CHILDHOOD WHEN I WAS A CHILD
OVER 90 OF GARLIC CONSUMED IN JERUSALEM ARRIVES FROM CHINA IT TRAVELS OVER 5000 MILES IN ORDER TO GET HERE YOU
BEHIND THE CLOSED DOOR OF A KITCHEN
WE DON'T KNOW WHO MADE IT
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS MADE
BUT YET
WE SWALLOW
FOR ME
IT'S AS INTIMATE AS ENTERING A DARK ROOM AND MAKING LOVE WITH SOMEONE I'VE NEVER MET OR TALKED TO IN MY LIFE
BY THE WAY THIS IS WHY OPEN KITCHEN RESTAURANTS BECAME SO POPULAR IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THEY ARE HERE TO STAY
SO FOR ME THE SENTENCE WE ARE WHAT WE EAT
IS A VERY LITERAL ONE
ATTENTION GOES THE REST OF THE BRAIN FOLLOWS IN SOME SENSE IT'S YOUR BRAIN'S BOSS AND OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS I'VE BEEN STUDYING THE HUMAN BRAIN'S ATTENTION SYSTEM IN ALL OF OUR STUDIES
AND WHILE HIS BODY WAS ON THAT BRIDGE HIS MIND HIS ATTENTION WAS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY HE WAS GRIPPED WITH SUFFERING
HIS MIND WAS WORRIED AND PREOCCUPIED AND HAD STRESSFUL MEMORIES AND REALLY DREAD FOR HIS FUTURE AND I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT HE DIDN'T TAKE HIS LIFE
BECAUSE HE AS LEADER KNEW THAT HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS PROBABLY SUFFERING MANY OF HIS FELLOW MARINES PROBABLY WERE TOO
IT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES WE MAKE ERRORS WE MISS CRITICAL INFORMATION SOMETIMES AND WE HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING DECISIONS WHAT'S WORSE IS WHEN WE EXPERIENCE STRESS
THAT WE'VE EVEN GIVEN THIS BRAINWAVE COMPONENT A NAME WE CALL IT THE N170 COMPONENT
AND WE USE THIS COMPONENT IN MANY OF OUR STUDIES IT ALLOWS US TO SEE THE IMPACT THAT ATTENTION MAY HAVE ON OUR PERCEPTION
SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE KIND OF EXPERIMENTS THAT WE
WE SEE A VERY RELIABLE DETECTABLE BRAIN SIGNATURE IT
SO ONE QUESTION WE MIGHT ASK IS WHY DO WE DO THIS WHY DO WE MIND WANDER SO MUCH WELL PART OF THE ANSWER IS
HAPPENING BUT NOT BE GRIPPED BY IT
HE SAID FOR ME THESE WERE THE GIFTS OF MINDFULNESS
AND I WAS SO RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT HE WAS OKAY
BUT REALLY HEARTENED
TO SEE THAT HE HAD TRANSFORMED HIS OWN ATTENTION
HE WENT FROM HAVING A REALLY BAD BOSS AN ATTENTION SYSTEM THAT NEARLY DROVE HIM OFF A BRIDGE
TO ONE THAT WAS AN EXQUISITE LEADER AND GUIDE AND SAVED HIS LIFE
SO I WANT TO END BY SHARING MY CALL TO ACTION
OF A VERY LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH FOR WHOM ATTENTION IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
THINK OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS OR FIREFIGHTERS OR SOLDIERS OR MARINES THIS IS THE STORY OF A MARINE CAPTAIN CAPTAIN JEFF DAVIS
AND THE SCENE THAT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU AS YOU CAN SEE IS NOT ABOUT HIS TIME
WE'LL ASK THEM TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACE AND TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING THAT WE ASK THEM TO TELL US BY PRESSING A BUTTON IF THE FACE APPEARED TO BE MALE FEMALE ON OTHER TRIALS WE ASK THEM TO TELL US WHAT THE SCENE WAS WAS IT INDOOR OR OUTDOOR
PRETTY SOON WE COULD TELL THEY WERE SUCCESSFULLY MIND WANDERING BECAUSE THEY'D PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN THAT FACE WAS UPSIDE DOWN EVEN THOUGH IT'S QUITE PLAIN TO SEE THAT IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN
SO WE WANTED TO KNOW HERE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MIND WANDERING
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT
VERY SIMILAR TO
AND FRANKLY MAY NEVER HAPPEN SO AT THIS POINT YOU MIGHT BE THINKING TO YOURSELF OKAY
THE FACE WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN AND IT WOULD HAPPEN VERY INFREQUENTLY ON THOSE TRIALS THEY WERE TOLD JUST TO WITHHOLD THE
PERCEPTION MAYBE IT WORKS LIKE AN AMPLIFIER AND WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS THAT WHEN WE DIRECT ATTENTION TO THE FACE
IT'S ALSO FRAGILE AND VULNERABLE
AND THINGS LIKE STRESS AND MIND WANDERING DIMINISH ITS POWER
BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE VERY CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTINGS WHAT ABOUT IN THE REAL WORLD WHAT ABOUT IN OUR ACTUAL DAY TO DAY LIFE WHAT ABOUT NOW
WHERE IS YOUR ATTENTION RIGHT NOW
TO BRING IT BACK I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT YOUR ATTENTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY TALK YOU UP FOR IT
HERE'S THE PREDICTION
EMBEDDED IN THEM THESE ELECTRODES PICK UP THE ONGOING BRAIN
YOU HAVE TO EMBODY THIS MINDFUL MODE OF BEING TO HAVE ANY BENEFITS
AND A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE OFFERING PEOPLE PROGRAMS THAT GIVE
OUR PARTICIPANTS A SUITE OF EXERCISES THAT THEY SHOULD DO DAILY IN ORDER TO CULTIVATE MORE MOMENTS OF MINDFULNESS IN THEIR LIFE
AND FOR MANY OF THE GROUPS WE WORK WITH HIGH STRESS GROUPS LIKE I SAID
SOLDIERS
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS
FOR THEM
WE KNOW THAT MIND WANDERING CAN BE REALLY DIRE
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE OFFER THEM VERY ACCESSIBLE
LOW TIME CONSTRAINTS TO OPTIMIZE THE TRAINING SO THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM IT
HIMSELF THE CLARITY OF MIND HE HAD TO NOTICE WHEN THERE WAS FEAR
BUT BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT MINDFULNESS TRAINING IS OR THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW ATTENTION WORKS IN THE BRAIN
WHEN WE'RE IN A MOMENT OF OVERWHELM WE DON'T JUST REFLECT ON THE PAST WHEN WE REWIND WE END UP BEING IN THE PAST RUMINATING RELIVING OR REGRETTING EVENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED
TO US THIS WAS VERY COMPELLING
AND IT ENDED UP THAT CAPTAIN DAVIS AND I THIS WAS ABOUT A DECADE AGO IN 2008 WE'VE KEPT IN TOUCH ALL THESE YEARS
AND HE HIMSELF HAS GONE ON TO CONTINUE PRACTICING MINDFULNESS IN A DAILY WAY
HE WAS PROMOTED
TO MAJOR HE ACTUALLY THEN ENDED UP RETIRING FROM THE MARINE CORPS
HE WENT ON
TO GET A DIVORCE TO GET REMARRIED TO HAVE A CHILD TO GET AN MBA AND
THROUGH ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES AND
THE BRAIN IS A HIGHLY EFFICIENT ENERGY DEMANDING ORGAN THAT GETS FULLY UTILIZED AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS AT FULL CAPACITY BEING USED IT SUFFERS FROM A
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING THAT BUTTON RIGHT ON PLAY TO EXPERIENCE THE MOMENT TO MOMENT UNFOLDING OF OUR
UPON THEIR RETURN CAPTAIN DAVIS SHARED WITH US WHAT HE WAS
FEELING WAS THE BENEFIT OF THIS PROGRAM
HE SAID THAT UNLIKE LAST TIME
AFTER THIS DEPLOYMENT THEY WERE MUCH MORE PRESENT
THEY WERE DISCERNING THEY
THOUGH JUST LIKE THE OTHER GROUPS
OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR GROUP
THEY WERE EXPERIENCING HIGH STRESS
AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IS THAT IF PEOPLE TAKE OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS OVER LET'S SAY EIGHT WEEKS
AND THEY FULLY COMMIT TO DOING THE DAILY MINDFULNESS EXERCISES THAT ALLOW THEM TO LEARN HOW TO BE IN THE
AND I WANT TO JUST BRING IT BACK TO CAPTAIN JEFF DAVIS AS I MENTIONED TO YOU AT THE BEGINNING HIS MARINES WERE INVOLVED IN THE VERY FIRST
SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF GLIMPSE INTO HOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS A VERY POIGNANT EXAMPLE OF
OR A SURGEON OR FIREFIGHTER MISSING ANY TIME THE CONSEQUENCES IN THOSE CASES COULD BE
STRESS AND EXTERNAL DISTRACTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT INTERNAL
OF HIS LIFE HE KEPT UP WITH HIS MINDFULNESS PRACTICE AND AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT
SERIES OF ATTENTION TESTS WE TRACK THEIR ATTENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF SOME KIND OF HIGH STRESS INTERVAL
AND THEN TWO MONTHS LATER WE TRACK THEM AGAIN AND WE WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IS THERE ANY BENEFIT OF OFFERING THEM MINDFULNESS TRAINING CAN WE PROTECT AGAINST THE LAPSES IN ATTENTION THAT MIGHT ARISE OVER HIGH STRESS
MIND WANDERING'S HAPPENING A LOT
OFTEN IT HAPPENS WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS
AND UNDER STRESS IT'S EVEN WORSE WE MIND WANDER MORE POWERFULLY AND MORE OFTEN IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY DO ABOUT THIS
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE ANSWER IS YES
FROM OUR WORK WE'RE LEARNING THAT THE OPPOSITE OF A STRESSED AND WANDERING MIND
BUT A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE SUGGESTS
THAT WE MIND WANDER WE TAKE OUR MIND AWAY FROM THE TASK AT HAND ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF OUR WAKING MOMENTS
THESE MIGHT BE SMALL LITTLE TRIPS THAT WE TAKE AWAY PRIVATE THOUGHTS THAT WE HAVE
AND WHEN THIS MIND WANDERING HAPPENS
IT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC NOW I DON'T THINK
AND THEY DO IT WITH MILLISECOND TEMPORAL PRECISION
IN ON THIS BIG QUESTION I WANTED TO KNOW THREE THINGS FIRST
HOW DOES ATTENTION CONTROL OUR PERCEPTION
SECOND WHY DOES IT FAIL US OFTEN LEAVING US FEELING FOGGY AND DISTRACTED
AND THIRD CAN WE DO
WE EVER DID OFFERING MINDFULNESS TRAINING AND THEY SHOWED THIS EXACT PATTERN WHICH WAS VERY HEARTENING WE HAD OFFERED THEM THE MINDFULNESS TRAINING RIGHT BEFORE THEY WERE
AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S NOT AS STREAMLINED AS MANY STORIES THAT YOU MIGHT USUALLY HEAR BUT NEITHER IT IS A STORY THAT TAKES SO MUCH OF ITS
BUT IT IS A FUNDAMENTALIST CHURCH THAT BELIEVES IN THE LITERAL TRUTH OF THE BIBLE
IN OTHER WORDS
ADAM AND EVE WERE VERY REAL
THEY LIVED IN A GARDEN EVE TALKED TO SNAKE
EVE ATE THE
APPLE EVE GAVE THE APPLE TO ADAM AND ADAM GOT THE ROTTEN DEAL
AND THAT ALSO MEANS THAT NOAH BUILT AN ARK WITH HIS OWN TWO HANDS
THAT HE
SOMEWHAT SINGLE HANDEDLY SAVED
ALL OF HUMANITY AND ALL OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM FROM EXTINCTION HOWEVER A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT
AND THE BROCHURE SAID LOVE IN ACTION
I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP I HAVE THE DOCUMENTS TO PROVE IT
IT SAID LOVE IN ACTION AND IT HAD ALL OF THESE REALLY SMILING HAPPY PEOPLE ON THE FRONT OF IT
AND WHEN WE STARTED TO FLIP THROUGH IT IT HAD WORDS THAT SAID THINGS LIKE
SINCE COMING TO LOVE IN ACTION I'VE LEARNED THAT I CAN NOW BE WITH MY FAMILY SIN FREE AND SINCE COMING TO LOVE IN ACTION I CAN NOW HAVE THE DREAM OF REAL STRAIGHT
FAMILY
AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE LOOKED 100 STRAIGHT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
I CAN'T DO THIS AND I SAID TO MY DAD
I REALLY DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER GOING TO BE A MOMENT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK SO
AND
SO HE SAID
OK LET'S GO SEE THE PASTOR BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS NOT A FULLY ORDAINED PASTOR WE STILL HAD TO RELY ON OUR OWN AND OUR OWN CHURCH FAMILY
AND SO WE WENT TO SEE THE PASTOR
AND HE SAT US DOWN IN HIS OFFICE AND WE EXPLAINED THE WHOLE THING AND HE SAID HEY
YOU'RE LUCKY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CASE OF HOMOSEXUALITY IN THE CHURCH IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT
IDEAS WERE I JUST WILL SHOW IT TO YOU IF YOU WANT TO COME BY AND LOOK AT IT AND HAVE A LITTLE LAUGH SO DOES THAT SOUND GOOD OK THAT'S IT THANKS BYE
BOTH KNEW SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE KNEW WHICH WAS THAT I WAS GAY
CAN I POSSIBLY SAY THAT WON'T SOUND
COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO AIR OUT ALL OF THIS BAD STUFF THAT'S BEEN BOTTLED UP INSIDE OF YOU AND THEN ASK FOR FORGIVENESS AND THE GROUP SORT OF HELPS YOU COME TO TERMS WITH THAT AND AS I BEGAN TO SORT OF TRY TO STRING TOGETHER SOME SORT
OF NARRATIVE YOU KNOW MOST OF MY EXPERIENCES HAD JUST BEEN LOOKING AT UNDERWEAR ADS
AND
SO WHEN I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS
THE LITERATURE PART OF MY BRAIN IS JUST LIKE
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE RIGHT
AND IT WASN'T AS IF FAITH HAD ALWAYS COME EASY FOR ME
I'D PRAYED ON MY KNEES FOR YEARS TRYING TO CHANGE MYSELF BUT IN THAT MOMENT I KEPT THINKING OF HESTER PRYNNE
AND HOW EVERYONE KEPT TELLING HER THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER WOULD ONE DAY BE REWARDED IN HEAVEN
SO EVERYBODY IN THAT TOWN IN THAT BOOK WAS SAYING LIKE IF YOU JUST GO THROUGH ALL THIS STUFF YOU'LL BE BETTER IN
THE END AND
SO
YOU KNOW
DAYS CONTINUED AND LET ME TELL YOU A FEW OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY HAD ME DO THEY HAD ME DO THIS THING CALLED A GENOGRAM
WHICH IF ANY OF YOU KNOW PSYCHOLOGY IS LIKE WHERE YOU PUT
A FAMILY TREE ON A CHART
AND NEXT TO PEOPLE'S NAMES THEY WANTED ME TO PUT THINGS LIKE
H FOR HOMOSEXUALITY
A FOR ADULTERY AB FOR ABORTION A DOLLAR SIGN FOR GAMBLING
AND THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO
REPRESENT THE BIBLE VERSE THAT SAYS THAT THE SINS OF THE FATHERS TRICKLE DOWN
TO THE SONS RIGHT SO THE MORE SINS YOU HAVE IN YOUR FAMILY TREE THE MORE LIKELY IT IS YOU'LL TURN OUT TOTALLY GAY
THAT'S THE LOGIC OF THE CAMP
SO WATCH OUT
LITERATURE PART OF MY BRAIN WAS THINKING LIKE
THAT
MAY BE SUCKY STORY BUT IT'S MY STORY AND YOU CAN'T JUST RIP IT ALL OUT AND THEN THE GOD PART OF MY BRAIN WAS LIKE WELL I'M DOING THIS FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS AND I WANT TO STAY WITH MY FAMILY I WANT YOU KNOW TO BE A GOOD
GOD FEARING CHRISTIAN WITH A NICE WIFE AND ALL THAT STUFF
AND
SO WHEN I WENT INTO THE GROUP
WHICH WAS ACTUALLY COMPOSED OF PEOPLE DEALING WITH ANYTHING FROM
HOMOSEXUALITY OF COURSE
BESTIALITY
PEDOPHILIA
AND
ANY OTHER SORT OF INFIDELITY THAT ANYONE HAD ENGAGED IN
AND SO I'M SITTING IN THIS GROUP IT'S LIKE A SEMICIRCLE
AND THEN THEY ASK ME TO GET UP AND
IN LOVE
WITH IT YOU KNOW IT FELT LIKE SOMEONE HAD JUST TAKEN THE TOP OF MY HEAD OFF AND JUST REARRANGED ALL THE FURNITURE THAT HAD BEEN THERE
FOR 18 YEARS
AND
YOU KNOW I FELT LIKE I HAD TWO BRAINS
SUDDENLY I FELT LIKE I HAD THIS REALLY MESSY LITERATURE BASED NON BLACK AND WHITE BRAIN
AND THEN I HAD THE GOD BRAIN
THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP IT WAS THIS CLEAN NICE VERSION OF MYSELF
THOU SHALT NOT LIE WITH MANKIND
VERY
LITERALLY
AND SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE KINDS OF COMPLICATIONS THAT THIS BROUGHT ON
BUT LUCKILY THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A FULLY ORDAINED PREACHER TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME
SO MY MOTHER AND I IN OUR SCHEMING
DECIDED OK HOW ARE WE GOING TO TELL HIM LIKE WE'VE GOT TO WAIT A LONG TIME UNTIL IT'S THE EXACT RIGHT MOMENT AND IT TURNS OUT THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT A RIGHT MOMENT FOR THIS SORT
OF THING
AND SO ONE NIGHT WHEN WE COULDN'T HANDLE IT ANYMORE
WE JUST TOLD HIM WE WERE LIKE
OK GARRARD THINKS HE MIGHT BE GAY
THAT WAS WHAT
WHEN IT SAYS THOU SHALT NOT LIE WITH MANKIND AS WITH WOMANKIND
DISCLAIMER IT IS OK FOR YOU TO LAUGH DURING ANY POINT OF THIS PRESENTATION YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY SOON SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A
ME TELL A FEW THINGS THAT THEY DID ON THE FIRST DAY
SO AFTER YOU SIGN YOUR NAME IN THE LEDGER
THEY GO THROUGH YOUR POCKETS
YOUR PHONE ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU TO THE CAMP
THEY LOOK FOR WHAT'S CALLED FALSE IMAGES
SO A FALSE IMAGE IS ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO STOP YOU FROM BECOMING COMPLETELY STRAIGHT
SO I'D WRITTEN A SHORT STORY IN ONE OF MY NOTEBOOKS AND I THOUGHT LIKE WHY WOULDN'T I BRING THIS SHORT STORY TO THE CAMP IT'LL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO WHEN I'M BORED RIGHT IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS A FALSE IMAGE
SO THEY RIPPED THE PAGES OUT
OF MY NOTEBOOK WADDED IT INTO A BALL AND THREW IT IN A TRASH
CAN
AND IN THAT MOMENT I BEGAN TO HAVE THE FIRST OF MANY DOUBTS
SO
MY FATHER BECAME A MISSIONARY BAPTIST PREACHER
ON THAT DAY MY MOTHER AND I WERE IN CHURCH
AND
YOU KNOW IT WAS SORT OF EXPECTED BECAUSE WE HAD GONE TO CHURCH
THREE TIMES WEEK
EVERY WEEK SINCE THE MOMENT THAT I COULD ACTUALLY GO TO CHURCH
AND SO FOR MY FATHER THIS WAS A VERY NATURAL STEP
BUT THERE
WAS SOMETHING THAT MY MOTHER AND I WERE NOT
EXPECTING WHICH WAS THE SIGHT OF HIM WALKING UP THE AISLE AND CRYING AND SHAKING AND ASKING BETWEEN HIS SOBS
FOR GOD TO FORGIVE HIM OF ALL OF HIS SINS SO THAT HE COULD BECOME A FULL TIME PREACHER
AND AS MY MOM AND I HAD TO STAND UP ON THE STAGE
BESIDE HIM AND RECEIVE ALL THESE HUGS FROM ALL THESE REALLY NICE PEOPLE THAT WERE
AND THE EX GAY COUNSELORS THAT TRIED TO TURN ME STRAIGHT
FOR TEN YEARS I DIDN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO THEM YOU KNOW I JUST HATED THEM
AND THEN SUDDENLY I READ ALL THESE ARTICLES ABOUT THIS MAN
JOHN SMITH WHO HAD RUN THE WHOLE THING WHO WAS APOLOGIZING FOR WHAT HE'D DONE AND BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS
AND IN THAT MOMENT
IT TESTED THE VERY FOUNDATION OF WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE COMPASSION
BECAUSE I WAS JUST LIKE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FORGIVE THIS KIND OF PERSON YOU KNOW
AND I DON'T THINK I FULLY HAVE
BUT WE ARE FACEBOOK FRIENDS
AND IT
ONLY GETS MESSIER BUT I FEEL LIKE
IT'S WITHIN THE MESS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR COMPASSION
YOU KNOW WITHOUT THE MESS MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW MUCH SHE LOVED ME MY FATHER WOULD HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW
HE HAD TO GROW AND HOW MUCH I HAD TO GROW
AND IT'S WITHIN THAT MESS THAT WE REALLY SAW SORT OF BIBLICAL COMPASSION COME ABOUT
AND YOU
KNOW I WANT TO KIND OF EXTEND THAT TO A MORE GENERAL IDEA WHICH IS THAT THE WORLD SEEMS REALLY ABSURD FREQUENTLY LIKE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
LOOK AT THE BIGGEST HEADLINES EVERY DAY
IT SEEMS REALLY ABSURD AND SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO EVEN GET OUT
OF BED BUT YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A GOD
GOD MADE THIS MESS
AND
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP TESTING THE LIMITS OF OUR COMPASSION AND KEEP DEVELOPING THAT BECAUSE
YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A HEAVEN NOBODY CLEANS THEIR ROOMS UP THERE
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHERE IT IS THAT'S WHERE THE MESS IS SO THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT FOR YOU TODAY
BECAUSE APPARENTLY I HADN'T HAD ENOUGH MALE TO MALE CONTACT IN MY
LIFE
AND SO BECAUSE I'D MISSED OUT ON THAT I'D SOMEHOW STARTED IDOLIZING MEN'S BODIES
THEY HAD ME CONTINUALLY DO WHAT'S CALLED THE MORAL INVENTORY WHICH WAS EXPLAIN ALL OF THE BAD THOUGHTS THAT I EVER HAD IN FRONT OF
THE GROUP ATTACH BIBLE VERSE TO IT AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT
IT
SO
AS THESE WEEKS PASSED YOU
KNOW I WAS SORT OF BUYING IT SORT OF NOT BUYING IT GOING BACK AND FORTH AND IT JUST FELT
AT SOME POINT
LIKE WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO ME WAS THE VERY OPPOSITE OF LOVE REMEMBER THEIR NAME WAS LOVE IN ACTION
AND IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
THAT
AND I WAS ACTUALLY SITTING ACROSS FROM AN EMPTY CHAIR
BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO IMAGINE MY FATHER SITTING THERE
AND THE COUNSELORS WERE SAYING YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER HAS OBVIOUSLY DAMAGED YOU
THIS HAS RUINED YOUR LIFE IT'S MADE YOU WHO YOU ARE THIS SINFUL PERSON THEY SAID THE MORE THAT YOU CAN GET
AND SO WHEN WE GOT IN THE CAR SHE DROVE US OFF WE WERE GOING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SHE SAID ONE THING WHICH WAS
ARE YOU GOING TO KILL YOURSELF
DIRECT AGAIN AND
I
SAID YES BECAUSE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT LIKE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S GOING TO GET ME OUT OF HERE AND ALSO I SORT OF FELT LIKE IT AT THE
TIME
AND SO SHE DECIDED AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS MUCH BETTER TO HAVE A GAY SON THAN A DEAD ONE
AND SO WE WENT BACK AND YOU KNOW
ALL OF THAT HAPPENED
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU EVERY DETAIL
OF WHAT OCCURRED SINCE THEN BECAUSE IT'S VERY CONVOLUTED HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A TOTAL MESS
RIGHT YOU KNOW MY MOTHER AND I TALKED IT OUT WE EVENTUALLY GOT ON GOOD TERMS WITH ONE ANOTHER
MY FATHER AND I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S PRETTY BURIED IN THE PAST FOR US HOWEVER WE EXCHANGE POETRY VOLUMES REGULARLY LIKE I GIVE HIM POETRY AND HE GIVES ME POETRY WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD
MOM SAID
VERY DIRECT
AND SO IN THAT MOMENT MY FATHER STOOD UP FROM HIS RECLINER AND HE TOOK ME INTO THE BEDROOM CLOSED THE DOOR SAID SIT DOWN
AND I WAS LIKE OH GOD WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT WAS LITERALLY OH GOD BECAUSE I WAS PRAYING AT THAT MOMENT
AND SO AT THIS MOMENT MY FATHER SAID THESE WORDS THAT I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE ABLE TO ERASE FROM MY BRAIN
WHICH WERE YOU KNOW IF I WAS EVER GOING TO BE STRAIGHT HE JUST RUINED THE CHANCES BECAUSE HE SAID
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE INSIDE WOMAN
THE BIBLE BUT ENOUGH OF A PRELUDE I'LL LET YOU HEAR FOR YOURSELVES WHEN I WAS
WE SAW THE FIRST DIALYSIS MACHINE IN 1960 WE SAW A BURMESE
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON USE A PIECE OF IVORY TO REPLACE THE HIP OF AN 83 YEAR
OLD BUDDHIST NUN
IN 1967 WE SAW THE FIRST HEART TRANSPLANTATION FIRST ARTIFICIAL HEART CAME LATER ARTIFICIAL KNEE YOU
NAME
IT
NOW TO SAY FROM SCRATCH IS BIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE THE REAL TISSUE ENGINEERS ARE THE CELLS
AND SO AS TISSUE ENGINEERS WE HAVE A BIT OF AN IDENTITY CRISIS BECAUSE THE CELLS THEMSELVES ARE THE ONES DOING ALL THE WORK
BECAUSE THERE WAS A SHIFT PHILOSOPHICALLY FROM THE IDEA OF LET'S BUILD A HIP
TO
LET'S BUILD AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE A FANCY FISH TANK SO TO SPEAK WE CALL THEM BIOREACTORS THAT ALLOW CELLS
TO BUILD A PIECE OF BONE THEMSELVES
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT AND MAKES WORKING AS A TISSUE ENGINEER REALLY FUN AND
TO MARKET AND
YOU KNOW THE LATER THE DRUGS FAIL IN THIS PROCESS THE MORE EXPENSIVE AND THE MORE POTENTIALLY DAMAGING
IT IS BUT WHAT IF WE COULD USE SOME OF THOSE PIECES OF ENGINEERED TISSUE TO SERVE AS SUBSTITUTES
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR ANIMAL TESTING AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR HUMAN TESTING
IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO TWO ISSUES ONE IS THAT WE ARE NOT RATS AND I'M FROM NEW YORK SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
BUT WE USE RATS BECAUSE THEY'RE WHOLE ORGANISMS AND THEY GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW DRUGS MIGHT ACT IN THE BODY
AND SECONDLY AS EXQUISITELY SIMILAR AS WE ALL ARE TO EACH OTHER THOSE TINY DIFFERENCES IN OUR DNA ACTUALLY MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE WITH HOW WE METABOLIZE DRUGS AND HOW THE DRUGS AFFECT US
SO IF WE CAN USE THESE TISSUE ENGINEERED MODELS TO
BECAME THIS IDEA OF BODY 3 0 SO WE'VE
OK SO THAT'S ENGINEERING HEALTHY HUMAN TISSUES BUT WHAT IF WE COULD ENGINEER TISSUES THAT REPLICATE A DISEASED STATE
KEVIN
EGGAN FROM HARVARD IS DOING JUST THAT TAKING CELLS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE GENES FOR
ALS LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE HE'S ABLE TO GROW NEURONS OUT OF THOSE CELLS
AND THOSE CELLS ACT IN THE LAB SIMILARLY TO
HOW ALS PATIENTS ACT IN
REAL LIFE SO IF WE CAN BEGIN TO
GROW MORE OF THESE DISEASED TISSUES IN THE LAB WE CAN ALSO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT DISEASE MECHANISMS AND HOPEFULLY DISEASE
OF
TISSUE MATCHING AND OF TISSUE VIABILITY
AND BY BEING ABLE TO CULTURE
HUMAN TISSUE SUBSTITUTES THAT ARE EITHER HEALTHY OR REPRESENTING DISEASED STATES WE CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A MUCH MORE CONCRETE WAY AND WITH MANY DATA POINTS THAN WE EVER COULD BEFORE ABOUT HOW DRUGS WILL AFFECT
HUMAN
BEINGS
AND THE FACT THAT THIS ALL IS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME THERE'RE SISTER REVOLUTIONS HAPPENING IN MANUFACTURING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT
3D PRINTING OPEN HARDWARE OPEN SOFTWARE PLATFORMS NEW COLLABORATION TOOLS
THAT IS SO EXCITING TO US AND MAKES FOR EVEN MORE INTERESTING COLLABORATIONS GOING FORWARD
AS
A RESEARCHER HAVING SO MUCH FUN IN THIS FIELD I INVITE YOU TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT WHERE YOU THINK THE BODY 4 0 IS GOING TO BE
FORBID ANY OF US GETS THAT PHONE CALL THAT SAYS THAT EITHER YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS CANCER BUT WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW A SPECIFIC DRUG ACTS ON YOUR SPECIFIC CANCER OR ON MY SPECIFIC CANCER KAREN BURG'S LAB IS DOING JUST THAT USING INKJET TECHNOLOGY TO PRINT BREAST CANCER CELLS IN DISH AND COLLABORATORS OF OURS AT TUFTS ARE USING MODELS LIKE THESE WITH TISSUE ENGINEERED BONES TO STUDY HOW CANCER COULD SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE BODY YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THOSE CHIPS WE JUST LOOKED AT ON THE LAST SLIDE
COULD BE THE NEXT GENERATION OF THAT WHERE WE HAVE CANCER AND TISSUES CULTURED TOGETHER
SINGLE PIECES OF TISSUE A SINGLE HEART LIVER ALL OF THAT BUT IMAGINE I MEAN
GETTING BACK TO THE RAT THE RAT IS A WHOLE ORGANISM AND AS WE KNOW IF I TAKE A MEDICINE FOR MY BLOOD PRESSURE IT AFFECTS NOT ONLY MY VASCULATURE BUT ALSO IT MIGHT AFFECT MY LIVER AN ANTIDEPRESSANT THAT I TAKE MIGHT GET METABOLIZED AND THEN GET STORED IN MY FAT TISSUE
WHAT RESEARCHERS ARE STARTING TO DO NOW IS TO ENGINEER MICROSCALE MICROFLUIDIC CULTURES ON WHICH TINY PIECES OF HEART LIVER LUNG GUT ARE ALL ON THE SAME PLATFORM AND SO WE CAN BEGIN TO STUDY THESE INTERACTIONS
THIS FIELD IS JUST BEGINNING SO STAY
HEART CELLS KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT CELLS DON'T NEED VERY MUCH TO UNDERSTAND AND TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST THEY JUST NEEDED THE RIGHT FOOD THEY NEEDED
PIECES OF TISSUE AND FORM A FUNCTIONAL HEART OUT OF THAT BUT THAT'S IN THE FUTURE WHAT CAN WE DO NOW WELL THIS IS A VIDEO OF A PIECE OF ENGINEERED TISSUE THAT I ENGINEERED DURING MY PHD
TRAGIC ACCIDENT SHE FELL SHATTERING HER PATELLA WHICH IS HER
KNEECAP
THEY WERE
ABLE TO REBUILD HER KNEE SURGEONS WERE ABLE TO REBUILD HER KNEE FROM A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SOURCES SHE GOT A DONOR PATELLA SHE HAD A PIECE OF HER HAMSTRING FASHIONED INTO TWO LIGAMENTS SHE HAD TWO BIOPOLYMER LIGAMENTS AND METAL BUMPERS TO HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER
SHE CAN WALK AND NOW NOT ONLY THAT I MEAN SHE PLAYS BASKETBALL SOFTBALL GYMNASTICS YOU NAME IT
AND IF YOU ASK HER SHE WILL SAY SHE IS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT SHE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS
BUT SHE'S VERY OPINIONATED AND WHAT SHE'LL ALSO TELL YOU IS THAT GOING FORWARD SHE DOESN'T IMAGINE THAT KNEES WILL EVER BE REPAIRED IN THIS WAY
SHE IMAGINES
THAT SHE COULD GROW HER OWN CARTILAGE GROW HER OWN LIGAMENTS GROW HER OWN BONE ALL FROM HER OWN CELLS
SHE PLANS TO PARTICIPATE IN
THAT AS WELL
WE'LL GET TO THAT LITTLE BIT LATER
BUT I THOUGHT LET'S REVISIT THAT IDEA LET'S VISIT THAT IDEA
OF
HOW THAT WILL COME TO BEING
SO WHERE DID IT ALL BEGIN
BODY
AND HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOME BREAST CANCER CELLS THAT WERE
KNOWLEDGE FROM TRANSPLANTATION SCIENCE THE IDEA OF GROWING
IN THIS CASE COLLAGEN AND THEY NEEDED SOME BIOPHYSICAL CUES IN THIS CASE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS
BONES YOU MIGHT IMAGINE ARE MECHANICALLY ACTIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING YOU SEE A LOT OF MECHANICAL LOADING BUT IN THIS CASE
WITH FOOD AND A PACEMAKER CURRENT THE
WITH A PART FROM A DONOR OR PART MADE BY HUMANS
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS AND ALANA WILL TELL YOU IS THAT THERE'S SCAR TISSUE WHENEVER YOU PUT ANYTHING INSIDE THE BODY
THE BODY SORT OF TREATS IT AS AN INVADER AND BEGINS TO ATTACK IT AND SO THESE KIND OF IMPLANTS LED TO A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING WORK WITH CELLS AND WITH BIOMATERIALS TO TRY AND STUDY THE INTERACTIONS OF THINGS THAT WERE PUT INSIDE THE BODY AND WHAT HAPPENED
AT SCHOOL WHERE WE TALK ABOUT LOVE
CONSTANTLY
WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION IN LOVE
WE TALK ABOUT
THE POWER THAT FORGIVENESS PROVIDES IN THE CONTEXT OF LOVE AND WE TALK ABOUT THE REALITY OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN LOVE
LOVE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS
LOVE EMBOLDENS THEM TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THINGS THAT WE'VE NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO MAKE THEIR DREAMS BECOME A REALITY LOVE STARTS
ALL OF THAT
SO WHERE
DOES THAT LOVE BEGIN
WELL BILL HOOKS TOLD US THAT THE CLASSROOM REMAINS THE MOST RADICAL SPACE OF POSSIBILITY THAT POSSIBILITY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE LOVE OF TEACHERS
AND I KNOW YOU'D PROBABLY LOVE FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT LOVE SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT'S
WONDERFUL WHEN THAT HAPPENS BUT THAT IS NOT THE CONSISTENT LIFE OF AN EDUCATOR
WE HAVE CHILDREN THAT COME TO US AND THEY'RE BROKEN
AND THEY'RE IN NEED AND THEY NEED LOVE BECAUSE
THAT SHE THOUGHT ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE AND IT REMINDED ME IT GALVANIZED ME THAT DAY THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT I FELT WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD AND I KNEW THAT SHE LOVED ME AND SHE REMINDED ME AGAIN WITH THE
TO WORK WITH TEACHERS AND I GET TO BE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE
AND
I HEAR A DING ON MY COMPUTER AND I TURN AROUND AND IT'S AN EMAIL FROM MISS MCCARTHY
TELLING ME HOW SHE HAD FOLLOWED ME AND HOW
SHE WAS SO PROUD OF ME AND THAT SHE KNEW THAT I WOULD CONSISTENTLY CONTINUE TO
SIGNED WITH LOVE THANK YOU {NS}
PRINCIPAL WHO I SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE AFTERNOON IN
NO I FELL IN LOVE WITH MISS MCCARTHY MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER
IT WAS HER PATIENCE WITH MY STUTTER IT WAS THE WAY THAT SHE PUT UP WITH MY INCESSANT QUESTIONING
AND THE WAY THAT WE BUILT THAT RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WHERE I FELT LIKE I COULD DO ANYTHING
SO THAT BEGAN A LIFETIME OF EDUCATOR SERIAL MONOGAMY
TODAY IS ABOUT LOVE
MORE SPECIFICALLY
THE LOVE OF TEACHERS
LOVING TEACHERS IS THE SINGLE BEST THING THAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR SOCIETY
NOW BEFORE YOU RUSH OUT GRAB A TEACHER AND TRY TO TAKE A LONG WALK ON THE BEACH
YOU WANT SAFE COMMUNITY
LOVE TEACHERS
YOU WANT A MORE PROSPEROUS ECONOMY LOVE TEACHERS YOU WANT MORE INFORMED ELECTORATE AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE TEACHERS
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD
LOVE TEACHERS
THAT SOUNDS SIMPLE IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS AND IT SOUNDS IDEALISTIC BUT IT'S REALISTIC
IT IS PRAGMATIC
IF YOU DID A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS TO GET TO THE WHY
OF MOST EDUCATORS IT COMES BACK TO A BASAL LOVE
OF LEARNING
AND PROVIDING THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR KIDS
LOVE DRIVES US ALL
AND IT ALWAYS HAS
AND IT CERTAINLY DID ME SO
FAST FORWARD
TO
THAT SAME ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH WAS MY FIRST PRINCIPALSHIP
AND
THAT
SAME PLAYGROUND WHERE LET'S FACE IT I KISSED THE GIRL
WHAT CHALLENGES THEM LOVE IS WHAT HELPS THEM STAY FOCUSED ON HIGH EXPECTATIONS
LIKE YOU TO SHARE THEM WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SHOW YOU THE WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GET COPY OF THE TIPS SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT TAKING NOTES
REDUCE YOUR RISK OF EARLY MEMORY LOSS AND THE GOOD NEWS IS EVERYTHING THAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S EASY IT'S FREE AND YOU CAN DO IT STARTING TODAY SO WITHOUT
A FURTHER ADO I WILL TALK ABOUT THE FIRST TIP THE FIRST TIP AND IF YOU WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING ELSE JUST WALK AWAY WITH THIS ONE FAST WALKING IS FANTASTIC FOR YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR HEART SO
STUDY THEY TRACKED 600078 NUNS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES AND A LOT OF THE NUNS EVEN GAVE PERMISSION THAT UPON THEIR DEATH THEY COULD BE AUTOPSIED THEY OPENED UP THEIR BRAINS TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WHAT THE CORRELATION IS WITH ALZHEIMER'S THEY FOUND THAT THE NUNS WHO HAD THE HIGHEST USAGE OF POSITIVE EMOTION WORDS SO THE HIGHEST POSITIVE OUTLOOK NOT ONLY AGED BETTER AND LIVED LONGER AND LIVED HEALTHIER LIVES BUT ALSO WHAT WAS REALLY STARTLING WAS IN A FEW CASES WHEN THEY OPENED UP THE BRAINS OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEY LOOKED INSIDE THERE WERE TANGLES AND PLAQUES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ALZHEIMER'S
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SYMPTOMS
THAT ARE OF ALZHEIMER'S SO THERE'S THIS NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT TO POSITIVE OUTLOOK THAT IS REALLY REALLY GREAT AND SCIENTISTS ARE GOING TO NEED TO STUDY IT BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THERE THE THING THAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF IS ELIMINATE YOUR NEGATIVE SELF TALK
TALK BACK TO IT YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE SO TALK BACK TO IT GET RID OF YOUR NEGATIVE FRIENDS REPLACE THEM WITH MORE POSITIVE
COMPONENT EVEN BETTER SO LEARN BALLROOM DANCING WHAT'S FUNNY IS YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE GOOD AT IT AT ALL SO YOU CAN TRY TAE BO DANCING FLAMENCO GUITAR IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER YOU'RE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS THAN WHAT YOU USUALLY DO DURING THE DAY SO YOUR BRAIN IS GROWING NEW NEURAL CONNECTIONS AND IT'S JUST FANTASTIC FOR YOU
THIRD TIP
AVOID POISONS EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT LEAD IN SMOKING WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT SMOKING IN MIDLIFE DOUBLES THE RATE OF DEMENTIA LATER AND WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT
EVEN AN OCCASIONAL CIGARETTE THE SOCIAL CIGARETTE OR SOCIAL CIGAR CAUSES YOUR CAPILLARIES TO ACT LIKE THEY'RE BEING POISONED BECAUSE GUESS WHAT THEY'RE BEING POISONED
YOU
WANT
TO AVOID THAT YOU ALSO WANT TO AVOID THE
JURY'S OUT ON ALUMINUM THEY DON'T KNOW IF THESE THINGS ARE INCONCLUSIVE BUT IF YOU CAN AVOID IT PLEASE DO YOU ALSO WANT
TO AVOID TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE THERE'S A WEBSITE CALLED COSMETICSDATABASE COM AND YOU CAN LITERALLY PUT IN YOUR SHAMPOO YOUR TOOTHPASTE YOUR SOAP YOUR MAKEUP YOUR SUNSCREEN AND ALL OF YOUR CLEANING PRODUCTS AND IT POPS OUT HOW TOXIC IT IS ON A SCALE TO ONE TO TEN AND YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S TOXIC AND WHAT'S A SAFER ALTERNATIVE TO THE THINGS YOU'RE USING
FORTH TIP
BEING SOCIAL IS INCREDIBLY GOOD FOR YOU THERE'S HARVARD STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE FIVE SOCIAL TIES
SO YOU CAN PLAY CHESS YOU CAN PLAY BRIDGE YOU CAN LEARN A NEW INSTRUMENT A COMPLICATED DANCE OR LANGUAGE
IS
THOSE ARE PEANUTS AND BEANS
AND THERE'S A REAL SOCIAL COMPONENT TO THE MEDITERRANEAN VILLAGE DIET AS WELL SO THE LAST TIP THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU IS THAT POSITIVE OUTLOOK MATTERS AND IT MATTERS A LOT IF YOU
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT
TRUE DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK ONLY 5 TO 8 OF ALZHEIMER'S IS LINKED TO A SINGLE GENE TO BEGIN WITH
THERE IS STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TWO IDENTICAL TWINS
AND ONE GETS ALZHEIMER'S THEY'RE IDENTICAL TWINS YOU EXPECT THE OTHER ONE TO GET ALZHEIMER'S 100 OF THE TIME THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN 21 OF THE TIME THE OTHER TWIN DOESN'T GET ALZHEIMER'S OR GETS IT SO MUCH LATER THAT IT'S UNRELATED TO THAT GENETIC BASIS
SO I'M HERE TO
PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE HALF THE RATE OF COGNITIVE DECLINE AS THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE MOST ISOLATED ISOLATION IS TERRIBLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS SO SUPER IMPORTANT THAT YOU STAY SOCIAL IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IF YOU JUST MOVED IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE NEGATIVE AND YOU'RE GETTING RID OF THEM AFTER THE LAST TIPS THAT I
TELL YOU TRY LOOKING AT PLACES LIKE THE RED HAT SOCIETY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN I'M SURE THERE ARE MEN'S
TIP IS TO PARTNER WITH YOUR DOCTOR A GOOD DOCTOR IS PREVENTION ORIENTED SO MOST PEOPLE STAY WITH THEIR DOCTORS BECAUSE THAT PERSON IS NICE OR FAMILIAR THAT'S NOT A GOOD REASON TO STAY WITH A DOCTOR YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS PREVENTION UNDERSTANDS NUTRITION UNDERSTANDS EXERCISE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF STRETCHING UNDERSTANDS THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THINGS THE REASON WHY IS I
LIKE IT YOU KEEP IT AND WE DONATE ALL OF THE PROFITS 100 OF THE PROFITS FROM THE TEDXVIP CODE
TO
VARIOUS CHARITIES I MEAN OUR BASIC GOAL IS TO IMPROVE LIVES AROUND THE WORLD IN THE US WHAT THAT MEANS IS
SPONSORING ALZHEIMER'S PREVENTION RESEARCH AND
IN MOTION I LIKE WALKING THROUGH NATURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO IT'S REALLY GOOD BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS STRESS ACTUALLY SHRINKS YOUR BRAIN
AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT STRESS REWIRES YOUR BRAIN IT AFFECTS MEMORY IT AFFECTS DECISION MAKING
IT ACTUALLY ENDS UP MESSING WITH YOUR EMOTIONAL REGULATORY SYSTEM SO IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU I WAS WORKING AT THIS DAY JOB FUNDING ANTI AGINGGAMES AND IT WAS REALLY STRESSFUL AS I WAS READING THE STUDY ABOUT HOW STRESS SHRINKS YOUR BRAIN
AND
IT SAID THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE HIGH STRESS JOB LOW CONTROL MULTIPLE BOSSES TELLING YOU OPPOSITE THINGS HAD THE WORST THIS IS STRESS AND BRAIN SHRINKS IT AND I WAS LIKE OH MY GOD THAT'S MY JOB SO
I DECIDED TO QUIT I ENDED UP LEAVING SHORTLY THEREAFTER BUT IF YOU'RE IN THAT
IS A FANTASTIC PLACE TO MEET REALLY HIGH QUALITY NEW FRIENDS VOLUNTEERMATCH ORG IS GREAT IDEALIST ORG IF YOU'RE IN L A LAWORKS COM HAS A LOT OF PROJECTS PHENOMENAL PLACE
NEXT IS HAVING A PURPOSE AND LIFE DIRECTION IS
FANTASTIC FOR YOU RESEARCHERS AT RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER FOUND THAT THE PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST PURPOSE AND LIFE DIRECTION
HAD 2
AND INTERACTIVE YOU GENERALLY WANT TO GET MOST OF YOUR VITAMINS FROM FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND NOT YOUR SUPPLEMENTS BUT YOUR DOCTOR MIGHT ASK YOU TO USE SOME SUPPLEMENTS TOO AND A GOOD DOCTOR KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT SO FOR INSTANCE NOT HAVING ENOUGH
VITAMIN B12 IS LINKED TO MEMORY LOSS BUT YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ABSORBING OR NOT THE GOOD DOCTOR KNOWS HOW TO MEASURE THIS
THAT IS FANTASTIC FOR YOU YOU DOCTOR WILL TELL YOU THAT IF YOU HAVE AN EXERCISE AT ALL
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS FOR YOU TO JUST START GETTING INTO CONSISTENT EXERCISES SO YOU MAY START WITH 10 MINUTES A DAY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M INCREDIBLY LAZY WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISING
JUST INCREDIBLY LAZY EXERCISING FOR THE SAKE OF VANITY NEVER MOTIVATED ME BECAUSE I JUST FIGURE PLUS OR MINUS TEN TWENTY POUNDS WHO CARES
IT'S TRUE IT'S JUST NOT MOTIVATING BUT WHEN I READ THIS STUDY AVOIDING ALZHEIMER'S AND MAINTAINING YOUR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE LATER ON A LIFE HUGELY MOTIVATING SO I STARTED WALKING AND I GOT TELL YOU IT INCREASES YOUR ENERGY
YOU DROP WEIGHT AND YOU JUST FEEL SO MUCH HEALTHIER
IF YOU ACTUALLY INCLUDE VIGOROUS AEROBIC EXERCISES THAT GET YOUR HEART RATE UP THREE TIMES A WEEK AT LEAST 20 MINUTES THAT ACTUALLY REDUCES YOUR RISK DOWN TO 50 SO
AND JUST REMEMBER THAT SEEING THE OPPORTUNITY IN ALL CHALLENGES IS A REALLY GOOD THING LEARNING THE LESSONS IN MISTAKES AND THEN LETTING GO IS A REALLY GOOD THING
A BIG FAN OF TED AND TEDX I THINK THESE EVENTS ARE WONDERFUL SO I'M THE CEO AND ONE OF THE CO FOUNDERS OF ANTI AGINGGAMES COM
ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THE TWO GENERATION ABOVE ME WERE THE ONES WHO KICK DOWN THE DOORS OF SEXISM AND RACISM AND THEY'RE NOW KICKING DOWN THE DOORS OF HOMOPHOBIA
AND THERE'S A LOT OF MORE WORK TO BE DONE SO PICK ANY CAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND GO OUT THERE AND DO IT YOUR BRAIN WILL THANK YOU AND SOCIETY WILL
THANK YOU NEXT ONE IS TO RELAX RELAXATION IS FANTASTIC
THIS AND JUST STRUGGLING WITH IT EMOTIONALLY PHYSICALLY FINANCIALLY I NOTICED THAT THERE IS THIS UNSPOKEN BUT VERY DEEP BELIEF THAT SHE TOO
THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT IT WAS EQUIVALENT TO DRINKING FOUR DRINKS AND GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL SOMEONE'S TEXTING IN THE CAR TELL THEM TO PULL OVER IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT PULL
OVER
AND SECOND TO LAST TIP IS THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET IS FANTASTIC FOR YOU IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY PROVEN DIETS TO JUST REALLY BE GOOD THEY ALSO CALL IT EATING COLORFULLY MEDITERRANEAN DIET INVOLVES SEVEN TO TEN SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY HARD TO GAIN WEIGHT WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SO YOU ACTUALLY END UP FILLING UP WITH THAT AND LOSING WEIGHT
FRESH IS BEST THYME IS SECOND BEST
MEDITERRANEAN DIET PEOPLE ALSO EAT A LOT OF FISH PREFERABLY WILD FISH TWICE A WEEK THEY
LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCERS BY AT LEAST 20
IF YOU HAVE A THYROID
PROBLEM THAT
ACTUALLY MAKES THE THYROID PROBLEM WORSE SO A GOOD DOCTOR KNOWS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF THE STUFF YOURSELF A GOOD DOCTOR WILL TELL YOU HOW YOUR SUPPLEMENTS ARE INTERACTING WITH
OF TAKING PEOPLE FROM
75 OR 85 TO 100 IT'S MORE A MATTER OF TAKING PEOPLE FROM 5 TO 35 USING CLEAN WATER ACCESS MALARIA NETS AND THINGS LIKE
THAT EDUCATION MEDICINE SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING IN GENERAL THE COMPANY DONATES 20 OF ITS PRETAX PROFIT TO CHARITY SO IF YOU LIKE THESE TIPS IF YOU FOUND THEM VALUABLE PLEASE SHARE THEM WE WENT THROUGH YEARS OF RESEARCH TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THIS TO YOU TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
DON'T WORRY THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS WHAT PART OF YOUR HEAD GET HIT HOW LONG YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS FOR THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT GOING FORWARD THAT YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR HEAD
WEAR A HELMET WHEN YOU'RE BIKE READING THE
PLACE THAT YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET HIT IN THE HEAD IS IN YOUR CAR SO ALWAYS WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT ALWAYS PICK A SAFER CARD MAKE THAT ONE OF YOUR PRIMARY SCREENINGS AND NEVER TEXT WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING
STUDIES SHOW THAT ANY KIND OF LEARNING ANY KIND OF MIND ENGAGING GAME PLAY IS FANTASTIC FOR YOU THE KEYS ARE THAT HAS TO BE INTERACTIVE
MIND ENGAGING IT'S EXTRA GOOD IF IT'S FUN
SO PASSIVE ENTERTAINMENT IS LIKE WATCHING TV OR DAYTIME NAPPING
INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDES PLAYING BRAIN FITNESS GAMES LIKE ON ANTI AGINGGAMES COM BUT YOU ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN NEED OUR
THINGS FIRST OFF I'M NOT A DOCTOR I MAKE GAMES FOR A LIVING SO THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE THIS IS SIMPLY A STARTING POINT FOR YOU TO SPEAK WITH ABOUT YOUR FUTURE HEALTH WITH YOUR
DOCTOR SECONDLY IT'S ALL GOOD NEWS SO DON'T WORRY I'M NOT GOING TO TERRIFY YOU WITH ANYTHING
THIRD I'M NOT HERE TO SELL YOU ANYTHING WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GIVE YOU A VIP CODE SO YOU CAN HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE GAMES
SO DON'T WORRY NO SUPPLEMENTS NO SNAKE OIL NOTHING LIKE THAT JUST PURE
I ALWAYS CARRY CASH HIDDEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF MY CLOTHING
I VISITED BUT THE PEOPLE I WOULD MEET AND WITH TIME I FELT A GROWING NEED TO SHARE THESE ENCOUNTERS I WANTED TO SEND A POSTCARD IN A SENSE JUST TO SAY
IS ONE MINUTE LONG AND FOCUSES ON ONE ASPECT OR ONE IDEA OF SOMEONE S PERSONAL LIFE BUT MOST OF ALL I MUST ADMIT IT'S JUST A GREAT
AWAKENING IN THAT MOMENT HUMAN POSTCARDS WAS BORN
FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES THEIR PERSPECTIVES AND THEIR UNIQUE LIVES SO I COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND MY OWN AS A CONSEQUENCE THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY TRAVELS WERE NEVER THE LANDSCAPE OR THE ARCHITECTURE
FOR ME TO MEET NEW PEOPLE AND ASK THEM AS MANY QUESTIONS AS I WANT LIKE MAMA SAID
WERE CONDUCTING MORE AND MORE INTERVIEWS WE CAME TO REALISE THAT
LISTENING IS NOT JUST AN ACT OF TAKING LIKE I THOUGHT MY MUM HAD TOLD ME BUT
THAT IT ALSO MEANS GIVING
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO SOMEONE
YOU GIVE THEM SPACE AND TIME TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES TO PUT THEIR IDEAS TOGETHER
YOU OFFER THE OTHER PERSON
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL YOUR INTEREST
YOUR LOVE AND YOUR COMPASSION
LITTLE BOY I KNOW
REMEMBER
THESE PEOPLE
ARE ALL AROUND YOU
IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE
WE ARE ALL ORDINARY PEOPLE WITH EXTRA ORDINARY POINTS OF VIEW IF WE'RE JUST GIVEN A CHANCE TO EXPRESS OURSELVES
OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS MY PARTNER AND I HAVE TRAVELLED THE WORLD
WITH JAKE A TRIPLE AMPUTEE JAKE LOST BOTH OF HIS FEET AND AN ARM IN A SNOWSTORM IN GREENLAND WHERE HE USED TO WORK WE ASKED HIM A FEW
ARE WORLD PEACE EXECUTIVES IT S ON YOUR LAP THAT THE CHILD LEARNS PEACE
THERE IS A PERSON A MAN STANDING STILL HE'S WEARING A BIG BRIGHT GREEN BILLBOARD SUIT INDICATING
ONE OF LONDON S BUSIEST STREETS ALIVE WITH A CONSTANT MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE RUSHING
OR EXPERIENCE THAT CONNECTS US ALL
THE NEXT POSTCARD I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU IS ABOUT AN 8 YEAR OLD BOY CALLED I AKI I'VE ASKED HIM ONE OF MY FAVOURITE QUESTIONS
WHAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE
AND HERE IS HIS ANSWER THIS POSTCARD FROM I AKI TO YOU
I ALSO BELIEVE IN MY MOTHER S ADVICE THAT THE ONLY THING I REALLY OWN AND NO ONE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM ME IS MY KNOWLEDGE
IT CAN BE THE PERSON SITTING NEXT TO YOU
IT CAN BE A CASHIER IN A SHOP IF NO ONE IS IN LINE BEHIND YOU
ASK THEM WHAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING THAT HAPPENED IN THEIR LIFE
WE'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION AROUND THE WORLD AND I CAN ASSURE YOU IT WILL REWARD YOU WITH A HEARTFELT STORY
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS A STORY YOU CAN LEARN FROM
THE PERSON SITTING TO THE LEFT AND TO THE RIGHT OF YOU ARE
STORIES
IF YOU JUST TAKE A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TO LOOK AT THEM FROM THE RIGHT ANGLE
YOU MIGHT BRING OUT THESE EXTRA ORDINARY STORIES OUT OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NOTHING SPECIAL TO SHARE
EMPOWERING YOU
AND THEM AT THE SAME TIME
THANK YOU
I PRACTICE YOGA EVERY MORNING AND EVERY MORNING
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW STIFF MY BODY FEELS
I NEED TO REMIND IT THAT IT CAN BEND AND MOVE AND TWIST
OUR MIND IS THE SAME
IT NEEDS TO BE REMINDED
BIG IDEAS ARE NOT THE ONLY THING WE SHOULD STRIVE FOR
BECAUSE EVERY IDEA HAS POWER IF YOU LISTEN WITH CARE
FOR EXAMPLE
IF I TELL YOU
BREATHING IS IMPORTANT
I AM NOT CONTROLLING YOUR BREATHING
BUT MAYBE
I MAKE YOU MORE AWARE OF YOUR BREATHING NOW OR LATER
THE MESSAGES I CHERISH THE MOST FROM THE PEOPLE I INTERVIEW ARE THE MOST SIMPLE AND RAW IDEAS
WOOL OR COTTON AROUND AND WE SHOULD CHERISH IT WHILE IT IS HERE
CONVERSATION I RUSHED BACK HOME TO EDIT THE VOICE AND THE FOOTAGE TOGETHER AND THE RESULT GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS TO SEE HIM STANDING IN THAT CROWD ALMOST
YOU ARE EATING THE SAME CHICKEN AS DAY 1 I KNOW
SOME PHONE CALLS HEY WHAT ARE YOU UP TO DID I MENTION I M AVAILABLE I NEEDED TO GET PAID TO DO
AS THE YARDSTICK TO JUDGE EVERYTHING BY INSTEAD OF SEEING PASSION FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS THE FIRE THAT IGNITES WHEN YOU START RUBBING STICKS TOGETHER ANYWAY I WAS SUCH A MESS
AROUND HELPING PEOPLE FIND THEIR PASSIONS RIGHT BOOKS COACHING WEBINARS WHATEVER AND THEIR HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT S GREAT I M ALL ABOUT SELF DISCOVERY
OKAY
BUT WHEN YOU ASK SOMEONE OR YOU RE ASKED LIKE WHAT S YOUR PASSION IT S TRIGGERING IT S LIKE OH MY GOD I HAVE TO CAME OUT WITH A GOOD ANSWER FOR THIS
ONE OF MY FRIENDS IN HER MID FORTIES AND SHE S LOOKING WHAT S HER LIFE GOING TO BE NOW AND SHE S LIKE
I DON T KNOW WHAT I M PASSIONATE ABOUT AND SHE S LEGITIMATELY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SHE S READY TO HIRE A TEAM OF PEOPLE IT S LIKE WHY ARE WE WORRYING ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE SHE THINKS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER
I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ME WHEN I WAS IN THE SEVENTH GRADE AND EVERYONE WAS REALLY INTO LIKE THE ROCK BANDS AND THEIR ACTORS AND THEY WOULD CARVE THE NAMES OF THOSE BANDS IN A TABLES IN A LIBRARY
AND I
NEVER CARVED ANYTHING BECAUSE I COULDN T THINK OF ANYTHING TO CARVE
BECAUSE IT PLANTED AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SEED I DIDN T KNOW WAS THERE AND THAT BEARS FRUIT TO THIS DAY NOW AS YOU
I MEAN IT WAS LIKE JUST INTIMIDATING RIGHT AND
THIS COMPELLING I MEAN THIS REALLY YOU KNOW FORCEFUL CULTURAL IMPERATIVE TO CHOOSE YOUR PASSION
IT S STRESSFUL TO ME BUT IT S NOT JUST ME IT S EVERYONE I TALK TO AGREES WITH ME
THE WOMAN WHO SOLD ME THIS DRESS I TOLD HER WHAT I NEEDED THE DRESS FOR WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND SHE SAID OH MY GOSH I REALLY NEED TO HEAR THIS TALK BECAUSE I JUST GRADUATE FROM SCHOOL MY FRIENDS AND I WE DON T KNOW WHAT WE RE PASSIONATE ABOUT WE DON T KNOW WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO DO
I M LEERY OF PASSION FOR A FEW REASONS BUT ONE OF THEM IS THAT PASSION IS NOT A PLAN
IT S A FEELING
REALLY BORING I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ME
BUT THAT S THE FEAR ISN T IT
THAT WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU AT A PARTY ON A DATE AT A JOB INTERVIEW WHAT YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS WOW COMPELLING ANSWER AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU RE NOT
GENEROUS PEOPLE WILL THANK YOU AND HUG YOU AND PAY YOU FOR IT AND THAT S WHERE
YOU WANT TO CHANGE CAREERS GREAT BUT IF YOU RE SITTING AROUND WAITING FOR PASSION TO SHOW UP AND TAKE IT YOU RE GOING TO BE WAITING A LONG TIME
SO DON T WAIT
INSTEAD SPEND YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION SOLVING YOUR FAVOURITE PROBLEMS
LOOK FOR PROBLEMS THAT NEED SOLVING
BE
OR THAT YOU DON T HAVE A SINGULAR OBSESSION OR SCARY TALENT THAT YOU HIDING AND THAT YOUR LIFE ISN T WORTH LIVING AND IT S NOT TRUE
PASSION IS NOT A JOB
A SPORT OR A HOBBY
IT IS THE FULL FORCE OF YOUR ATTENTION AND ENERGY THAT YOU GIVE TO WHATEVER IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND IF YOU RE SO BUSY LOOKING FOR THIS PASSION
YOU COULD MISS OPPORTUNITIES THAT CHANGE YOUR LIFE
REALIZE PASSION LIVES AND REALIZING WHAT YOU HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE WHY DO YOU THINK WHEN WE RE ASKING PEOPLE WHAT THEY RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THEY SAY HELPING OTHER PEOPLE
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE COLUMNS IS A PIECE BY DILBERT CREATOR SCOTT ADAMS HE WROTE A PIECE IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A FEW YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW WE FAILED HIS WAY TO SUCCESS AND ONE OF HIS JOBS WAS A COMMERCIAL LOAN OFFICER
AND HE WAS TAUGHT SPECIFICALLY DO NOT LOAN MONEY TO SOMEONE FOLLOWING THEIR PASSION
MY MOTHER BEGGED ME SHE SAID PLEASE TAKE A JOB ANY JOB YOU RE NOT GOING TO BE STUCK YOU RE STUCK NOW
YOU DON T CREATE YOUR LIFE FIRST AND THEN LIVE IT YOU CREATE IT BY LIVING IT NOT AGONIZING ABOUT IT
SHE S RIGHT SHE S ALWAYS RIGHT
AND SO I TOOK A FULL TIME JOB AS AN ASSISTANT AT A MANAGEMENT CONSULTING FIRM WHERE I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT NOTHING OKAY
ZERO
EXCEPT I KNEW I HAD A REASON TO GET UP IN THE MORNING GET SHOWERED LEAVE THE HOUSE PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR ME WHEN I GOT THERE AND I GOT A PAYCHECK EVERY TWO WEEKS AND THAT IS AS GOOD A REASON TO TAKE A JOB AS ANY
I LOVED THE JOB I REALLY DID BUT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS OVER AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO END IT
AND THEN IT BROKE UP WITH ME DON T YOU LOVE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS
AT THE TIME I VE BEEN ALSO HOSTING A RADIO SHOW FOR THE MARTHA STEWART BRAND ON SIRIUS XM AND
THEN NOT LONG AFTER THAT GOT CANCELLED TOO
ON THE DAY OF MY LAST SHOW I GOT ONTO THE ELEVATOR AT THE 36TH FLOOR AND AS IT STARTED TO DROP
I STARTED TO CRY
EVERY FLOOR TOOK ME FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM WHAT I HAD BEEN
A MAGAZINE EDITOR A RADIO HOST THE PERSON WITH THE COOL JOB TO TALK ABOUT AT PARTIES
YOU
AND SOMETIMES YOU DON T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT RIGHT I MEAN I DON T I LOVE NOT KNOWING WHAT I M GOING TO BE DOING FIVE YEARS FROM NOW OR WILL BE INTO AND THAT S OKAY IT S OKAY NOT TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE THE MOST FULFILLING RELATIONSHIPS THE MOST FULFILLING CAREERS ARE THOSE THAT STILL HAVE THE POWER TO SURPRISE YOU
AND AS FOR THE THINGS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO DO YOU WANT TO WRITE A BOOK YOU WANT TO START A
S THAT YOU HAVE ONE SINGULAR PASSION AND YOUR JOB IS TO FIND IT
AND TO PURSUE IT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL ELSE
AND IF YOU DO THAT EVERYTHING WILL FALL INTO PLACE
AND IF YOU DON T YOU FAILED
THE PRESSURE STARTS REALLY YOUNG
AND IT GOES YOUR WHOLE LIFE BUT IT S PERHAPS MOST PRONOUNCED WHEN YOU RE GRADUATING FROM SCHOOL RIGHT AFTER THIS
IS WHERE YOUR ENERGY AND EFFORT MEETS SOMEONE ELSE S NEED THAT S
AND VALUE YOU DON T FOLLOW YOU PASSION YOUR PASSION FOLLOWS YOU THANK YOU {NS}
WHEN I GOT MY FIRST JOB AS A MAGAZINE EDITOR IN PUBLISHING I WAS THRILLED BUT HAD TO TAKE PRETTY BIG PAY CUT
BECAUSE AT THE TIME I D BEEN A CATALOGUE COPYWRITER AT A WIG COMPANY
LAUGH IF YOU WILL CLEARLY YOU ARE AND MANY MANY PEOPLE DID BUT WIGS PAID
SO I HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SOME MONEY A FRIEND OF MINE INVITED ME TO A JEWELRY PARTY I SAID WHAT IS A JEWELRY PARTY SHE SAID IT S LIKE TUPPERWARE BUT WITH BRACELETS I SAID OKAY GOT IT
GOT IT I WENT AND I HAD THE BEST TIME
I WAS THERE HANGING OUT TRYING ON JEWELRY THE SALESPERSONS HAVING A GREAT TIME AND I WAS LIKE
THAT S A JOB I
COULD I COULD DO THAT
I MEAN REALLY SHE SEEMS TO BE HAVING A GREAT TIME NOW I HAD NO BACKGROUND IN SALES UNLESS YOU COUNT GIRL SCOUTS AND I WAS TERRIBLE
AND I HAD NO PASSION FOR JEWELRY I MEAN HONESTLY MY EARRINGS COST 20 COMBINED ALL OF THEM
AND YET I WAS LIKE I THINK I CAN SLING SILVER JEWELRY TO SUBURBAN MOMS DRINKING DAIQUIRIS YES I COULD DO THAT AND SO I DID IT I SIGNED UP I BECAME SILPADA DESIGNS REP AND I LISTEN TO ME I WAS NOT SETTING A WORLD ON FIRE RIGHT AWAY REALLY I WAS SO AWKWARD AND AFRAID OF SELLING AND THEN I GOT BETTER
I MEAN I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY IF YOU RE NOT PAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE VERY LONG BUT THIS IDEA THAT I HAD TO KNOW WHAT I SUPPOSE TO DO NOW RIGHT I M SUPPOSED TO PURSUE THIS PASSION IT S JUST BUGGED ME IT ALWAYS HAD
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'M A DEMOGRAPHER DEMOGRAPHERS STUDY POPULATIONS MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE UNITED
JUST THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY SICK AND MY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IF ALL ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AT LEAST A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE WE COULD SAVE
WE HEAR STORIES ABOUT SCHOOLS THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS OR THAT HAVE TOO MANY TEACHERS WHO JUST DON'T CARE ENOUGH
WHEN YOU WALK BY A FAILING SCHOOL YOU MIGHT THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A PRISON WITH THE CAGES ON THE WINDOWS AND THE GUARDS AT THE DOOR
IN THAT SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME YOUR DOCTOR CAN CHECK YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE OR YOUR CHOLESTEROL AND
WE LAG BEHIND THOSE COUNTRIES WHEN IT COMES TO SURVIVAL
IN OTHER WORDS WE PAY FOR BETTER HEALTH CARE THAN SWITZERLAND
YET WE HAVE SHORTER LIVES THAN SLOVENIA
THE AVERAGE PERSON SEES A DOCTOR FOR JUST ABOUT TWO HOURS PER YEAR
THAT COMES OUT TO ABOUT SEVEN DAYS TOTAL OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFETIME
THESE DRUGS PROMISE US HAPPIER HEALTHIER LIVES BUT THEY COME WITH A LIST OF SIDE EFFECTS A MILE LONG
THE SICK AND THE HEALTHY OR AS I LIKE TO SAY THE SICK AND THE NOT YET SICK BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY
DRUG TO TREAT YOUR MOST VEXING MEDICAL PROBLEM BUT YOUR DOCTOR ALREADY HAS TOO LITTLE TIME TO HELP YOU QUIT
EDUCATION IS SELF CONTROL
EDUCATION TEACHES US THE REWARDS OF PERSISTENCE WITH DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING TASKS
INCLUDING LEARNING ALGEBRA AND READING SHAKESPEARE
OR QUITTING SMOKING AND STARTING A NEW DIET OR EXERCISE REGIMEN
THIRD
EDUCATION IS KNOWLEDGE
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO AVOID HEALTH RISKS WHERE POSSIBLE
AND HOW TO MANAGE THOSE RISKS IF WE CAN'T AVOID THEM
ABOUT HOW WE LET TOO MANY CHILDREN SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS WHERE THEY'LL END UP WITH LOW PAYING JOBS AND EVEN WORSE SHORTER LIVES
EDUCATION IS A FLEXIBLE RESOURCE LET ME TELL YOU FOUR WAYS THAT EDUCATION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS TO INVEST IN THEIR OWN HEALTH
DIET AND THE TIME TO COOK OR FOR THE TIME AND MOTIVATION TO EXERCISE
EVERY DAY WE HEAR STORIES ABOUT SOME NEW MIRACLE CURE THAT WORKS FOR THREE MICE IN SOME LABORATORY AND THAT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU SOMEDAY {LG} BUT YOU BETTER HAVE THE RIGHT HEALTH
THAT'S THE NUMBER OF LIVES WE COULD SAVE IF WE ELIMINATED ALL ACCIDENTAL DEATHS INCLUDING DEATHS FROM CAR CRASHES FALLS OVERDOSES AND POISONINGS
JEREMY YOU'RE OFFERING ME A LOT OF POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY WITH THIS BUDGET
AND USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT I WANT TO GO ON VACATION
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YEAH I THINK THAT SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR POPULATION AS A WHOLE
IS TO MAKE SURE OUR SCHOOLS WORK FROM KINDERGARTEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE AND TO ELIMINATE POVERTY WE HAVE TOO MANY FOLKS THAT ARE
LEFT BEHIND ECONOMICALLY AND WHAT'S WORSE
THEY'RE THE FOLKS THAT LOSE OUT WHEN IT COMES TO LONGER HEALTHIER LIVES JD
GREAT THANK YOU PATRICK PK THANK
LIVES EVERY SINGLE YEAR TO PUT THAT NUMBER IN PERSPECTIVE THAT'S THE NUMBER OF LIVES WE COULD SAVE IF ALL CURRENT SMOKERS IN THE UNITED STATES QUIT SMOKING RIGHT NOW
YOU MIGHT EVEN WORRY ABOUT THE LOST CREATIVITY WHEN ART AND MUSIC AND RECESS ARE CANCELLED
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SEE
WHEN I WALK BY A FAILING SCHOOL I SEE A BODY COUNT
I SEE 145000 PREMATURE DEATHS EVERY SINGLE YEAR
IN FACT WE COULD SAVE 145000 LIVES EVERY SINGLE YEAR IF ALL ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAD AT LEAST A HIGH
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE HERE TODAY WITH A STORY THAT GIVES YOU 145000 REASONS
YOUR DOCTOR CANNOT WRITE YOU A PRESCRIPTION FOR A LESS STRESSFUL JOB WITH MORE PAY OR FOR CLEANER AIR OR FOR STRONGER SOCIAL
BONES OR BAD KNEES THEN YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR DEMOGRAPHERS FOCUS ON THE HEALTH OF EVERYONE IN
SEE ADVERTISEMENTS FOR DRUGS THAT SHOW ATTRACTIVE MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE WALKING ON THE BEACH OR KAYAKING
VALUE HEALTH AND WHO CAN SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS TO BE HEALTHY SIMPLY PUT EDUCATION MAKES HEALTH EASIER
A STORY ABOUT HOW COMPLETING HIGH SCHOOL COULD SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS QUITTING SMOKING
AND YOU BETTER HAVE A DOCTOR WHO'S WILLING TO INJECT YOU WITH SOME UNPROVEN NEW TREATMENT YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T HURT TO CROSS YOUR
THAT'S THE NUMBER OF LIVES WE COULD SAVE IF WE ELIMINATED ALL SUICIDES AND ALL HOMICIDES TWO AND HALF TIMES OVER
EVERY SINGLE YEAR
MOST OF US THINK THAT DOCTORS ARE THE FIRST LINE WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING HEALTH
BUT DOCTORS CAN'T CURE WHAT AILS US
ME EACH ONE OF YOU IS ONE IN MILLION WELL ACTUALLY YOU'RE ONE IN ABOUT 320 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U S RIGHT NOW
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT WHEN WE WERE KIDS WE ALL HAD PB AMP JS AND CARTONS OF MILK THOSE WEREN'T LOADED WEAPONS ON A LUNCHROOM TABLE AND IT BEGGED THE QUESTION WHAT HAS CHANGED AND AS I WAS
KIDS NOW HAS AUTISM ALLERGIES ADHD ASTHMA CANCER DOESN'T CARE WHERE WE WORK THE PRESIDENT'S CANCER PANEL SAYS 41 OF US ARE EXPECTED TO GET CANCER AND AS I THOUGH ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT WAS HAVING ON OUR
STRONG THAT IT MERITED INVESTIGATION
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
EXERCISED THAT LEVEL OF PRECAUTION BECAUSE THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ALLERGENICITY OF THESE FOODS AND SO I THOUGHT
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THESE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY EITHER DIDN'T ALLOW THESE INGREDIENTS
OR THEY LABELED THEM
AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I LEARNED ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED HOW I VIEWED THINGS
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OUR AMERICAN COMPANIES HAD INTRODUCED ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS ARTIFICIAL DYES ARTIFICIAL GROWTH HORMONES GENETICALLY ENGINEERED INGREDIENTS THEY HAD
PUT ALL THIS STUFF INTO OUR FOOD AND I GOT IT AS AN ANALYST IT DRIVES PROFITABILITY
AT THE SAME TIME
OUR OWN AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WERE FORMULATING THEIR PRODUCTS
ALL OF US CAN DO SOMETHING
AND AS WE INVEST IN US
IN OUR FAMILIES
IN OUR ECONOMY
WE WILL CREATE A BETTER FOOD SYSTEM
ONE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE 21ST CENTURY AND I TRULY BELIEVE
SO THAT MEANT WE WERE OUTSOURCING ANY OF THE ORGANIC FOOD THAT WE DID WANT TO OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA
AND I THOUGHT WE NEED TO BRING THIS HOME SUPPORT OUR OWN ECONOMY SUPPORT OUR OWN FARMERS AND BUILD THIS BETTER FOOD SYSTEM SO THAT CLEAN AND SAFE FOOD CAN BE AFFORDABLE TO ALL AMERICANS
THANKFULLY
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I RACED HER TO THE PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE
AND SHE STARTS RATTLING OFF THESE STATISTICS ABOUT FOOD ALLERGIES HOW FROM 1997 TO 2002 THERE'D BEEN A DOUBLING OF THE PEANUT ALLERGY
AND SHE STARTED ASKING ME WHAT I'D FED THE KIDS FOR BREAKFAST AND THAT MORNING IT HAD BEEN TUBES OF BLUE YOGURT L'EGGO MY EGGO WAFFLES AND SCRAMBLED EGGS
AND AS I WAS LISTENING TO HER TALK ABOUT FOOD ALLERGIES ALL I COULD THINK WAS SINCE WHEN
SINCE WHEN HAD SO MANY LITTLE KIDS BECOME SO ALLERGIC
AND THAT DAY A QUESTION ENTERED MY MIND THAT STILL HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED
AND AS I LOOKED AT THE BUSINESS MODEL SURE ENOUGH IT DROVE THE SALE OF THE CHEMICALS BEING
BECAUSE THE PLANT PRODUCED THAT INSECTICIDE INTERNALLY
THOSE FOODS WERE NOW REGULATED BY THE EPA AS A PESTICIDE
AND I THOUGHT WHY WEREN'T WE TOLD THIS THIS
IS FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IT'S PATENTED BY THE US PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE IT'S REGULATED BY THE EPA AS A PESTICIDE
HOW CAN THEY TELL US THIS IS THE SAME
SHE IMMEDIATELY SAID WOULD YOU LIKE SAUVIGNON BLANC OR CHARDONNAY AND I REMEMBER THINKING COME ON LADY STOP WITH THE FANCY FRENCH WORDS AND JUST GIVE ME SOME WHITE WINE
I HAD A VERY FRONT ROW SEAT TO THAT STRUGGLE MY FAMILY HAS BEEN PART OF THAT STRUGGLE FOR VERY LONG TIME I COME FROM FAMILY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ELITE UNIVERSITIES AS RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY TELLS US ARE CHEAPER FOR LOW INCOME KIDS BECAUSE THESE UNIVERSITIES HAVE BIGGER ENDOWMENTS CAN OFFER MORE GENEROUS FINANCIAL AID
I REMEMBER I LEARNED THIS WHEN I GOT THE FINANCIAL AID LETTER FROM YALE FOR MYSELF
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN NEED BASED AID WHICH IS A TERM I HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE
BUT IF YOU THINK OF WHERE I'M FROM IN THE SOUTH IN APPALACHIA
IN SOUTHERN OHIO
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT KIDS LIKE THAT WILL RISE THE AMERICAN DREAM IN THOSE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IS IN A VERY REAL SENSE JUST A DREAM
SO WHY IS THAT HAPPENING
VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTRIBUTED SO TAKE UTAH FOR INSTANCE IN UTAH A POOR KID IS ACTUALLY DOING OK VERY LIKELY TO LIVE THEIR SHARE AND THEIR PART IN THE AMERICAN DREAM
WANT TO DO BETTER FOR YOURSELF AND FOR YOUR FAMILY IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO EVEN KNOW WHAT THOSE CHOICES ARE WHEN YOU GROW UP IN A COMMUNITY LIKE I DID I DIDN'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAD TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL TO BE A LAWYER
THESE THINGS MY COMMUNITY DIDN'T TEACH ME I REMEMBER WHEN I WENT TO GO BUY A CAR FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME I WAS OFFERED A DEALER'S LOW LOW INTEREST RATE OF 21 9 PERCENT AND I WAS READY TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE
THINK ABOUT RISING MORTALITY RATES IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND RECOGNIZE THAT FOR A LOT OF THESE FOLKS THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE SEEING ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING RISING DEATH RATES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES SO THERE'S A VERY REAL SENSE OF STRUGGLE
THE PROBLEM OF BRAIN DRAIN WHERE THE REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND HIGH SKILLED WORK AT HOME END UP MOVING ELSEWHERE SO THEY DON'T BUILD A BUSINESS OR NON PROFIT WHERE THEY'RE FROM THEY END UP GOING ELSEWHERE AND TAKING THEIR TALENTS WITH THEM
IF YOU GROW UP IN AN AREA LIKE THIS YOU SEE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AS TOOL TO HOLD PEOPLE LIKE YOU BACK THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE WHITE WORKING
HAVE A CHANCE IN THIS 21ST CENTURY KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY ECONOMISTS CALL THE VALUE THAT WE GAIN FROM OUR INFORMAL NETWORKS FROM OUR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES AND FAMILY SOCIAL CAPITAL
THE SOCIAL CAPITAL THAT I HAD WASN'T BUILT FOR 21ST CENTURY AMERICA
AND IT SHOWED
THAT'S A TOUGH FEELING TO GROW UP AROUND THAT'S A TOUGH MINDSET TO
THERE ARE FAILING SCHOOLS IN A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES FAILING TO GIVE KIDS THE EDUCATIONAL LEG UP THAT REALLY MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR KIDS TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES LATER IN LIFE THESE THINGS ARE ALL IMPORTANT I DON'T MEAN TO DISCOUNT THESE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS BUT WHEN LOOK BACK AT MY LIFE AND MY
PERCEIVED REAL BUT IT'S THERE AND IT WARPS
IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT MY LIFE WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND SAID WELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS KID YOU WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THAT I WOULD HAVE
MOM WAS 12 WHEN SHE SAW MY GRANDMA SET MY GRANDFATHER ON FIRE HIS CRIME WAS THAT HE CAME HOME DRUNK AFTER SHE TOLD HIM IF YOU COME HOME DRUNK I'M GONNA KILL YOU AND
THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY HELPED WAS THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS SO WE THINK OF THE MARINE CORPS AS A MILITARY OUTFIT AND OF COURSE IT IS BUT FOR ME THE US MARINE CORPS WAS A FOUR YEAR CRASH COURSE IN CHARACTER EDUCATION IT TAUGHT ME HOW TO MAKE A BED HOW TO DO LAUNDRY HOW TO WAKE UP EARLY HOW TO MANAGE MY FINANCES
LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT I SAW IN MY OWN FAMILY PROBLEMS CAUSED SOMETIMES BY A LACK OF MONEY PROBLEMS CAUSED SOMETIMES BY A LACK OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND SOCIAL CAPITAL THAT REALLY AFFECTED MY LIFE
OF CHILDREN AREN'T GOING TO HAVE THAT GOOD FORTUNE AND I THINK THAT RAISES REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR ALL OF US ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT
WITHOUT THE MARINE CORPS I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO THAT KNOWLEDGE I WOULD HAVE HAD A FINANCIAL CALAMITY FRANKLY THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT I HAD A LOT OF GOOD FORTUNE IN THE MENTORS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MY LIFE FROM THE
BUT I TURNED TO MY AUNT WHEN I GOT THAT LETTER AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK THIS JUST MEANS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE BEING POOR HAS PAID REALLY WELL
THEY PROVIDED ME A STABLE HOME A STABLE FAMILY THEY MADE SURE THAT WHEN MY PARENTS WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT KIDS NEED THEY STEPPED IN AND FILLED THAT ROLE
REMEMBER THE VERY FIRST TIME I WENT TO A NICE RESTAURANT A REALLY NICE RESTAURANT IT WAS FOR A LAW FIRM RECRUITMENT
I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT I KNOW THAT UNLESS OUR SOCIETY STARTS ASKING BETTER QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHY I WAS SO LUCKY AND ABOUT HOW TO GET THAT LUCK TO MORE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR COUNTRY'S CHILDREN WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM
SOMEONE DO DRUGS OR ABUSE ALCOHOL THESE ARE ALL INSTANCES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA AND THEY'RE PRETTY COMMONPLACE IN MY FAMILY
WHAT HAPPENED WELL ONE THING THAT HAPPENED IS THAT MY GRANDPARENTS THE SAME GRANDPARENTS OF SETTING SOMEONE ON FIRE FAME THEY REALLY SHAPED UP BY THE TIME I CAME AROUND
FOR STARTERS THERE WAS A VERY REAL SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I GREW UP IN THERE WAS A SENSE THAT KIDS HAD THAT THEIR CHOICES DIDN'T
TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO TEACH LOW INCOME PARENTS HOW TO BETTER INTERACT WITH THEIR CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARTNERS WE NEED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE GIVE SOCIAL CAPITAL MENTORSHIP TO LOW INCOME KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE
NOW I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM BUT I DO KNOW THIS IN SOUTHERN OHIO RIGHT NOW THERE'S A KID WHO IS ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THEIR DAD
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME KID ALMOST HALF OF YOU FACE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE KIDS WHO EXPERIENCE THAT LIFE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO DO DRUGS MORE LIKELY TO GO TO
CAME FROM A SOUTHERN OHIO STEEL TOWN AND IT'S A TOWN THAT'S REALLY STRUGGLING IN A LOT OF WAYS WAYS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE BROADER STRUGGLES OF AMERICA'S WORKING CLASS
I GOT ADMITTED TO YALE A FAMILY MEMBER ASKED ME IF I HAD PRETENDED TO BE A LIBERAL TO GET BY THE ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE
SERIOUSLY
AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CASE THAT THERE WAS A LIBERAL BOX TO CHECK ON THE APPLICATION
BUT IT SPEAKS TO A VERY REAL INSECURITY IN THESE
SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT ISN'T JUST ABOUT GOOD OR BAD POLICY YOU SEE IT AS SOMETHING THAT'S ACTIVELY CONSPIRING WHERE PEOPLE WITH POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL POWER ARE WORKING AGAINST YOU
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT YOU SEE THAT
CONSPIRACY AGAINST YOU
BUT SHE WAS ALSO THIS INCREDIBLY PERCEPTIVE WOMAN DESPITE NOT EVEN HAVING MIDDLE SCHOOL EDUCATION SHE RECOGNIZED THE MESSAGE THAT MY COMMUNITY HAD FOR ME THAT MY CHOICES DIDN'T MATTER THAT THE DECK WAS STACKED AGAINST ME SHE ONCE TOLD ME JD NEVER BE LIKE THOSE LOSERS WHO THINK THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST THEM YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
LOW INCOME KIDS FACE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA COMPARED TO ONLY 29 PERCENT FOR UPPER INCOME
WONDERING WHETHER WHEN HE COMES THROUGH THE DOOR HE'LL WALK CALMLY OR STUMBLE DRUNKLY
THERE'S KID
WHOSE MOM STICKS A NEEDLE IN HER ARM AND PASSES OUT AND
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY SHE DOESN'T COOK HIM DINNER AND HE GOES TO BED HUNGRY THAT NIGHT
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S GOING ON THAT OUR COMMUNITY DOESN'T LIKE TO {NS} WORKING CLASS KIDS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FACE WHAT'S CALLED ADVERSE CHILDHOOD
I'M NOT GOING TO GO AFTER THE TRADITIONAL MARKERS OF SUCCESS LIKE A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION OR A PRESTIGIOUS JOB BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THOSE THINGS ARE UNLIKE ME THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO LET ME IN
MEASURES WHETHER KIDS LIKE ME WHO GROW UP IN POOR COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE A MATERIALLY BETTER EXISTENCE OR WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO STAY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY CAME
BUT I USED MY POWERS OF DEDUCTION AND RECOGNIZED THAT CHARDONNAY AND SAUVIGNON BLANC WERE TWO SEPARATE TYPES OF WHITE WINE AND SO I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD TAKE THE CHARDONNAY BECAUSE FRANKLY THAT WAS THE EASIEST ONE TO PRONOUNCE FOR ME SO I
YOU COMBINE ALL THAT
THE HOPELESSNESS
THE DESPAIR
THE CYNICISM ABOUT THE FUTURE
THE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
THE LOW SOCIAL CAPITAL
AND YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHY ME
AT THE AGE OF 14 WAS READY TO BECOME JUST ANOTHER STATISTIC ANOTHER KID WHO FAILED TO BEAT THE ODDS
WHAT YOU WANT AND WHAT YOU EXPECT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
AN EXPECTATION IS A BELIEF ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO GET WHAT YOU WANT
AS A PSYCHOLOGIST THAT STUDIES HOW PEOPLE CREATE THEIR FUTURES ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE LEARNED
THAT HAVING AN EXPECTATION THAT DIFFERS FROM WHAT YOU WANT
ISN'T JUST THE REASON YOU DON'T BUY LOTTERY TICKETS
IT
OF THEM DIDN T SHOW UP AT ALL ONE DAY AMY COMES INTO MY OFFICE AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BURSTS INTO TEARS
IS OFTENTIMES THE VERY THING THAT YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING REMEMBER YOU WANT TO WIN THE LOTTERY BUT YOU DON'T EXPECT TO
AND SO YOU'RE HOLDING BACK WHEN YOU DON T ACT ON WHAT YOU WANT YOU TAKE YOURSELF OUT OF THE GAME
I'D SEEN PEOPLE GIVE UP ON THEIR MARRIAGES
THEIR HEALTH
THEIR CAREERS
GIVE UP ON THEIR ENTIRE LIVES BECAUSE THEY DIDN T THINK THEY COULD GET WHAT THEY WANTED
AND SO THEY WEREN'T WILLING TO TRY
THERE IS PROBABLY
YOU'RE EXPECTING SOMETHING POSITIVE TO HAPPEN THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT AND YOU CAN
STOP RIGHT THERE
NO NEED TO FIX POSITIVE EMOTIONS
IF YOU'RE EXPECTING SOMETHING YOU DON T WANT
THEN YOU GOING TO BE FEELING A NEGATIVE EMOTION LIKE ANXIETY
FEAR
DREAD
OVERWHELMED
THOSE ARE ALL SIGNS THAT YOU HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THAT SITUATION
WAS A GORGEOUS AND SUCCESSFUL WOMAN BUT SHE WAS ALSO SORT OF SHY
VERY SELF DEPRECATING AND SHE HAD A HISTORY OF PICKING THE WRONG MEN
AMY HAD RECENTLY GOTTEN OUT OF A BAD MARRIAGE SHE WORKED ON HERSELF SO SHE WAS READY TO MEET SOMEONE NEW
SHE DECIDED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE ONLINE DATING TRY
BUT SHE WAS HAVING
ONE BAD DATE
AFTER THE NEXT
THE MEN DIDN T LOOK LIKE THEIR PICTURES
NOT BUYING IT
GUARANTEES LOSING
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY DO WE DO THIS
OUR BRAINS WORK ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ANTICIPATION WE CONSTANTLY PREDICT WHAT WE THINK IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN BEFORE IT EVER OCCURS
IF YOU RE WALKING IN THE PARK AND YOU HEAR A DOG BARKING BEHIND YOU
AND THEN TURN AROUND TO SEE BIG
IT WAS THAT SHE DIDN T BELIEVE HER FUTURE COULD BE BETTER THAN THE PAST WITHOUT THAT BELIEF SHE WASN'T ABLE TO CREATE SOMETHING BETTER EVEN THOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY HAD PRESENTED ITSELF RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
YOU BEGIN TO SEE THE POSSIBILITY
THIS IS WHERE THE SHIFT HAPPENS
EVERY SUCCESSFUL ACTION THAT YOU TAKE TOWARDS THAT PLAN STARTS TO CHANGE YOUR EXPECTATIONS
I REALIZE SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
I DON T EXPECT THIS TO WORK FOR ME
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST SEVERAL YEARS AGO I MAY NOT HAVE EXPECTED A SIMPLE PROCESS LIKE THIS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE S LIVES EITHER
BUT I WAS WORKING WITH A VERY DEPRESSED PATIENT
HOWEVER JUST BECAUSE YOU USE THE PAST TO MAKE PREDICTIONS DOESN T MEAN THAT YOUR PAST IS WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK WHAT
AS SOON AS YOU START TO ANTICIPATE ANY EVENT
YOU BEGIN TO ACT AND FEEL IN WAYS THAT HELP YOU PREPARE
FOR WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF
ANYONE HAS EVER SAID TO YOU
WE NEED TO TALK
THEN YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
I SEE THE MEN NODDING
WHEN YOU DON T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET WHAT YOU WANT YOU FEEL SADNESS DISAPPOINTMENT MAYBE EVEN DEPRESSION
AMY ACTED ON WHAT SHE EXPECTED ANOTHER BAD DATE NOT WHAT SHE WANTED
WAS STARTLED TO REALIZE THAT MANY OF THEM LOOKED AT ME IN THE EXACT SAME WAY
THEY DIDN T DARE TO DREAM ABOUT HOW THEIR LIVES COULD BE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE THEY DIDN T BELIEVE IT WAS POSSIBLE
SO I STARTED TO CHANGE THE FOCUS OF MY WORK TO ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY HELPING MY PATIENTS SHIFT THOSE EXPECTATIONS SO THAT
WELL HOW BAD WAS HE I
ASKED
HE WAS AMAZING SHE SAID
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR
SHE SAID I COMPLETELY BLEW IT
I WAS SO CERTAIN THIS WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BAD DATE AND A WASTE OF MY TIME
I TOLD HIM TO MEET ME FOR COFFEE AFTER MY YOGA CLASS
DIDN T HAVE TIME TO SHOWER
JUST SHOWED UP IN MY GYM CLOTHES HOT AND SWEATY NO MAKE UP
AND THERE HE WAS
MR IMMACULATELY GROOMED
TALL AND HANDSOME
THE PERFECT SMILE
SHE SAID I WAS SO MORTIFIED AND SELF CONSCIOUS I COULDN T EVEN MAKE EYE CONTACT
I JUST SAT THERE
STARING AT THE GROUND LAUGHING NERVOUSLY
UNTIL FINALLY I TOLD HIM I HAD TO PUT MORE MONEY IN MY PARKING METER AND THEN I LEFT
WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOODBYE
RE FOCUSED ON ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG WHY IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT FOR YOU YOU'RE NOT GENERATING THOUGHTS AND IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT GO RIGHT
YOU DON'T NEED A PSYCHOLOGIST TO TELL YOU WHY YOU DIDN'T BUY THOSE TICKETS YOU DIDN'T EXPECT TO WIN GIVEN THE ODDS OF WINNING THE LOTTERY THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A REASONABLE CONCLUSION BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO LEARN HERE
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH ONE OF THE BLANKEST STARES I HAD EVER SEEN
ANXIOUS AND AMBIVALENT BEFORE HER DATE SHE ACTED ON WHAT SHE EXPECTED NOT ON WHAT SHE WANTED AND SO SHE GOT
WHAT SHE EXPECTED
ANOTHER BAD DATE
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS CAN KEEP US SO STUCK IS WE HAVE AN AUTOMATIC TENDENCY TO USE THE PAST TO PREDICT THE FUTURE
YOUR PAST ISN T WHAT DEFINES WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU ARE GOING IT S YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE THAT LIMIT YOU MOST NOW HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO TAKE ACTION BASED ON WHAT YOU WANT
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT
YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP OUT OF THE PAST
AND CREATE THE LIFE THAT YOU TRULY WANT TO LIVE THANK
YOU
IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE GO ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIFE THINKING THAT THEY ARE ACTING ON WHAT THEY WANT WHEN IN REALITY THEY ARE ACTING ON THEIR EXPECTATIONS
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THREE SIMPLE STEPS THAT WILL HELP YOU BEGIN TO SHIFT YOUR EXPECTATIONS
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO RIGHT NOW THOUGH IS IMAGINE
AN UPCOMING FUTURE EVENT
IT CAN BE A GOAL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE
A WORK PRESENTATION AN UPCOMING HOLIDAY EVENT WITH YOUR FAMILY
GOT IT
OVERRIDE THE AUTOMATIC THINKING AND PLAN
FOR HOW TO CREATE A DIFFERENT OUTCOME
IF AMY HAD PLANNED FOR HER DATE TO GO WELL
THINGS MIGHT HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY
OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO GET WHAT WE WANT HAVE A VERY PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR EMOTIONAL WELL BEING
A LARGE PART OF OUR BRAIN
WITHIN A YEAR HAD QUIT HIS DEAD END JOB AND STARTED HIS OWN SUCCESSFUL COMPANY WHEN YOU'RE MOTIVATED BY WHAT YOU WANT CHANGE IS POSSIBLE
HAD BEEN TREATING HIM FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS WE HAD DONE SO MUCH WORK TOGETHER BUT NOTHING WE DID SEEMED TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
CAN GIVE UP WANTING WHAT YOU WANT TELL YOURSELF IT WASN T REALLY WORTH THE EFFORT YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT IT ANYWAY OR YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR EXPECTATIONS TO MATCH UP WITH WHAT YOU WANT SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE CONSISTENT ACTION
HAVING BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR MORE THAN 12 YEARS ONE OF THE THINGS I HEAR MOST OFTEN IS I WANT TO CHANGE MY LIFE
LOSING THAT LAST FIVE TO TEN POUNDS GOING FOR THAT DREAM JOB OR RELATIONSHIP IT'S THE REASON WHY NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY TO CREATE CHANGE YOU OFTEN STAY STUCK
PROMINENT IN THE MEDIA THAT I WAS REALLY SURPRISED THAT NOTHING WAS BEING SAID ABOUT THEM IN MY HIGHSCHOOL OUR SCHOOL HESITATED TO BRING UP OR EVEN TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUES
AND FOR WHAT I
MEAN THE REASON IS THAT BECAUSE LOT OF TEACHERS ARE SCARED OF SAYING THE WRONG THING AND
THIS IS BECAUSE EVERYONE IS TOO SCARED ABOUT SOUNDING POLITICALLY CORRECT I MEAN GOD FORBID SOMEONE USE THE TERM BLACK INSTEAD
OF
WAS BROUGHT TO WAYLAND HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS AS A WAY TO MAKE THEM MORE AWARE OF WHAT THEY SAY
TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER AND FEEL COMFORTABLE EXPRESSING IT I WANT PEOPLE TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE AND LEARN HOW TO ADJUST WELL WHEN TOPICS ARE OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE
TO THE END OF MARCH AND SO MANY RACE RELATED ISSUES IN OUR NATION WERE ESCALATING
IGNORANCE OR LACK OF AWARENESS CAUSES THINGS SUCH AS MICRO AGGRESSION AND A MICRO AGGRESSION IS A COMMENT OR ACTION MADE TOWARDS SOMEONE WETHER INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL BASED ON A MARGINALIZED GROUP AND
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEQUENCE THE THREE MILLION BITS OF INFORMATION IN YOUR GENOME
ALL THESE ASSOCIATED SOCIAL MORAL ETHICAL QUESTIONS AND WE SCIENTISTS ARE JUST LOUSY AT EXPLAINING TO THE PUBLIC JUST EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING IN THOSE LABS
CREATING LIKE SOME SORT OF SUPERBUG THAT'S
SIX MONTHS WHEN YOU GOOGLED MY NAME INSTEAD OF GETTING MY SCIENTIFIC PAPERS YOU GOT
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT US CREATING THE NEXT FRANKENSTEIN AND AS A RESULT FOR
WELL WORKING WITH THE SAFE ORGANISMS THAT WE NORMALLY WORK WITH THE CHANCE OF AN ACCIDENT HAPPENING WITH
GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE IT COULD REALLY STIMULATE INNOVATION PUTTING TECHNOLOGY IN THE HANDS OF THE END
WE KNEW THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING THAT WE WERE
TO LOOK AT BOTH THE AMATEUR GROUPS BUT ALSO THE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS
STUFF IS JUST BEGINNING WE'RE ONLY SEEING JUST THE TIP OF THE DNA ICEBERG LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT YOU COULD DO
IT'S POSITIVE BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF
RESOURCES BUT NOW THREE YEARS LATER HERE'S WHERE WE
IT'S A NONPROFIT A COMMUNITY BIOTECH LAB IN BROOKLYN NEW YORK AND THE IDEA WAS PEOPLE COULD COME THEY COULD TAKE CLASSES
IN A BIOHACKER SPACE YOU CAN ANALYZE YOUR GENOME FOR
I THOUGHT SO SO THREE YEARS AGO I GOT TOGETHER WITH SOME FRIENDS OF MINE WHO HAD SIMILAR ASPIRATIONS AND WE
A STUDY AT HARVARD WHERE AT THE END OF THE STUDY THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE MY ENTIRE GENOMIC
DNA CODE IS GETTING EASIER AND CHEAPER BY THE END OF THIS
USE IT TO CHECK IF YOUR CAVIAR IS REALLY BELUGA IF THAT SUSHI IS REALLY TUNA
PROBABLY GOING TO OPEN UP IN MOSCOW ONE IN SOUTH KOREA AND THE COOL THING IS THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL FLAVOR THAT
YOU CAN SEND WEATHER BALLOONS UP INTO THE STRATOSPHERE COLLECT MICROBES SEE WHAT'S UP
GOOD CAREER IN MAINSTREAM SCIENCE THE THING IS
A MOVEMENT THAT IT ADVOCATES MAKING BIOTECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE
A LOT MORE THAN CONVENTIONAL SCIENCE HAS DONE NOW
ACCESS TO PATHOGENS SO THE UNITED NATIONS DID JUST THAT AND THEY
ANALYZE YOUR BREAKFAST CEREAL FOR GMO'S AND YOU CAN
{LG} I DISCOVERED AN INVASIVE SPECIES IN MY OWN
THAT THE PRESS HAD TENDENCY TO CONSISTENTLY OVERESTIMATE OUR CAPABILITIES AND UNDERESTIMATE OUR
AROUND IN THE LAB IN A VERY OPEN FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE NONE OF MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE PREPARED ME FOR WHAT CAME
MEDICINE AND TO TOUCH EVERY ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES
IN THIS ROOM GOT INVOLVED WHO KNOWS WHAT WE COULD DO THIS IS SUCH A NEW AREA AND AS WE
YEARS LATER I RAISED MY OWN LITTLE FAMILY IN A DIFFERENT SETTING
WE LIVED BETWEEN BRICKS IN AN APARTMENT IN AMSTERDAM
BUT LIKE ALL YOUNG PARENTS DO I SHARED THE WORLD OF ANIMALS BY BOOKS NURSERY RHYMES AND MOVIES
CHICKENS PIGS COWS OUR HEROES IN SHORT
PIGS AS INHABITANTS IN HOLLAND SO WHERE ARE THEY
WE REDUCED ANIMALS TO PRODUCTS IN FACTORY SYSTEM WHERE EFFICIENCY
CIRCUS MEAT IS EVERYWHERE BUT WHERE ARE THOSE ANIMALS I HAVEN'T ENCOUNTERED A PIG LATELY
IT SEEMS THAT WE TEND TO FORGET THAT THESE
FIFTY SIX BILLION WE CAN'T
ARE KILLED ON THIS PLANET EACH YEAR TWO
HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC EYE
CLAIM THAT THERE'S A STRONG LINK BETWEEN CLIMATE
CAGED IN A METAL CRATE
AMONGST COUNTLESS OTHER CAGED MOTHERS
SHE'S IN THIS CAGE
DURING INSEMINATION HER WHOLE PREGNANCY
BUT ALSO WHILE GIVING BIRTH TO HER LITTLE ONES
AND THE CRATE IS SO NARROW SHE CAN NOT EVEN TURN AROUND
BUT SHE DOES HER BEST TO NURSE LITTLE BABE
GREEN SHEDS AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAN MEET BABE IN REAL
EQUATOR PLAYING IN THE SUN SURROUNDED BY NATURE AND CHICKENS GOATS AND DUCKS WERE MY COMPANIONS
PRODUCE MEAT FOR THE MILLIONS
MEAT IS CHEAP MEAT IS EVERYWHERE
BUT BEHIND EVERY BITE OF MEAT
IS THE LIFE OF AN ANIMAL
AND IT'S A DIFFERENT LIFE THAN THE ONE PRESENTED TO US AND OUR KIDS
FOR OUR GRANDPARENTS AND FOR MY PARENTS MEAT WAS A TREAT BUT
AND FOOD SECURITY JUST TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THEM THIS INDUSTRY PRODUCES MORE GREENHOUSE GASES THAN
THIS IS THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH BEHIND OUR DAILY CRAVING
PAIN RELIEF AND AFTER THREE WEEKS HE'S TAKEN FROM HIS MOTHER AND PUT IN A
DON'T MEET REALITY ANY PIG WOULD BE BETTER OFF IN OUR 80 SQUARE METER APARTMENT IN AMSTERDAM THAN MANY OTHER DUTCH
THEY LOOKED MUCH LIKE THIS ONE THEY HAVE 3D PRINTED FINGERS A 3D PRINTED PALM AND THEY WORK BY USING BASIC MECHANICS FOR US THIS TASK LOOKED LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE RI
THE PROSTHESIS TO A SIZE THAT WOULD FIT THE BOY WHEN WE GOT THE LIMB RIGHT THE PALM WAS TOO BIG THE FINGERS WERE TOO LONG AND SO ON
MISSING FINGERS IS JUST ONE OF MANY MANY PROBLEMS THAT COULD BE SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF 3D PRINTING
HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT WHAT WE DID WE HELPED ONE PERSON OVER THE PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS AND IT IS FAR TOO LONG TO HELP MANY PEOPLE TO
THEREFORE WE NEEDED SOMETHING MORE EFFICIENT THAN HUMAN LABOR TO DO THIS
BOGGLING TO THINK THAT FINANCIAL ANALYST LIKE ME COULD BE DOING IT
FOR US RI ARDS AND LEVA WERE VERY OPEN MINDED AND THEY WERE READY TO LEARN TOGETHER WITH US SO WE STARTED OUR JOURNEY
EVERY DAY 177 PEOPLE ARE BORN WITH A SIMILAR PROBLEM TO WHAT RI ARDS HAS
PROCESS OF MANUALLY COLLECTING THESE MEASUREMENTS AND REMODELING THE 3D DESIGN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS WHAT TOOK US MOST OF THE TIME DURING THE PERIOD OF TWO
IS MORE IMPORTANT THEY CAN ALSO MAKE 3D SCANS
THIS TO BE POSSIBLE WE NEEDED HIM OVER FOR SEVERAL FITTINGS FOR REPEATED TESTS
IN LATVIA ALONE ROUGHLY 15000 PEOPLE COULD BE HELPED THIS WAY
IF WE ASKED A PROFESSIONAL 3D DESIGNER TO HELP US KNOWING IT TAKES AROUND TWO HOURS TO HELP ONE PERSON THAT DESIGNER COULD HELP ALMOST FOUR PERSONS A DAY
LOOK AT YOUR OWN HAND THEY ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED STRUCTURES IN YOUR BODY
IDEA IN MIND FOR THE LAST ONE AND A HALF YEARS MY TEAM AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE
HAVING SEEN HOW 3D SCANNING CAN HELP IN THE PROCESS OF 3D MODELING A DIGITAL PROSTHESIS
WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS HOW TO MAKE THESE TWO THINGS WORK TOGETHER
USING MY MORNING AND EVENING COMMUTES TO DWELL OVER ENDLESS IDEAS OF HOW ELSE WE COULD BE USING 3D PRINTERS
WAS SO OFF I FELT ASHAMED I FELT ASHAMED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I KNEW THAT RI ARDS HAD PROMISED TO SHOW
WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS THAT THE NEXT TIME WHEN RI ARDS GROWS OUT OF HIS PROSTHESIS IN ONE YEAR
HIS MOM WILL NOT BE COMING TO OUR OFFICE ANYMORE
SHE WILL TAKE HER SMARTPHONE OPEN AN APP
DO A QUICK 3D SCAN
PREPARE SOME MODIFICATIONS AND SEND THE DESIGN TO THE CLOSEST 3D PRINTER AVAILABLE TO HER
LIKE PO INA WHEN SHE LEAVES FOR THE PARALYMPIC GAMES WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE A 3D MODEL OF HER BRACE WITH HER AND IN CASE SHE BREAKS THE BACK SUPPORT SHE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND THE CLOSEST 3D PRINTING SHOP AND MAKE A NEW ONE
THIS MEANS THE AVAILABILITY OF 3D PRINTERS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF SMARTPHONES IS NOT GOING TO BE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE
WE MODELED AND 3D PRINTED HER AN INDIVIDUALLY FITTED LOWER BACK BRACE AND IN THE MODELING PROCESS THERE WERE NO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS OR PROFESSIONAL 3D DESIGNERS PRESENT
TWO YEARS AGO A LADY NAMED LEVA CAME INTO OUR OFFICE
OUR OFFICE IS A 3D PRINTING CENTER WITH SEVERAL 3D PRINTERS CAPABLE OF PRINTING ALMOST ANYTHING
STARTING FROM AN IPHONE CASE TO A COMPLICATED EDUCATIONAL MODEL FOR MEDICINE
AND EVEN END USE PARTS FOR AIRPLANES
IEVA ASKED IF WE COULD 3D PRINT A PROSTHETIC HAND FOR HER 6 YEAR OLD SON
SHE COULD
FUTURE THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON ANY SMARTPHONE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXTERNAL GADGETS
THIS COULD BE A JOB THAT 3D PRINTERS CAN CERTAINLY HANDLE NO ARMY OF 3D DESIGNERS COULD DO THIS
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LIMITED OR NO SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE
PERSON IN NEED WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE AN ARTIFICIALLY FITTED AND CUSTOMIZED PROSTHESIS
ADJUSTING IT TO THE 3D SCAN ANATOMY EVENTUALLY CREATING A CUSTOMIZED PROSTHESIS TAILORED TO EVERYONE INDIVIDUALLY
BIT HOWEVER IS THAT THIS HAPPENS WITH LITTLE OR NO HUMAN INPUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO TEACH ANY OF YOU TO USE THIS SOFTWARE TO PROCESS A SINGLE PROSTHETIC IN 15 MINUTES OR LESS
WE ALSO FORGOT TO NOTE DOWN WHICH OF HIS HANDS HE NEEDED THE PROSTHESIS FOR
COULDN'T BE DONE BY PROFESSIONAL DESIGNERS BECAUSE IT IS JUST WAY TOO LONG TO PROCESS ONE CASE
IT DOESN'T COME EVEN CLOSE TO HELPING EVERYONE IN NEED
DISTRACTED FROM THE EVER REWARDING PROCESS OF BROKERING NON BANKING DEBT BY WATCHING A YOUTUBE VIDEO EXPLAINING 3D PRINTING
INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHM THEN LEARNS FROM EACH NEW
IPAD'S CAMERA CAN PICK IT UP AND MAKE IT INTO A 3D MODEL
SO DO WE GO ON A HIRING SPREE TO GET AS MANY PROFESSIONAL 3D DESIGNERS AS WE CAN TO FILL THIS VALLEY OF NO DESIGNS
IT'S NO WONDER THE GENERIC DESIGN OF THE INTERNET DIDN'T REALLY WORK FOR RI ARDS
SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION TO THAT IS HE DID NOT DEVELOP ANY FINGERS WHILE HE WAS IN HIS MOM'S WOMB
PROFESSIONAL DESIGNERS' TIME TO PREPARE PROSTHETIC FOR EVERYONE
NOT THE PRIMARY PRODUCT THIS LED ME TO THINK WHAT IS THE PRIMARY PRODUCT WHY IS IT THE REASON THAT WE KILL
MIGHT NOT LITERALLY EXIST LET'S FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE LET'S FOCUS ON AN EXAMPLE LESS ON HOW
IMPACT YOUR LIFE AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU ON THIS NOTE THERE'S A LOT MORE THAN JUST A FRIENDLY FACE BEHIND YOUR FURRY FRIEND THANK YOU
SO WHAT I CHALLENGE YOU TO DO TODAY IS TO GO OUTSIDE AND
MY HA MOMENT CAME WHEN I MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO IN 2007 AND STUDIED PERMACULTURE
WITH THREE BINS I HAD NEVER SEEN THIS THREE BIN CONCEPT COMING FROM NEW ENGLAND THERE WAS A COMPOST RECYCLING AND LANDFILL OPTION WHAT
EATEN YOU COULD GRAB MELON OUT OF THIS PILE CUT IT OPEN AND EAT IT THERE'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH WASTE AT THE SOURCE
WE'RE CREATING TOO MUCH OF IT 40 OF ALL FOOD IS WASTED THAT'S RIDICULOUS
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL STUFF COMING FROM GROCERY STORES THAT MAYBE DIDN'T LOOK SO GOOD OR BECAUSE OF LEGAL REASONS ISN'T GETTING INTO PEOPLES' MOUTHS WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT
YOU JUST WATCH PEOPLE ALMOST LIKE A ROBOT JUST THROWING FORKS KNIVES SPOONS SALT AND PEPPER INTO A BAG THEN WALKING OUT THE DOOR AND YOU JUST SIT BACK AND SAY
MAN I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE THAT PERSON EAT A SANDWICH WITH A SPOON THAT WOULD BE
SOMETHING ELSE I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY JUST GRABBED ALL THOSE THINGS
AND WHAT YOU START TO REALIZE IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE THESE HABITS WHERE THEY JUST AUTOMATICALLY DO THINGS SO WE STARTED TO CHANGE THAT BY FIRST TAKING AWAY THE PLASTIC UTENSILS PUTTING THEM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND IF THEY WANTED THEM THEY COULD HAVE THEM WE WEREN'T SAYING YOU CAN'T EVER USE THIS
AGAIN ALSO TRAINING THE STAFF TO SAY IS THAT FOR HERE OR TO GO
IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE QUESTION BUT IT'S POWERFUL
IT'S EITHER A MUG OR PAPER CUP WITH A LID ON IT
DO YOU REALLY NEED A BAG TO CARRY YOUR SANDWICH WHICH IS ALREADY WRAPPED ACROSS THE STREET
NO YOU REALLY DON'T SO YOU GET
NEVER SEE THE WORLD THE SAME I STARTED TO LOOK AT LITTLE THINGS AT THIS CAFE WE COULD DO TO LESSEN OUR IMPACT ONE THING WE NOTICED WHEN WE STARTED STUDYING THE WAY OUR CUSTOMERS INTERACTED IN THE SPACE WAS
THESE LOADS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THIS IS ME GEEKING OUT ON COMPOST BUT
YOU ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT WAY I IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO MAKE SMALL CHANGES IN MY LIFE
I SOLD MY CAR STARTED COMMUTING 14 MILES A DAY BY BIKE
I STARTED COMPOSTING I STARTED MY FIRST GARDEN THEY WERE BOTH MISERABLE FAILURES AT MY FIRST ATTEMPTS MY COMPOST WAS MORE LIKE SOUP I'VE COME A LONG WAY
BUT
WHAT THAT DID WAS IT
INSPIRED US TO MAKE THESE SMALL CHANGES ON A DAILY BASIS AND REALIZE THAT THIS WOULD DEFINITELY ADD UP OVER TIME
ON TOP OF THIS THIS WAS A COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT EMBRACED THIS TYPE OF MINDSET
PROPERLY AND I WAS ABLE TO THEN BECAUSE I'M GEEKING OUT HARD ON THIS PERMACULTURE THING GO TO MY OWNER AND SAY HEY WE'RE SAVING MONEY CAN WE TRY TO ATTEMPT THIS COMPOST THING AND
GARBAGE TRUCKS DO AND IT'S A CLEAN DIESEL SO YOU'LL NEVER SEE BLACK
EMISSIONS COMING OUT OF THAT EXHAUST PIPE ON THIS TRUCK IT'S TAKEN TO OUR FACILITY WE COMBINE IT WITH A CARBON SOURCE MAINLY LEAF WASTE AND WE PUT IT THROUGH MIXER THAT WAS MADE BY A LOCAL COMPANY
AND THEN THE MAGIC HAPPENS
I SHOW THIS PICTURE TO KIDS
AND I ASK THEM TO GIVE ME ONE WORD THAT DESCRIBES HOW IT MAKES THEM FEEL
AND I HEAR SICK
DISGUSTED
SAD
WASTEFUL
AND POWERLESS
WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT
PART ABOUT THIS AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I STARTED THIS COMPANY WAS THAT RIPPLE EFFECT THOUGH EVERYONE AT THESE BUSINESSES GOES TO WORK
ON A DAILY BASIS AND THEY START THIS PROCESS AND
THEY'RE GOING TO GO HOME AFTER WORK OR AFTER SCHOOL AND SAY WHY AREN'T WE DOING THIS
AT HOME WHY AREN'T WE DOING THIS AT SCHOOL SO YOU HAVE THAT RIPPLE EFFECT THAT THE STUDENTS AND THESE PEOPLE IN THESE RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED WILL NEVER LOOK AT THE WORLD THE SAME THEY'LL ALWAYS QUESTION
WHY AREN'T WE COMPOSTING THIS MAKES SENSE
TAKING OUR GARBAGE OUT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS THAT WAS IT
SO WITH THIS PROCESS I ALSO REALIZED THERE WAS A GREATER COMMUNITY NEED FOR THIS SERVICE OF COMPOST HAULING
SO WE STARTED MR FOX COMPOSTING WE STARTED OUT WITH A PICK UP TRUCK AND A DUMP TRAILER AND IT WAS A
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE LIKE A WRUNG OUT SPONGE WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE MICROBES TO THRIVE WHEN
OR COMPOSTABLE SO THEY REALLY GENERATED NO WASTE AND IT WAS AN AMAZING FIRST THING FOR ME TO SEE WHAT
WAS ALSO AMAZING WAS
IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY HAD THE OPTION
FOR YOU TO PUSH YOUR ORGANICS OR YOUR FOOD WASTE CURBSIDE THEY TOOK MEAT DAIRY BONES AND ALL YOUR YARD TRIMMINGS I HAD NEVER
KNIVES SPOONS WERE ALL MADE FROM CORN AND POTATO STARCH AND EVERYTHING THEY GAVE THEIR CUSTOMERS WAS EITHER
THE ALTERNATIVE FOR FOOD WASTE IF IT'S NOT ENDING UP IN A COMPOST FACILITY
SPENT LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TIME IN HIS OFFICE AS A KID GROWING UP
THESE KIDS
ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME SEEING THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR THEY'VE SPENT A WHOLE YEAR TEACHING THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS HOW TO SEPARATE THEIR FOOD WASTE THIS IS THEIR A HA MOMENT THIS IS WHERE THEY REALIZE EVERYTHING COMES FULL
TO HAVE A TIPPER TO TIP THE CART WE WERE DOING IT ALL BY HAND AND
IT QUICKLY GREW
NOW WE'VE GOT OVER 100 COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES WE'VE GOT 15 SCHOOLS WE'VE GOT NURSING HOMES HOSPITALS RESTAURANTS AND CAFES WE HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED RESIDENTS WE WORK WITH WE ALSO HAVE MUNICIPAL PROJECTS WHERE WE HAVE
RESIDENTS BRING THEIR FOOD SCRAPS TO THE MUNICIPALITIES AT THE TRANSFER STATION WE
IT DID WAS IT GAVE YOU THE ABILITY TO SEE HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE YOU WERE HAVING ON THE ENVIRONMENT ON A DAILY BASIS AND THEN I WAS CHANGED LIKE EVERYONE WHO TOOK THE COURSE YOU NOW HAD
MOST PEOPLE WILL ASK US HOW COMPOST WORKS THEY SAY DO YOU ADD AN OUTSIDE HEATING ELEMENT IS IT THE SUN
NO IT'S MICROBES AND I GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS WHEN I DO TALKS WE SAY THIS IS MRS AND MR PACMAN DOING WORK THEY'RE GOING TO TOWN
I WENT TO COMPOST SCHOOL
THERE IS SUCH A THING
THE THING THAT STUCK WITH ME MOST WAS AS COMPOSTER YOU'RE CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR MICROBES TO THRIVE
AFTER I HEARD THAT I WAS LIKE OK I GET IT NOW THIS MAKES SENSE YOU'RE AN ALCHEMIST YOU NEED THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CARBON WHICH IS THE DEAD BROWN STUFF THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF NITROGEN WHICH IS THE LIVE GREEN
WE DOING THIS EVERYWHERE THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS EVERYWHERE THIS IS SO GREAT WHEN I CAM HOME I HAD THESE PERMI LENSES ON THE FIRST JOB I GOT WAS AT A LITTLE LOCAL CAFE AND WHEN YOU HAVE THESE
AT THE ROOT OF THE WORD IS PERMANENT AGRICULTURE IT'S A DESIGNED SYSTEM THAT CREATES NO WASTE BECAUSE IT VIEWS IT AS A RESOURCE
THERE WAS A SMALL SQUARE TABLE BOLTED TO THE FLOOR AND TWO METAL CHAIRS ONE ON EITHER SIDE
THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE PRICE OF THEIR FREEDOM AND THAT PRICE IS CALLED BAIL
WHAT'S PERHAPS MORE CONFOUNDING IS IT DOESN'T MAKE US ANY SAFER RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT HOLDING SOMEBODY IN JAIL MAKES YOU SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT A CRIME WHEN YOU GET OUT THAN IF YOU HAD BEEN
LET'S TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE IN JAIL EVEN FOR A FEW DAYS WELL IT CAN MEAN LOSING YOUR
ARE PASSIONATE DEDICATED ADVOCATES FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHOM WERE FORMERLY INCARCERATED
SITS OUT THERE AND HOUSES PRIMARILY BLACK AND BROWN MEN WHO CANNOT PAY THEIR BAIL
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATORS THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS THE ACADEMICS THE MEDIA THE PHILANTHROPISTS THE STUDENTS THE SINGERS THE POETS AND OF COURSE THE VOICES AND EFFORTS OF THOSE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THIS SYSTEM
PEOPLE IN JAIL CELLS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN CONVICTED OF ANYTHING THAT'S 40 MILLION DOLLARS A DAY
BUT ONE LAST THING THOSE PEOPLE SITTING IN AMERICA IN THOSE JAIL CELLS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY WHO ARE HELD IN JAIL ON BAIL BONDAGE RIGHT NOW THEY NEED A LIFELINE TODAY
POWERFUL EVIDENCE THAT WE DON'T NEED CASH OR ANKLE BRACELETS OR UNNECESSARY SYSTEMS OF SURVEILLANCE AND SUPERVISION WE SIMPLY NEED COURT REMINDERS SIMPLE COURT REMINDERS ABOUT WHEN TO COME BACK TO COURT
BAIL AT A TIME FOR AS LONG IT TAKES UNTIL TRUE FREEDOM AND EQUAL JUSTICE ARE A REALITY IN AMERICA THANK YOU
A GROWING NETWORK OF BAIL DISRUPTERS WHO ARE AUDACIOUS ENOUGH TO DREAM BIG AND FIGHT
AND RAMEL HE'S TRAINING RIGHT NOW TO BE A BAIL DISRUPTER IN QUEENS COUNTY NEW
OUR STRATEGY ALSO RELIES ON THE EXPERIENCE AND THE WISDOM AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS INJUSTICE FIRSTHAND
THE UNITED STATES INCARCERATES MORE PEOPLE PER CAPITA THAN ALMOST ANY NATION ON THE PLANET BUT WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS THAT ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN AMERICA ALMOST HALF A MILLION PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP IN THOSE CONCRETE JAIL
LOSING YOUR HOME JEOPARDIZING YOUR IMMIGRATION STATUS IT MAY EVEN MEAN LOSING CUSTODY OF YOUR CHILDREN
JAIL IN AMERICA IS A TERRIFYING DEHUMANIZING AND VIOLENT EXPERIENCE
THE LAST 20 YEARS OF PRE TRIAL INCARCERATION
ARE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN STUCK IN THAT JAIL CELL THAN IF YOU WERE WHITE
A THIRD OF SEXUAL VICTIMIZATION BY JAIL STAFF HAPPENS IN THE FIRST THREE DAYS IN JAIL
AND SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND OFFERS YOU A WAY OUT JUST PLEAD GUILTY THEY SAY YOU CAN GO HOME BACK TO YOUR JOB JUST PLEAD GUILTY YOU CAN KISS YOUR KIDS GOODNIGHT TONIGHT
BAIL WAS NEVER INTENDED TO HOLD PEOPLE IN JAIL CELLS AND BAIL WAS NEVER EVER INTENDED TO CREATE A TWO TIER SYSTEM OF JUSTICE
I AM HERE TO SAY SOMETHING SIMPLE SOMETHING OBVIOUS BUT SOMETHING URGENT
TURNS OUT MONEY ISN'T WHAT MAKES PEOPLE COME BACK TO COURT WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHEN THE BRONX FREEDOM FUND PAYS BAIL 96 PERCENT OF CLIENTS RETURN FOR EVERY COURT
BAIL AT AN AMOUNT THAT SOMEBODY COULD AFFORD TO PAY THEY WOULD PAY IT IT WOULD GIVE THEM AN INCENTIVE TO COME BACK TO COURT IT WOULD GIVE THEM SOME SKIN IN THE GAME
NEED SO WE CAN CHART A BETTER PATH FORWARD SO THAT WE DO NOT RECREATE THIS SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION IN JUST ANOTHER
LATER HE WAS STILL ON THE BOAT LOCKED IN THAT JAIL CELL
EVER RECEIVED A JAIL SENTENCE OF ANY KIND
BUT HERE'S THE THING I KNOW FROM DECADES IN THE SYSTEM REAL SYSTEMIC CHANGE TAKES TIME AND IT TAKES A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF
BUT THE REACH OF THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM HAS GROWN TOO ENORMOUS AND THE NUMBERS HAVE JUST TOO LARGE 99 PERCENT OF JAIL GROWTH IN AMERICA HAS BEEN THE
WE COULD USE IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR MORE AND MORE
NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I VISITED A CLIENT IN JAIL THE HEAVY METAL DOOR SLAMMED BEHIND ME AND I HEARD THE KEY TURN IN THE LOCK
OUR STRATEGY LEVERAGES THE FACT THAT BAIL MONEY COMES BACK AT THE END OF A
CALLING INTO QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ENTIRE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM
BUT WHAT IF CLIENTS DID COME BACK {NS} WE KNEW THAT BAIL MONEY COMES BACK AT THE END OF A CRIMINAL CASE SO IT COULD COME BACK INTO THE FUND
AND ALMOST HALF OF ALL JAIL DEATHS INCLUDING SUICIDES HAPPEN IN THAT FIRST WEEK
HE WAS ON THE CUSP OF LOSING EVERYTHING AND HE WAS ABOUT TO PLEAD GUILTY AND THE BRONX FREEDOM FUND INTERVENED AND PAID HIS BAIL
IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING BIG IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING BOLD IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING MAYBE AUDACIOUS
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WELL THAT'S THE QUESTION I WAS WRESTLING WITH OVER A DECADE AGO WHEN I WAS SITTING AT KITCHEN TABLE WITH MY HUSBAND DAVID WHO IS ALSO A PUBLIC DEFENDER WE WERE EATING OUR CHINESE TAKEOUT AND VENTING ABOUT THE INJUSTICE OF IT ALL WHEN DAVID LOOKED UP AND SAID
WHY DON'T WE JUST START A BAIL FUND AND JUST START BAILING OUR CLIENTS OUT OF JAIL AND IN THAT UNEXPECTED MOMENT THE IDEA FOR THE BRONX FREEDOM FUND WAS BORN
AND I NEVER HAVE IT INSPIRED ME TO FIGHT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF MY CLIENTS' FREEDOM AS IF IT WAS MY OWN
JAILING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY BAIL IS ONE OF
NOW IMAGINE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT THAT IT'S YOU STUCK IN THAT JAIL CELL AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE 500 DOLLARS TO GET OUT
PEOPLE COME BACK TO COURT AND HOW THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM ITSELF IS OPERATED
COLLECT AND ELEVATE AND HONOR THE STORIES OF OUR CLIENTS SO THAT WE CAN CHANGE HEARTS AND MINDS
AND FREEDOM SHOULD BE FREE
WE WANT TO TAKE OUR PROVEN REVOLVING BAIL FUND MODEL THAT WE BUILT IN THE BRONX AND SPREAD IT ACROSS
I HAVE WATCHED AS QUESTIONS OF JUSTICE WERE SUBSUMED BY QUESTIONS OF
BUT NOW YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD THAT'S GOING TO FOLLOW YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
WHEN HE DEMANDED TO KNOW WHY HE WAS BEING STOPPED AN ARGUMENT ENSUED AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW HE WAS ON THE GROUND IN HANDCUFFS BEING CHARGED WITH RIDING YOUR BICYCLE ON THE
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTOOD VISCERALLY JUST FOR A FLEETING MOMENT WHAT INCARCERATION MIGHT FEEL LIKE
LOOK WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT TOLD US WE WERE CRAZY AND WE WERE GOING TO LOSE ALL OF THE MONEY PEOPLE WOULDN'T COME BACK BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY STAKE IN IT
SHOULD WE SMILE MORE AND HOW DO WE SMILE TODAY I'M GOING TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
SO ANYONE OF YOU HERE IS A CHOCOLATE LOVER OH
GIVE THE TEACHER A SMILE WHEN YOU SEE HIM HER OR HIM
GIVE A NEW FRIEND AT SCHOOL A LITTLE SMILE
GIVE YOUR PARENTS A HUGE HUG AND A BIG SMILE WHEN YOU COME HOME FROM SCHOOL
THEY DESERVE IT
TO QUOTE A MOVIE THAT IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE THAT HAS ALSO BEEN PRESENTED HERE THE BOOK OF LIFE'
YOU CAN WRITE THE STORY OF YOURSELF SO WHY NOT START WRITING THAT STORY BY A SMILE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING AND HAPPY HALLOWEEN
AND REMEMBERING OF HOME HE WOULD HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO STAND ON THIS AMAZING STAGE WITH THIS MESMERIZING CROWD OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF SMILES
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LITTLE THINGS COULD DO TO YOU
WELL I AM THAT LITTLE BOY
SO COMING HERE TODAY I ONLY HAVE ONE CHALLENGE TO
A SMILE SOUNDS SIMPLE ENOUGH RIGHT WELL AS SIMPLE AS IT MAY SOUND A SMILE IS A VERY
HE WANTED TO GO HOME WITH HIS PARENTS HE WANTED TO QUIT EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE HE LOOKED WAS THE SIGHT OF HIS FAMILY OF HIS FRIENDS IT WAS ON A SATURDAY
WELL NOW WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A HUGE BAR OF HERSHEY OR REECE'S IN OUR POCKET
SO SOME OF YOU HERE MAY BE THINKING OH THIS GUY IS SO BORING WHY IS HE LECTURING US ABOUT SCIENCE I WANT TO GO BACK HOME AND PLAY GAMES PLAY MINECRAFT
WELL THE ULTIMATE REASON OF WHY I'M HERE TODAY IS NOT TO LECTURE YOU ABOUT SCIENCE OR ABOUT ANYTHING
BUT IT IS TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY TO ULTIMATELY CONVINCE YOU TO SMILE MORE EVERY DAY
SO THIS STORY
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY IN A LITTLE PLACE WHO LOVES LOVES TO DREAMS OF COMING TO A PLACE CALLED AMERICA
TO HIM THAT LAND IS THE DREAM LAND IT IS THE LAND OF FREE WHERE ALL DREAMS COME TRUE WHERE UNICORNS FLY IN THE SKY
WELL I MEAN THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT ANYWAY
SO
ONLY A FEW MONTHS EARLIER HIS DREAM TURNED TO REALITY WHEN WITH THE HELP OF HIS FRIENDS AND HIS FAMILY HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO STEP FOOT ON AMERICAN GROUND
AS HEARING THE RAIN TAPPING CLICKETY CLICK ON YOUR DOORSTEP OR MAYBE COMPLETING A NEW X BOX CHALLENGE A LOT OF SORTS OF EMOTIONS COULD
THIS PEAK OF EMOTION BUT NOW THAT WE'VE KNOWN THE DEFINITION OF A SMILE WHAT
TREE SPROUT IT WAS AS SMALL AS HIS
WELL I GUESS I'M EXTREME ALL THE TIME THEN WELL I MEAN YEAH I
THIS WAS ABOUT FIVE CHILDREN WHO THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN COULDN'T LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES SO
OLD I WAS LIVING IN A FLAT ON MY OWN USING SLEEPING PILLS JUST TO SLEEP MY LIFE AWAY BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET THE NEIGHBOUR THAT USED TO COME AND CHECK ON ME AND THE NEIGHBOUR THAT GOT ME HELP WHEN I NEEDED IT
SO BET YOU'RE WONDERING HOW DID THESE PEOPLE MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND WELL IF THAT'S WHAT THEY LEAVE CARE WITH I'LL TELL YOU
TEN ISN'T EVEN A BIG NUMBER I KNOW SOME KIDS THAT HAVE HAD 50 HOMES AND THE RESULT OF LEAVING
US GO INTO CARE BECAUSE OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT
IT WASN'T OUR FAULT
BUT THE CARE SYSTEM MADE ME FEEL LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT BECAUSE EVERYTHING I DID WAS WRITTEN DOWN AND ANALYSED
EVEN MY FRIENDS HAD TO BE POLICE CHECKED
SO I REBELLED AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY
I EVEN RAN AWAY
BY THAT FAMILY
THE CARE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE A SUBSTITUTE FOR FAMILY LIFE
BUT LOVE IS NOT PART OF THE DEAL
CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING IN A SYSTEM
CHILDREN'S HOMES LOOK MORE LIKE INSTITUTIONS AND FOSTER CARERS DON'T NEED TO LOVE THE CHILDREN THEY CARE
FEAR DOESN'T HAVE TO WIN THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT STOOD THEIR GROUND BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN EQUALITY THAT'S ALL WE WANT AN EQUAL CHANCE AT LIFE THE CARE
YOU DO YOU THINK THE SUFFRAGETTES LET FEAR WIN WHEN THEY WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE
CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING TO SIGN YOUR POCKET MONEY OUT IN FORMAL FORM OR GOING TO THE BEACH BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO IN THE WATER BECAUSE THERE'S NOT FIRST AIDER ON DUTY
I REMEMBER AFTER ONE VISIT I WENT BACK TO THE CHILDREN'S HOME I WAS IN AND I WAS MET BY A WONDERFUL WOMAN CALLED WENDY WENDY SAT ME DOWN AND SHE SAID LAURA IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT YOUR MUM CAN'T COPE BUT
SO MUCH SO THAT I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD A VISIT WITH MY LITTLE SISTER WE DECIDED TO HANDCUFF EACH OTHER TOGETHER WE HAD TO GET TAKEN DOWN TO THE FIRE STATION AND GET SAWN APART WE GOT IN LOT OF TROUBLE FOR THAT ONE BUT
KIDS IN CARE ARE LABELED AND THEY'RE JUDGED
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT
I LIVED IT
I SAW IT LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS IN A CHURCH HALL SURROUNDED BY 300 PEOPLE PROTESTING THE BUILD OF A CHILDREN'S HOME
THIS IS WHAT THOSE PEOPLE HAD TO SAY HOW SAFE ARE WE
BUT WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES
IN FACT WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO PRISON THAN UNIVERSITY
50 OF US LEAVE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE
AND WE'RE 20 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BY THE TIME WE GET TO 25
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THAT WAS YOUR CHILD
HERE'S A RADICAL THOUGHT
THESE ARE YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY'RE CRYING OUT FOR YOUR HELP
I COULDN'T SPEAK
WENDY HELD MY HAND AND SHE SAID LAURA I KNOW
ALL YOU WANT IS TO BE LOVED
AND FELL APART IN THAT WOMAN'S ARMS AND SHE CUDDLED ME IN LIKE I WAS HER OWN CHILD
I KEPT LOOKING UP AT HER
BECAUSE SHE HAD THIS STRUGGLE IN HER EYES AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS AT THE TIME
BUT I KNOW NOW WENDY WAS AN EMPLOYEE SHE WAS A WORKER
SHE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TELL ME THAT SHE LOVED ME
SO NOT LONG AFTER THAT MY BEHAVIOUR GOT WORSE AND WORSE SO MUCH SO THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE
SO I TOOK A SERIOUS ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE AND THAT LANDED ME LOCKED UP IN A SECURE UNIT FOR MY OWN SAFETY
BECAUSE NOBODY COULD SEE THE
WEE GIRL
A PART OF MY IDENTITY THAT I'VE NEVER OWNED FOR A LONG TIME THAT I TOO HAD BEEN IN CARE BUT THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT CONTINUE TO JUDGE US AND WANT US TO BE SILENCED THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT
DO WE DO ABOUT IT WELL FOR MOST ADULTS IT'S A RELATIVELY MILD DISEASE A LITTLE FEVER A LITTLE
MEDICAL DOCTORS ANOTHER YEAR TO BE SURE THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY THE ZIKA VIRUS BUT THEY'RE NOW SURE AND IF YOU'RE
THAT WHEN THEY RELEASED IT THEY COULD FOLLOW EXACTLY HOW FAR IT WENT HOW LONG IT LIVED AND ALL OF THE KINDS OF DATA FOR A GOOD SCIENTIFIC STUDY
THAT LED TO AN EXPLOSIVE OUTBREAK IN WHICH ALMOST 30000 PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED FROM THERE IT RADIATED AROUND THE PACIFIC THERE WERE OUTBREAKS IN THE COOK ISLANDS IN NEW CALEDONIA IN VANUATU IN THE SOLOMON
THEN WHEN THEY LAND THE LOCAL MOSQUITOES BEGIN TO BITE THEM AND SPREAD THE FEVER
THIS EDITORIAL WAS TO INTRODUCE READERS TO HOW WE CAN DO THAT TODAY NOT WITH RADIATION BUT WITH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENETICS LET ME EXPLAIN
AND THERE'S NO KNOWN CURE IT WAS ACTUALLY DOCTORS IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL WHO FIRST NOTICED JUST A YEAR
ALMOST ALL THE WAY AROUND TO THE COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA AND EASTER ISLAND
GETTING VACCINATED IS NOT AN OPTION BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A VACCINE YET AND THERE PROBABLY WON'T BE FOR COUPLE OF YEARS
STAYING HOME
ISN'T A FOOLPROOF
PROTECTION EITHER BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW THAT IT CAN BE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
COVERING UP AND APPLYING INSECT REPELLENT DOES WORK
UNTIL YOU FORGET
TORTUROUS STORY OF GM REGULATION IN THE US
PREVENTING INFECTION IS EITHER ABOUT PROTECTING PEOPLE OR ABOUT ELIMINATING THE MOSQUITOES
THE VIRUS WASN'T DENGUE IT WAS ZIKA AND IT SPREAD RAPIDLY
BEES ARE THE GOOD GUYS THE
AND EAST THROUGH EQUATORIAL ASIA PAKISTAN INDIA MALAYSIA INDONESIA BUT IT WAS STILL MOSTLY IN
AND BACK AND FORTH TO CONVINCE THE FDA THAT THIS WOULD NOT HARM
THE FIRST HUMAN CASES OF ZIKA FEVER SURFACED A FEW YEARS LATER IN UGANDA TANZANIA THE VIRUS THEN SPREAD THROUGH WEST
WISH I COULD TELL YOU THIS IS AN AMERICAN CITY BUT IT'S NOT
IT'S PIRACICABA BRAZIL
THE AMAZING THING
IS THAT IN JUST A YEAR
IT BROUGHT DOWN THE CASES OF DENGUE BY 91 PERCENT
THAT'S BETTER
ZIKA FEVER OUR NEWEST DREAD DISEASE WHAT IS IT WHERE'D IT COME FROM
THE GENETICALLY MODIFIED MOSQUITO AND THEY WOULD DO IT AS A NEW ANIMAL DRUG IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE TOOK THEM ANOTHER
UNTIL THIS YEAR THE MANY THOUSANDS OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED IN THE US WERE CONTRACTED ELSEWHERE
AND THEY DEMANDED A REFERENDUM WHICH WILL BE CONDUCTED IN JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS ABOUT WHETHER THE TRIALS WOULD BE PERMITTED AT
LINE IS THIS BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF HARMFUL INSECTS
CAN BE BOTH MORE EFFECTIVE AND VERY MUCH MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
THAN USING
INSECTICIDES WHICH ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT WAS TRUE IN RACHEL CARSON'S TIME
IT'S TRUE TODAY WHAT'S DIFFERENT
IS THAT WE HAVE ENORMOUSLY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT GENETICS THAN WE HAD THEN AND THEREFORE MORE ABILITY
TO USE THAT INFORMATION
TO AFFECT THESE BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS
PARTIALLY OR EVEN TOTALLY PARALYZE YOU FORTUNATELY THAT'S QUITE RARE AND MOST PEOPLE RECOVER
THIS BOOK SHE TELLS THE STORY AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A VERY NASTY INSECT PEST OF LIVESTOCK WAS ELIMINATED IN THE LAST CENTURY NO ONE
PEOPLE AS WELL AS BUGS ALTHOUGH IT DOES TAKE QUITE LOT MORE TO KILL PERSON THAN TO KILL A BUG THESE ARE
AND IT WOULD NOT HARM THE ENVIRONMENT
THEY FINALLY GAVE THEM THIS SUMMER PERMISSION TO RUN A LITTLE
TEST IN THE FLORIDA KEYS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN INVITED YEARS EARLIER WHEN THEY KEYS HAD AN OUTBREAK
OF DENGUE
TOOK THESE FOLKS TWO YEARS TO DECIDE THAT IT WOULD BE THE FDA
SO DID THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ZIKA FEVER CASES
AND OF COURSE MOSQUITOES
IN FACT IN THE 60 YEARS BETWEEN THE TIME IT WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IN 1947
AND 2007 THERE WERE ONLY 13 REPORTED CASES OF HUMAN ZIKA FEVER
AND THEN SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENED ON THE TINY
DOCTORS HAVE NOTICED AN UPTICK OF SOMETHING CALLED GUILLAIN BARR SYNDROME IN RECENT OUTBREAKS IN GUILLAIN BARR YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS YOUR NERVE CELLS IT CAN
WAY THAT I CAN USE MODERN AND DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO TELL STORIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TELL DIFFERENT KINDS OF STORIES THAT MAYBE I COULDN'T TELL USING THE TRADITIONAL TOOLS OF FILMMAKING THAT WE'VE BEEN USING FOR 100 YEARS
LIKE REAL LIFE IT FEELS LIKE TRUTH AND YOU FEEL PRESENT IN THE WORLD THAT YOU'RE INSIDE AND YOU FEEL PRESENT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE INSIDE OF IT WITH SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A DEMO OF A
PEOPLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE OF THE FILMS AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE
RIGHT NOW TO SHOOT A WHOLE SERIES OF THESE FILMS WE JUST FINISHED SHOOTING STORY IN LIBERIA AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT A STORY IN INDIA AND
VIRTUAL REALITY LET'S TALK ABOUT VIRTUAL REALITY UNFORTUNATELY TALKING ABOUT
HUMANS
TO OTHER HUMANS
IN PROFOUND WAY THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN ANY OTHER FORM OF MEDIA
AND IT CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF EACH OTHER
AND THAT'S HOW I THINK VIRTUAL REALITY HAS THE POTENTIAL
TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WORLD
EMPATHETIC AND WE BECOME MORE CONNECTED AND ULTIMATELY
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS NOT A VIEW INTO THE WORLD IT'S BASICALLY THE WHOLE
SO WE'RE SHOOTING IN EVERY DIRECTION THIS IS A CAMERA SYSTEM THAT WE BUILT
VIRTUAL REALITY STARTED FOR ME IN SORT OF AN UNUSUAL PLACE IT WAS THE 1970S I GOT INTO THE FIELD VERY YOUNG I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD
WHAT DO THEY REPRESENT
AND FRAME IS JUST A WINDOW
I MEAN ALL THE MEDIA THAT WE WATCH TELEVISION CINEMA THEY'RE THESE WINDOWS INTO THESE OTHER WORLDS
AND I THOUGHT
WELL GREAT I GOT YOU IN A FRAME BUT I DON'T WANT YOU IN THE FRAME I DON'T WANT YOU IN THE WINDOW I WANT YOU THROUGH THE WINDOW I WANT YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE
IN THE WORLD
AND IT WAS MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR VIRTUAL REALITY COMPANY CALLED VRSE AND THE UNITED NATIONS AND A CO COLLABORATOR NAMED GABO ARORA AND WE WENT TO A SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN JORDAN IN DECEMBER AND SHOT THE
SHARE ONE SPECIAL PROPERTY EACH OF THEM HAS ONE OR MORE CHAINS OF TINY MAGNETIC CRYSTALS CALLED MAGNETISMS THESE MAGNETISM CHAINS ACTUALLY ROTATE THE
BE DONE WITH PRETTY MUCH ANY OLD BACTERIA WHY SPECIFICALLY MAGNETIC BACTERIA
WELL
THEY HELP US BOTH WITH READING AND WRITING THE DATA
IF YOU WOULD USE ANOTHER TYPE OF BACTERIA FOR READING IT YOU'D NEED TO EMPLOY VERY COMPLEX MECHANISMS TO DETECT WHERE YOU HAVE BACTERIA
MEANWHILE
THESE
TO ZEROS AND ONES WHEN IT'S STORED
NOWADAYS THESE ARE REPRESENTED BY MAGNETIZATION MAKING DENTS AND VARIOUS OTHER WAYS
WHY NOT REPRESENT THEM BY STORING BACTERIA
UNLIKE METAL AND PLASTIC BACTERIA ARE LIVING CREATURES AND THUS DUPLICATE
AND THIS ALLOWS US THE FANTASTIC ABILITY OF HAVING OUR DATA DUPLICATE ITSELF
HOW
LET'S REPRESENT
OUR DATA IN ROOMS
WHEN WE WANT TO
AT THE INTERNATIONAL INTEL ISEF COMPETITION IN WHICH I PARTICIPATED AFTER I COMPETED AT THE SCIENCE
FOR THE BACTERIA TO DUPLICATE INTO
AND LET THE BACTERIA DO WHAT THEY DO BEST IT'S ALMOST SET IT AND FORGET IT
BUT NOT ONLY DO THE BACTERIA DO THE WORK FOR YOU
THEY CAN ALSO DO IT MUCH FASTER FOR MASS AMOUNTS OF COPIES
NOWADAYS HOWEVER YOU DUPLICATE DATA YOU PRETTY MUCH CAN'T GET AWAY FROM LINEAR RATE
OUR
HOW IT CAN BE USED IN A SURPRISING WAY
MAGNETIC BACTERIA
ARE TINY ORGANISMS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HUMANS HEALTH AND DISEASE
UNLIKE THE COMMON CONCEPTION OF BACTERIA
THEY LIVE IN MANY DIFFERENT AQUATIC HABITATS AROUND THE GLOBE
OF COURSE I STARTED THINKING OF POSSIBLE METHODS FOR BACTERIA BASED STORAGE WITH ROTTEN I CHANGED IMPROVED AND REFINED IT UNTIL WE GOT TO A CONCEPT AND THIS IS HOW IT WORKS
ONE DAY WHEN YOU BUY A COMPUTER IT'LL HAVE A MAGNETIC BACTERIA READING DRIVE IN IT THANK YOU
SHOWED ME PHOTOS HE'D FOUND ONLINE OF THEM
LIKE ROTEM I FOUND IT FASCINATING AND SPENT THE NEXT FEW WEEKS DIGGING UP INFORMATION ON MAGNETIC BACTERIA AND READING SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ABOUT THEM
ONE NIGHT I WAS LYING IN BED UNABLE TO FALL ASLEEP
WONDERING ABOUT THE MAGNETIC BACTERIA
WHEN
FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I'LL JUST SAY THAT I VOW TO LIVE MY LIFE IN A WAY THAT DETERS OTHERS FROM FOLLOWING IN THAT FOOTSTEP
ME 200 DOLLARS IN CASH TOLD ME CONGRATULATIONS AND I WAS ORDERED TO
BUT PEOPLE SEEMED TO THINK THAT THEY KNEW BETTER FOR ME
THAN WHAT I KNEW FOR MYSELF
AND THAT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO DEAL WITH
WHEN YOU'RE FORCED TO SIT
IN AN ELEMENTARY PROGRAM
AND YOU'RE WORKING AT COLLEGE LEVEL
AS I WALKED OUT THE FRONT DOOR THAT MORNING I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A DOPE HOUSE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE TRANSITIONAL PLACE
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHERE THE HELL DID THEY PUT ME AT THE NEXT DAY
AND MOST OF SOCIETY HAVE THESE EXPECTATIONS ON US THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF PRISON AND WE'RE THESE HARDENED CRIMINALS AND WE NEED TO BE IN A PROGRAM THAT TEACHES YOU HOW TO FILL OUT A JOB RESUME
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT BECAUSE I COULDN'T SLEEP I WAITED UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE GUARD CAME BY ESCORTED ME FROM NORTH BLOCK
THERE WERE PILES OF TRASH ON THE CORNER AS THOUGH IT WERE A DUMP SITE
THEY EITHER RAN AWAY FROM THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSE OR WERE EITHER ARRESTED SOME OF THEM WERE OUT ON DOPE ROAMING UP AND DOWN THE STREET LOST
TO EMBRACE ME I'M ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT I'M DOING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TODAY
WITHIN THE FIRST 60 DAYS OF BEING IN THAT HOUSE I WATCHED NO LESS THAN 30 MEN SUCCUMB TO THE PRESSURES OF THAT ENVIRONMENT
AND THE WAY THAT I HAD PROTECTED MYSELF IN THE PAST WAS FOR ME TO PICK UP A PISTOL AND FIGHT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT CAME MY WAY I THOUGHT WAS THREAT
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE DEPENDING ON MY SUCCESS AND ON THE OTHER
AND I TOLD HER THAT I WAS HOME AND SHE THOUGHT IT
ANY PROFESSOR IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR BEYOND THAT UNTIL YOU'VE SPENT 25 YEARS INSIDE OF A PRISON SYSTEM YOU DON'T KNOW MORE THAN WHAT WE KNOW IN THIS ROOM ABOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM
BE TOLD IF IT WASN'T FOR MY EX WIFE I WOULD'VE BEEN TOTALLY LOST
I WAS PAROLED INTO AN AREA I'VE NEVER LIVED IN NEVER BEEN IN BEFORE
AND WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET THERE
LATER THAT NIGHT
I PULLED UP
TO THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSE CHECKED IN
IT WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE STANDING OF THEIR PROGRAMS CURRENTLY OPERATING INSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION
ALSO WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE VICTIMS OF MY CRIME AND IN THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TO WHOM I OWE AN APOLOGY
AS OPPOSED TO LIVED PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE I CHALLENGE
PERIOD OF MY INCARCERATION OVER 900000 DOLLARS WERE PAID TO KEEP ME IN PRISON BUT WHEN I PAROLED I WAS GIVEN 200 DOLLARS AND TOLD GOOD LUCK THANK YOU
WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION I'D JUST SIGNED A TRIGGER LOCK LAW MY INTENT IS TO STAY FREE WHICH I WILL STAY FREE
BUT SOMEHOW IT'S NOT OK FOR THE STUDENT TO BECOME A TEACHER
THERE ARE MEN WHO I HAVE LEARNED FROM
THERE ARE MEN I CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM
AND
SINCE BEING HOME
THERE ARE ABOUT AT LEAST 50 MEN THAT I KNOW WHO HAVE PAROLED FROM SAN QUENTIN WHO ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE DOING GREAT WORK
THEY'RE
CHOSEN TO TALK ABOUT IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE RELEASED BACK INTO A SOCIETY THAT IS NOT READY TO RECEIVE ME
THERE'S THIS IMPRESSION AS THOUGH THERE'S ONE KIND OF MAN GETTING OUT OF PRISON
I THOUGHT ABOUT MY MOTHER MY BIGGEST
MY REQUEST IS THAT WE REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE MODELS THAT ARE BEING CREATED THE MODELS THAT SAY IT'S OK FOR ME TO SHOW UP TO A SPEAKING
MOST OF SOCIETY IS MISSING THE BENEFIT THAT THE MEN COMING HOME AND MANY OF THE MEN IN THIS ROOM HAVE TO OFFER SOCIETY
I KNEW THAT I COULDN'T DO IT ALONE AND IN FACT I WAS TIRED OF BEING ALONE SO I STARTED TO REACH OUT TO THE ONLY COMMUNITY I KNEW
DON'T GIVE A DAMN IF YOU'VE GOT A GUN OR NOT SOMEBODY STOLE MY PHONE
TWO TYPES OF LIFE SENTENCES
ONE IS LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE AND THE OTHER ONE IS LIFE WITH
I WAS SENTENCED TO 17 YEARS TO LIFE
I EVENTUALLY DID 18 YEARS AND AFTER APPEARING BEFORE THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS FIVE TIMES I WAS RELEASED
WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE THE ENTREPRENEUR SKILLS THAT MEN HAVE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY AND TRANSFER THAT INTO A CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT AND BE OUR OWN BOSSES
THAT'S BECAUSE WANTING TO REACH OUT AND CONNECT AND TOUCH THE WORLD AROUND YOU AND MAKE A
COULD I DO THAT OR SOMETHING LIKE IT AND WHEN I STARTED ASKING THAT QUESTION AND POKING AROUND A LITTLE BIT I GOT
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOUTH ARE ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES TO INTRODUCE THESE IDEAS
AND THERE'S A RESONANCE THERE WITH CERTAIN LIFE PATTERNS AND JUST SORT OF INHERITED SKILLS AND SENSITIVITIES
THERE'S BIG APPLICATION FOR THIS AT THAT LEVEL AS WELL THE FIRST CATEGORY OF THE 5 THAT ARE MISSING IS BUSINESS AND THIS
TEACH IT TO PEOPLE AND SEE GREAT RESULTS SO I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU {NS} ALL
AND THIS THING IT STARTS OFF AS SORT OF A LITTLE INTRODUCTION TO SOME
TO HEAR WHAT THEY SAID TODAY AND I GUARANTEE YOU BY THINKING ABOUT THEM YOU CAN MOVE THEIR BALL DOWN THE FIELD AND HELP THEM AND THAT'S WHAT'S FUN BECAUSE YOU START TO BECOME A QUANTUM LEAP MAGICIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIS THESE ARE 7 PRETTY UNDERSTANDABLE CATEGORIES
AND WIRE STUFF UP AND HAVE IT EXPLODE AND THEN LEAVE IT FOR A WEEK BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT AND COME BACK TO IT
AN ENERGY STATE THAT IS LOWER TO AN ENERGY STATE THAT'S HIGHER I KIND OF LIKE THAT AS AN ANALOGUE AND
AREA THAT MEANS NOT JUST ARE WE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE OUR NEW WORLD
APPS THAT SELL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF MERCHANDISE A DAY
IT MEANS WHAT NEW WORLD ARE WE GOING TO CREATE STACY HAD THAT GREAT TALK THIS MORNING REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE'S JUST SAID WHEN YOU GOT SO MANY DAYS LEFT WHAT'S THE
AND YOU'VE LEARNED AND YOU'VE ABSORBED AND YOU'VE RETAINED SORT OF THINGS THAT YOU WERE TESTED ON BUT KNOWING WHAT'S OUT IN THE
THAT VALUES AND ETHICS AREN'T LIMITING
IS ABOUT THAT WHAT WILL YOU DO AND WHAT WON'T YOU DO WITH HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT YOUR PARTICULAR SKILL AND THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT
IF YOU HAVE A TINY HOUSE THAT CREATES A PROBLEM
WE CAN HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF LAND SO PEOPLE HAVE A HOUSE THAT HAS A GARAGE WELL THE GARAGE IS A GREAT PLACE TO MAKE A HUGE MESS AND DRILL
AND I WATCHED F18 ACCELERATE STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AND I'D FIDDLE AROUND PROGRAMMING SECOND HAND SUPERCOMPUTERS BECAUSE SANDIA LABS WOULD CAST ONE ASIDE AND GET THE NEW
CORE QUALITIES THAT YOU CAN LOOK FOR AND
THIS STUFF TO SOME PEOPLE IT'S SORT OF A WORLD YOU DON'T GO TO BUT KIDS OF COURSE GET ALL THIS THEY GET FAIRY GODMOTHERS AND THEY GET DEMONS AND
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CAPITAL STRUCTURE YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ACCOUNTING TAX LAW TO SOME PEOPLE IN THIS
OF WHATEVER IS THAT YOU ARE DOING AND SOME PEOPLE
THE COOL THING IS THAT WE ARE IN NEW MEXICO I AM HERE FOR A REASON AND I SUSPECT THAT A LOT OF YOU MIGHT BE HERE FOR THE SAME REASON WE HAVE 2
GROUNDED WITH A LARGER CONCEPT OF WHAT THE DIVINE IS THEN YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE RISK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY
THE QUESTION IS OKAY WE CAN ESTABLISH THAT THERE ARE THESE SORT OF TWO
DOESN'T WHAT WOULD I LEARN FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S BRILLIANT IN ONE WAY WHAT THINGS COMBINE TO END UP AS SOMETHING THAT IS A NEW REAL THING THAT IS MAGIC
WE'RE APPLYING THIS STUFF IN WAYS THAT WE WANT TO USE FOR EDUCATION WE'RE USING IT
NEW MEXICO CULTURALIST THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S IN THE ART SCENE UP IN SANTA FE
AND STYLE AND THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU KNOW FRANKLY IN THE NEW MEXICO CONTEXT
GREAT WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A PROGRAM WITH HARVARD THAT HAS A SPECIAL CONCENTRATION IN INNOVATION
BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS YOU GET OUT OF
I WAS GOING TO GO OUT INTO THE WOLRD AND TRY TO MAKE COOL STUFF AND ALL THE WHILE I KEPT BUILDING A SORT OF KNOWLEDGEBASE OF
IF IT MIGHT NOT WORK AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING MORE SO
THAT LETS YOU SCRATCH AROUND AND TRY STUFF AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE YOU KNOW THERE'S A
MARSHMALLOW COMPETITION OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS THE KEY RIGHT
KIND OF SEE THAT PERSON WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND THIS GETS KIND OF SCARY BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET DEEPER INTO THIS YOU KIND OF CAN DO
SKETCH AND TURNING IT INTO MOLECULES OF A WORKING TEST OF SOMETHING
ABOUT OH LET'S GO LIVE IN A LOFT BE CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU NEED A MESSY PLACE SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE FIND ONE
WE CAN LEAVE TO THE WORLD THAT IS ALSO WORTHY OF HANGING IN THE LOUVRE
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHATEVER THEY DO NEEDS TO BE SUSTAINABLE THEY CAN'T RUN OUT OF
LIKE OH THAT MEANS I CAN'T DO CERTAIN THINGS SEE WALT DISNEY LOOKED AT VALUES AND HE SAID WELL THAT'S LIBERATING LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR KIDS THAT WE FEEL GOOD
WHO JUST WERE VERY VERY GOOD AT THIS AND IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO KNOW HOW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF CRYOGENIC VALVES THERE ARE IN THE WORLD BUT IT TURNS OUT
EVER FELT LIKE YOU JUST WANT TO DESIGN SOMETHING REALLY COOL OR IF YOU'VE EVER JUST FELT LIKE YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOUR SITUATION JUST A LITTLE BIT
JAPAN THEY DON'T HAVE GARAGES
AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT IDEATION IT'S ALSO ABOUT JUST BEING A KID AGAIN AND STARTING TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS THAT'S WHAT TEDX IS SO GREAT FOR IT'S WHY WE DO A LOT OF WORK
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS AND ASK THEM SOME
YOU GET A SENSE FOR THE ART SIDE AND THE SCIENCE SIDE I AM GOING TO THIS IN DETAIL IN A
TO MAKE A STRONGER STRUCTURE THIS IS A SKILL THAT IS VERY MUCH IN NEED IN OUR CULTURE AND WE'RE LOSING IT BECAUSE IN SCHOOLS SHOP CLASS ART
YOU ACTUALLY TOUCH PHYSICAL STUFF ARE BECOMING LESS AND LESS IN FASHION
THING I ALSO WILL JUST THROW OUT THAT IN EDUCATION THIS IS GOING AWAY WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS IT'S BECOME A TABOO SUBJECT CERTAINLY IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DO AS MUCH THE NEXT AREA IS KIND OF FUNKY THIS IS COTS
CHANGES RADICAL CHANGES NEW REALITIES AND
I GO INTO THEM THIS IS NOT SORT OF MATHEMATICAL IVORY
AS WE BECOME ADULTS WE DON'T FORGET THOSE THINGS WE JUST SORT OF SOMETIMES PRETEND THEY AREN'T THERE THE NEXT
THERE WHO KNEW THAT AND IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO THIS WITH THE INTERNET BECAUSE I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE THERE WAS AN INTERNET AND IT WAS REALLY HARD BECAUSE YOU HAD TO GO TO TRADE SHOWS AND YOU HAD TO REALLY SORT OF NETWORK TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THE NEXT SONY HD CAMERA GOING TO
I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT IN YOUR LIFE WHERE IS YOUR WORKBENCH WHERE IS YOUR
BECAUSE PRODUCT DESIGN AND THE SORT OF REDUCTION TO A THING THAT PEOPLE CAN USE IS
WELL THAT'S NOT A WHITE COLLAR KIND OF THING TO DO SO WE KIND OF DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON IT THIS IS A PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT
THE NEXT ONE I'M CALLING DESIGN
WORLD INNOVATION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE SO
AND IT'S KIND OF A PLAY ON WORDS BECAUSE QUANTUM LEAP IS THE IDEA OF A NEW WORLD RIGHT
AND THAT'S WHY I AM EXCITED TO BE HERE BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF WHAT TED IS ABOUT AND I FEEL VERY AT HOME WITH THE CONCEPTS AND THE IDEAS
AND MAKE YOUR THING WORK BETTER AND THAT MEANS PRODUCTS BUT IT ALSO MEANS WHO COULD YOU GO TALK TO WHO COULD YOU
THERE'S A GENERAL ASSUMPTION THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES CAUSE EXTREME EMOTIONS AND THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WOMEN ARE AFFECTED BY THIS WELL I AM HERE TO TELL YOU
OTHER RESEARCHERS SAID THAT SYMPTOMS WERE ONLY MEANINGFUL IF THEY WERE HIGHLY DISTURBING TO YOU BUT OTHERS SAID MINOR SYMPTOMS WERE JUST AS IMPORTANT
FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STANDARDIZATION IN THE DEFINITION OF PMS WHEN PSYCHOLOGISTS TRIED TO REPORT PREVALENCE RATES THEIR ESTIMATES RANGED FROM FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN TO 97 PERCENT OF WOMEN
SO AT THE SAME TIME ALMOST NO ONE AND ALMOST EVERYONE HAD PMS
OVERALL THE WEAKNESSES IN THE METHODS
IS WHY HASN'T THIS INFORMATION TRICKLED DOWN TO THE PUBLIC WHY DO THESE MYTHS PERSIST
AND THAT SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY SHOULD NOW BE DOCUMENTED BY KEEPING A DAILY LOG FOR AT LEAST TWO CYCLES IN A ROW
AND FINALLY THE DSM REQUIRED THAT THE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE SHOULD BE MORE THAN SIMPLY AN EXACERBATION OF AN ALREADY EXISTING DISORDER
SO SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT
WE NOW HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS AND A HIGH IMPACT ON FUNCTIONING THAT'S REQUIRED
AND THE REPORTING AND TIMING OF SYMPTOMS HAVE BOTH BECOME VERY SPECIFIC
EMOTIONS UNDER THE RUG OF PMS
KEEPS WOMEN FROM UNDERSTANDING THE SOURCE OF THEIR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS BUT IT ALSO TAKES AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ANY ACTION TO CHANGE THEM
SO THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT PMS IS THAT WHILE SOME WOMEN GET SOME SYMPTOMS BECAUSE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE THE GREAT MAJORITY DON'T GET A MENTAL DISORDER
THEY GO TO WORK OR SCHOOL TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND FUNCTION AT NORMAL LEVEL
WE KNOW THE EMOTIONS AND MOODS OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE MORE SIMILAR THAN DIFFERENT
SO LET'S WALK AWAY FROM THE TIRED OLD PMS MYTH
OF WOMEN AS WITCHES
AND EMBRACE THE REALITY
OF HIGH EMOTIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL FUNCTIONING THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WOMEN LIVE EVERY DAY
COME UP WITH A DISORDER THAT'S SO VAGUELY DEFINED THE LABEL EVENTUALLY BECOMES MEANINGLESS WITH A LIST OF SYMPTOMS THIS LONG AND WIDE
WELL CERTAINLY THE ONSLAUGHT OF MESSAGES THAT WOMEN RECEIVE FROM BOOKS TV MOVIES THE INTERNET THAT EVERYONE GETS PMS GO A LONG WAY IN CONVINCING THEM IT MUST BE TRUE
RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THE MORE A WOMAN BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE GETS PMS THE MORE LIKELY SHE IS TO ERRONEOUSLY REPORT THAT SHE HAS IT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN BY ERRONEOUSLY
YOU MIGHT ASK
BEEN THE CASE WITH THESE TREATMENTS AND FDA REGULATIONS SAY THAT FOR DRUG TO BE DEEMED EFFECTIVE A LARGE PORTION OF THE TARGET POPULATION SHOULD SEE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
SO WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT AT ALL WITH THESE SO CALLED TREATMENTS
HOWEVER
THE FINANCIAL GAIN OF PERPETUATING THE MYTH THAT PMS IS A COMMON MENTAL DISORDER AND IS TREATABLE
IS QUITE SUBSTANTIAL
WHEN WOMEN ARE PRESCRIBED DRUGS LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR HORMONES MEDICAL PROTOCOL REQUIRES THAT THEY HAVE PHYSICIAN FOLLOW UP EVERY THREE MONTHS THAT'S A LOT OF DOCTOR VISITS
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES REAP UNTOLD PROFITS WHEN WOMEN ARE CONVINCED THEY SHOULD TAKE A PRESCRIBED MEDICATION FOR ALL OF THEIR CHILD BEARING LIVES
OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS LIKE MIDOL EVEN CLAIM TO TREAT PMS SYMPTOMS LIKE TENSION AND IRRITABILITY
EVEN THOUGH THEY ONLY CONTAIN A DIARRHETIC A PAIN RELIEVER AND
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR EFFECT CHANGE IS SEVERELY LIMITED
SO WHO ELSE BENEFITS FROM THE MYTH OF PMS
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT TREATING PMS HAS BECOME A PROFITABLE THRIVING INDUSTRY
AMAZON COM CURRENTLY OFFERS OVER 1900 BOOKS ON PMS TREATMENT
A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH WILL BRING UP A CORNUCOPIA
OF CLINICS WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS
REPUTABLE INTERNET SOURCES OF MEDICAL INFORMATION LIKE WEBMD OR THE MAYO CLINIC LIST PMS AS A KNOWN DISORDER IT'S NOT A KNOWN DISORDER BUT THEY LIST IT
AND THEY ALSO LIST THE MEDICATIONS THAT PHYSICIANS HAVE PRESCRIBED TO TREAT IT LIKE ANTI DEPRESSANTS OR HORMONES
DEFINITION OF A GOOD WOMAN IS ONE WHO IS HAPPY LOVING CARING FOR OTHERS AND TAKING GREAT SATISFACTION FROM THAT ROLE WELL PMS HAS BECOME A PERMISSION SLIP TO BE ANGRY
AND YOU WILL BE A HUMAN BEING AGAIN
IN 2013 MIDOL TOOK IN 48 MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES REVENUE
SO WHILE PERPETUATING THE MYTH OF PMS HAS BEEN LUCRATIVE FOR SOME
IT COMES WITH SOME SERIOUS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR WOMEN
FIRST IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE MEDICALIZATION OF WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
THE MEDICAL FIELD HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CONCEPTUALIZING WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES AS ILLNESSES THAT REQUIRE TREATMENT
AND THIS HAS COME AT MANY COSTS INCLUDING EXCESSIVE CESAREAN DELIVERIES HYSTERECTOMIES
AND PRESCRIBED HORMONE TREATMENTS THAT HAVE HARMED RATHER THAN ENHANCED WOMEN'S HEALTH
FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THEY REDEFINED
STUDIES ALSO EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON WHITE MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN WHICH MAKES IT PROBLEMATIC TO APPLY STUDY FINDINGS TO ALL WOMEN
WE KNOW THERE'S A STRONG CULTURAL COMPONENT TO THE BELIEF IN PMS BECAUSE IT'S NEARLY UNHEARD OF OUTSIDE OF WESTERN NATIONS
THIRD MANY STUDIES FAILED TO USE CONTROL GROUPS
IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE PMS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE THEM TO WOMEN WHO DON'T HAVE PMS
AND FINALLY MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUESTIONNAIRES WERE USED TO DIAGNOSE PMS FOCUSING ON DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS SYMPTOM DURATION AND SEVERITY
TO DO RELIABLE RESEARCH ON ANY CONDITION
SCIENTISTS MUST AGREE ON THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE UP THAT CONDITION SO THEY'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING
AND WITH PMS THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE
HOWEVER IN 1994
THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS KNOWN AS THE DSM THANKFULLY IT'S
BEFORE THEY GET THEIR PERIOD THAT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE THROWS THEM ONTO AN INEVITABLE HORMONAL ROLLER COASTER OF IRRATIONALITY AND
BE IRRITATED WITHOUT LOSING THE TITLE OF GOOD WOMAN
WE KNOW THAT THE VARIABLES IN A WOMAN'S ENVIRONMENT ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE HER TO BE ANGRY THAN HER HORMONES BUT WHEN SHE ATTRIBUTES ANGER TO HORMONES SHE'S ABSOLVED OF RESPONSIBILITY OR CRITICISM OH THAT'S NOT WHO SHE IS IT'S OUT OF HER CONTROL
AND WHILE THIS CAN BE A USEFUL TOOL
IT SERVES TO INVALIDATE WOMEN'S EMOTIONS
FROM ALL THESE ARTICLES YOU WOULD THINK THERE MUST BE A MOUNTAIN OF RESEARCH VERIFYING THE WIDESPREAD NATURE OF PMS
HOWEVER AFTER FIVE DECADES OF RESEARCH
THERE'S NO STRONG CONSENSUS ON THE DEFINITION THE CAUSE THE TREATMENT OR EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF PMS
AS MOST COMMONLY DEFINED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS PMS INVOLVES NEGATIVE BEHAVIORAL COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS FROM THE TIME OF
SOMEONE WHO HAS QUALITIES LIKE RATIONALITY STEADINESS COMPETENCE COME TO MIND
AND IN OUR CULTURE THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE A MAN THAN A WOMAN
AND THE PMS MYTH CONTRIBUTES TO THAT
PSYCHOLOGISTS KNOW THAT THE MOODS OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE MORE SIMILAR THAN DIFFERENT
ONE STUDY FOLLOWED MEN AND WOMEN FOR FOUR TO SIX MONTHS
AND FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF MOOD SWINGS THEY EXPERIENCED AND THE SEVERITY OF THOSE MOOD SWINGS WERE NO DIFFERENT
NOW FAR BE IT FROM ME TO ARGUE WITH THE MAGICAL POWERS OF CAFFEINE BUT I DON'T THINK REDUCING TENSION IS ONE OF THEM
HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN THE WORKFORCE BUT STILL THERE'S A MINUSCULE NUMBER OF WOMEN AT THE HIGHEST ECHELONS OF FIELDS LIKE GOVERNMENT OR BUSINESS AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHO MAKES FOR A GOOD CEO OR
COULD COME FROM THE FIRST SLIDE OR FROM THOSE ON THE SECOND SLIDE INCLUDING SYMPTOMS LIKE FEELING OUT OF CONTROL AND CHANGES IN SLEEP OR
NEWS ABOUT PMS BUT FIRST LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW FIRMLY THE IDEA OF PMS IS
BUT THAT
JOY
HAS CHANGED FOR ME IN THESE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS
RESULTS DOMINATE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS DOMINATE US THE STUDENTS THE BRIGHT STARS OF OUR SCHOOLS THE
SET OUR MINDS FREE GIVE TEACHERS THE CHANCE TO GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO DISCOVER MY TALENTS
WHEN MY FUTURE DAUGHTER TURNS FOUR YEARS OLD AND ALSO MAKES HER FIRST STEPS INTO HER
WHEN WE GET THE CHANCE FOR INNOVATION NOT MEMORIZATION JAMES BEATTIE A
WORKING OVERTIME JUST TO AVOID FAILING TRYING SO HARD TO GET GOOD GRADES JUST TO AVOID BEING LABELLED AS WORTHLESS JUST TO AVOID BEING IDENTIFIED
SHE DESERVES REAL EDUCATION
NO BEGS FOR NUMBERS THAT MAKE PEOPLE WONDER IF THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH NOW I'M BEGGING FOR ORIGINALITY OUR
THE STUDENTS THE FREEDOM TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER TO GROW WITH EACH OTHER AND TOGETHER TO HAVE A
I WAS TWO YEARS OLD WHEN I AS A LITTLE AFRICAN GIRL WITH A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GOOD FUTURE
DOORS WERE OPENED FOR ME AND I CAME TO THE NETHERLANDS
I WAS FOUR WHEN I ACTUALLY TOOK STEPS TO MAKE SOMETHING GREAT OUT OF MY LIFE
SCHOOL
I'VE HAD SOME AMAZING EXPERIENCES WITH AMAZING TEACHERS WHO OPENED MY EYES TO LEARNING WITH
DAYS A WEEK 200 DAYS A YEAR A MIND
OUR CREATIVITY NOT OUR GRADES DETERMINES OUR SUCCESS
THE STUDENTS WHO INSTEAD OF EMBRACING THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE TAUGHT ONLY TRY TO SURVIVE MY MIND
PERSIAN BUT I WAS BORN IN SWITZERLAND MOVED TO SLOVAKIA AND NOW I'M CURRENTLY LIVING IN ITALY SO TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I SIMPLY CONSIDER MYSELF A WORLD
MANY PROBLEMS I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THESE PROBLEMS WERE NOT CAUSED BY YOUTH THEY WERE RATHER CAUSED BY THE ACTION OR SHOULD I SAY
THE HARVEST DAY SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENED THE CITY WORKERS HAD MOWED DOWN OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY GARDEN BY ACCIDENT ALONG WITH LIKE THE REST OF THE LAND I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY COULD DO THAT
TO GET TO THESE SOLUTIONS US YOUTH HAVE TO SOLVE THESE
SO WHY WERE ALL THESE CONFERENCES HELD FOR YOUTH
WHAT HAD STARTED AS A SMALL
AMAZING AND IT CAN BE USED FOR SUCH GOOD THINGS BUT YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE BECAUSE IT CAN
SOLVE THE WORLD'S CHALLENGES
SO TO CONCLUDE I WOULD LIKE TO REVISIT THE QUESTION IN THE TITLE
WHO'S WRITING OUR FUTURE
I THINK BY NOW WE CAN ALL AGREE AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWER
THAT THE FUTURE ITS SHAPE ITS QUALITY ITS POTENTIALS AND PROMISES LIE IN THE POWER OF YOUTH
AND TODAY'S YOUTH
I WOULD LIKE TO SEND YOU A MESSAGE PLEASE YOUTH OF TODAY AND FUTURE YOUTH
LIKE CHILDREN THAT ARE GOING TO BECOME YOUTH PLEASE REMEMBER VALUE THE ENERGY THAT RESTS INSIDE OF YOU
BECAUSE
WAS
A GREAT EXPERIENCE AN EXAMPLE OF SHOWING YOU HOW MUCH YOUTH AND WE CAN ACHIEVE AS LONG AS WE KEEP BELIEVING AND AS LONG AS OUR POWER AND ENERGY IS
PUT INTO GOOD USE
SO AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT SOCIETY NEEDS TO REEVALUATE ITS PERCEPTION OF YOUTH
SOCIETY CONSIDERS THE YOUTH AS MATERIALISTIC LAZY SOLELY FUN SEEKING AND IRRESPONSIBLE AND YES WE CAN BE THAT SOMETIMES BUT THAT'S BECAUSE SOCIETY STRESSES AND ENCOURAGES THIS THROUGH THE FILM INDUSTRY MUSIC INDUSTRY AND THE MEDIA AT LARGE WE SEE THE STEREOTYPICAL IMAGE OF THE YOUTH
WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THAT IMAGE WE NEED TO
STOP THESE PROBLEMS FROM GROWING FURTHER AND SECOND TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO
THE OLDER GENERATIONS AND YET IRONICALLY IT IS US YOUTH THAT HAVE TO TAKE THE
I'M 15 AND WHERE AM I FROM GOOD QUESTION I'M
CHANGE OUR ESTIMATION OF YOUTH BECAUSE THE YOUTH ARE THE GLOBAL THINKERS OF OUR FUTURE AND
BY THE END OF THE CONFERENCE I COULD VISUALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF THE
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE NEXT TIME WHEN YOU SEE A YOUTH PLEASE LOOK AGAIN BUT WITH DIFFERENT EYES BECAUSE THAT YOUTH STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU IS POTENTIALLY THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD THANK YOU
I WAS ONLY ONE OUT OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED YOUTH AT THAT EVENT
AND THAT I ONLY ATTENDED ONE CONFERENCE OUT OF THE 114 YOUTH CONFERENCES
SOME OF THESE CONFERENCES WERE HELD IN PLACES I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AS ANTANANARIVO OR KADUGANNAWA I'M NOT SURE IF I'M
THE ARTS WERE REALLY STRESSED AND HOW THEY WERE INTEGRATED IN PRACTICALLY EVERY ACTIVITY WE DID I
WELL I WANT OUR ORGANIZATIONS TO REMAIN HUMAN IN FACT I WANT THEM TO BECOME BEAUTIFUL
ACTIONS LIKE ULUKAYA'S ARE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE THEY CATCH US OFF GUARD THEY CREATE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY
ALL BEEN UGLY ONCE WE WERE A WEIRD LOOKING BABY A NEW KID ON THE BLOCK A FOREIGNER AND WE WILL BE UGLY AGAIN WHEN WE DON'T BELONG
NOT THE GREAT GESTURE OR THE LOFTY PROMISE IT'S SMALL MOMENTS OF ATTACHMENT IN OTHER WORDS INTIMACY
ARE RELATIONSHIPS OTHER THAN A STRING OF MICROINTERACTIONS THERE HUNDREDS OF THESE EVERY DAY IN OUR ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISTINGUISH A GOOD LIFE FROM A BEAUTIFUL ONE
THE MARRIAGE RESEARCHER JOHN GOTTMAN SAYS THAT THE SECRET OF A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP
UGLY ROOM SERVED AS A MIX OF MIRROR EXHIBITION AND OPERATING ROOM A BIOPSY ON THE LIVING FLESH TO CUT OUT ALL THE BUREAUCRACY
IT A PR STUNT OTHERS A GENUINE ACT OF GIVING BACK BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS REMARKABLE ABOUT
CONNECTEDNESS INTIMACY IS THE OPPOSITE OF LONELINESS SO HOW DO WE DESIGN FOR ORGANIZATIONAL INTIMACY
HAD DESIGNED THIS EXPERIENCE WHY IT WORKED SHE SIMPLY SAID NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF A RIDICULOUS WIG {LG}
THEY REMAIN INCOMPLETE WHICH IS THE FOURTH AND THE LAST OF THE PRINCIPLES
LEVELS AND REGIONS FOR A THREE DAY STRATEGY RETREAT AND IT ASKED EVERYBODY TO WEAR COSTUMES FOR THE ENTIRE
THERE THEY OPENLY DISCUSSED THEIR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES OF GENDER EQUALITY
THAT'S NOT EASY IN OUR EVERYDAY WORK LIVES BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ORGANIZATIONS IS OFTEN LIKE THAT OF A MARRIED COUPLE THAT HAS GROWN APART
I DIDN'T KNOW BACK THEN
THAT OUR DECISION MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE END THAT THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS WOULD NEVER BECOME ONE
AND SURE ENOUGH THE MERGER EVENTUALLY FAILED
NOW WAS IT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ANY ORANGE BALLOONS
NO OF COURSE NOT
EVEN AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THEIR OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN THEY ARE MOVEMENTS THEY ARE ALWAYS IMPERFECT NEVER FULLY ORGANIZED SO THEY AVOID EVER BECOMING BANAL THEY HAVE SOMETHING BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY REMAIN MYSTERIOUS WE CAN'T TAKE OUR EYES OFF THEM
AND TO UNIFY THESE IMMENSELY DIFFERENT CULTURES WE WERE GOING TO LAUNCH A THIRD NEW BRAND AND THE NEW BRAND COLOR WAS GOING TO BE ORANGE
ARE MUCH NEEDED BECAUSE THINGS TEND TO GET UGLY WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE MEANING ONE TRUTH ONLY ANSWERS AND NO QUESTIONS BEAUTIFUL ORGANIZATIONS KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS
MACHINES ARE MORE EFFICIENT HUMANS ARE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO MANAGE
AND HOW FITTING THAT PARIS THE CITY OF IDEALS THE CITY OF BEAUTY WAS IT'S STAGE IT REMINDS US THAT LIKE GREAT CITIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ORGANIZATIONS ARE IDEAS WORTH FIGHTING FOR
IT ALSO BROKE DOWN INVISIBLE BARRIERS AND CREATED A LASTING BOND AMONGST THEMSELVES NOT A SINGLE TEAM MEMBER QUIT IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
USE OUR ORGANIZATIONS TO CREATE THAT FEELING FOR OTHERS BEAUTY CAN SAVE THE WORLD WHEN WE EMBRACE THESE PRINCIPLES AND DESIGN FOR THEM
IN THE FACE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING WE NEED A NEW RADICAL HUMANISM WE MUST ACQUIRE AND PROMOTE A NEW AESTHETIC AND SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T
WE MIGHT END UP FEELING LIKE ALIENS
BEAR WITH ME AS I AM PROPOSING FOUR ADMITTEDLY VERY SUBJECTIVE PRINCIPLES THAT YOU CAN USE TO BUILD A BEAUTIFUL ORGANIZATION
UGLY CUTS CLEAN TO THE BONE AS THE WRITER DOROTHY PARKER ONCE PUT IT TO BE AUTHENTIC IS TO BE UGLY
FOR THE CEO AND THE INTERN WIGS ALLOW US TO USE THE DISGUISE OF THE FALSE TO SHOW SOMETHING TRUE ABOUT OURSELVES
HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS AND THESE ARE ALSO THE QUALITIES OF WHAT WE CALL HOME
OF CONTROVERSIES AND CONTRADICTIONS BUT WHETHER YOU AGREED WITH THE MOVEMENT'S GOALS OR NOT EVERY GATHERING WAS A BEAUTIFUL LESSON IN RAW HUMANITY
THAT WHEN SOMEONE GETS FIRED THEY HAVE GRADUATED {LG} THAT KIND OF BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE ONLY GOES SKIN DEEP
LEADING WITH BEAUTY MEANS RISING ABOVE WHAT IS MERELY NECESSARY SO DO NOT KILL YOUR ORANGE BALLOONS
BECAUSE AS MACHINES TAKE OUR JOBS AND DO THEM MORE EFFICIENTLY SOON THE ONLY WORK LEFT FOR US HUMANS WILL BE THE KIND OF WORK THAT MUST BE DONE BEAUTIFULLY RATHER THAN EFFICIENTLY
THE UNNECESSARY THE INTIMATE THE INCOMPLETE AND DEFINITELY NOT FOR THE UGLY THANK YOU
