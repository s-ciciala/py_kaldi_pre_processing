AGivotqSrd0/00018_2,THAT YOU CAN MOVE AWAY FROM THAT,6.200,8.865
AGivotqSrd0/00018_3,AND OFTEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANS FOLKS MOVING AWAY FROM THAT UNCHOSEN STARTING POINT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRANSITION,8.865,16.105
AGivotqSrd0/00018_4,AND THE TERM TRANSITION CAN MEAN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S NO ONE WAY TO TRANSITION AND THERE'S NO ONE RIGHT WAY TO BE TRANS,16.105,-1.000

9jk2NZpSLWo/00005_2,SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE USE OF THE DATA THAT WE TRANSFORM THE DATA INTO VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE,13.255,19.330
9jk2NZpSLWo/00005_3,LET ME JUST ILLUSTRATE WHAT REALLY BIG DATA IS ABOUT,19.330,22.570
9jk2NZpSLWo/00005_4,WE HAVE NOW THE SQUARE KILOMETRE ARRAY,22.570,26.430

I9weytKalQQ/00002_0,AFTER READING ALL THE SCHOLARLY WORK,0.000,2.165
I9weytKalQQ/00002_1,I WONDERED WHY NOBODY HAD USED BIO SENSORS TO DEVELOP A PREGNANCY LIKE URINE TEST FOR DIAGNOSING DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER,2.165,10.015
I9weytKalQQ/00002_2,CURIOUS ABOUT THIS LARGE GAP IN RESEARCH,10.015,12.970
I9weytKalQQ/00002_3,I CONTACTED FACULTY AT LOCAL COLLEGES ABOUT HOW I COULD HELP EXPLORE THIS RESEARCH PROBLEM,12.970,18.360
I9weytKalQQ/00002_4,I SOON REALIZED THAT MOST LABS IN MY HOMETOWN OF MONTGOMERY ALABAMA,18.360,23.385
I9weytKalQQ/00002_5,DID NOT HAVE SPOTS FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS EVEN IF THEY DID THEY WOULDN'T LET A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT RESEARCH THAT FREELY,23.385,-1.000

I9weytKalQQ/00007_2,DETERMINATION,4.610,6.010
I9weytKalQQ/00007_3,I STARTED TO BELIEVE THAT RADICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS EMAILING RESEARCHERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES COULD HAVE A POSITIVE RESULT THAT THE ORDINARY PERSON WOULD EASILY OVERLOOK,6.010,17.710
I9weytKalQQ/00007_4,BECAUSE MY PARENTS DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL TWO WEEKS AFTER I SENT THE EMAILS,17.710,-1.000
I9weytKalQQ/00001_0,I LEARNED MANY BASIC LAB TECHNIQUES SUCH AS COUNTING CELLS AND HANDLING MICROPIPETTES,0.000,8.730

DzWjaWFLjgg/00010_35,AFTER FEW MONTHS OF SETTLING THEM,147.760,151.195
DzWjaWFLjgg/00010_36,TRYING TO HEAL THEIR WOUNDS BOTH PSYCHOLOGICALLY MENTALLY PHYSICALLY,151.195,156.735
DzWjaWFLjgg/00010_37,THEY WOULD TRY TO GET THESE GIRLS TO GO TO COURT TO STAND AS WITNESSES,156.735,162.450
DzWjaWFLjgg/00010_38,AND NONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE THE COURAGE BECAUSE OF ALL THE SOCIAL ISSUES THEY WERE THREATENED BY THE MAFIA,162.450,168.995

DzWjaWFLjgg/00005_8,WE HAVE THE CONCEPT OF DHARMA,26.645,29.115
DzWjaWFLjgg/00005_9,SO STORIES HAVE CONTINUOUSLY DONE THIS,29.115,32.525
DzWjaWFLjgg/00005_10,THEY HAVE USED IMAGERY,32.525,34.720
DzWjaWFLjgg/00005_11,TO GET IDEAS ACROSS,34.720,37.420
DzWjaWFLjgg/00005_12,THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CINEMA AND MOST OF THE EARLIER FORMS OF STORYTELLING IS VERY SIMPLE,37.420,-1.000

DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_6,AND,22.710,23.755
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_7,THAT'S HOW THE JOURNEY OF LASKHMI STARTED,23.755,26.325
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_8,NOW WITH LAKSHMI,26.325,28.255
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_9,MY INTENTION BOTH AS A PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR,28.255,33.570
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_10,IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS AT THE BOX OFFICE I WANT THIS FILM TO TRAVEL,33.570,38.765
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_11,SO WHAT I HAVE DONE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS FILM,38.765,42.775
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_12,IS,42.775,43.805
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_13,WAY BEFORE THE RELEASE WE STARTED SHOWING THE FILM AROUND COLLEGE CAMPUSES,43.805,48.740
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_14,AND,48.740,49.800
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_15,IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE IN MY LIFE,49.800,53.805
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_16,BECAUSE THE RESPONSES THAT WE GOT THE KIND OF SPREAD OF AWARENESS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE REASON THAT I ATTACKED THE COLLEGES WAS VERY,53.805,64.660
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_17,SIMPLE YOU GUYS ARE LITERALLY THE LAST STAGE BEFORE,64.660,70.725

DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_24,IN ADDITION WE STARTED TALKING TO NGOS TO TRY AND SCREEN,89.210,93.680
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_25,THIS,93.680,94.595
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_26,INITIALLY I WAS LITTLE HESITANT BECAUSE I FELT THAT GIRLS WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THEIR OWN HORROR DEPICTED ON THE SCREEN SO WAS LITTLE HESITANT BUT THE RESPONSE THAT I'VE GOTTEN FROM LOT OF THE NGOS IS THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY INSPIRE MANY MORE LAKSHMIS,94.595,111.900
DzWjaWFLjgg/00012_27,SO THIS NEEDS TO BE SHOWN,111.900,113.795

BT2XlI8oeh0/00006_12,THEY NEEDED ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AS A REPORTER AND THE ONLY EXPERIENCE I REALLY HAD WAS ANSWERING PHONES AND SENDING FAXES THAT'S ALL I REALLY KNEW HOW TO DO,59.015,68.940
BT2XlI8oeh0/00006_13,AND SO THEY SAID NO REPEATEDLY TO ME AND ON TOP OF THAT I HAD A BRITISH ACCENT AND IN AMERICA IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE LOCAL NEWS BUSINESS,68.940,77.150

BT2XlI8oeh0/00011_5,AND I NEEDED TO BE READY,26.830,-1.000
BT2XlI8oeh0/00010_0,SO THIS HAD A PRETTY DEEP IMPACT ON ME BECAUSE I'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF CEOS FOR CNN AND I'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF FOUNDERS FOR TECH START UPS SOME OF WHOM HAVE MADE MILLIONS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS USUALLY WHAT THEY SAY IS IF YOU WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED TO NETWORK HAVE BRAND STUDY YOUR COMPETITION,0.000,16.310
BT2XlI8oeh0/00010_1,AND SHE HAD SOME PRACTICAL ADVICE AS WELL,16.310,18.875
BT2XlI8oeh0/00010_2,BUT SUDDENLY THE MORAL OF HER STORY WAS THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE THE MORE YOU RECEIVE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE TRIED IT I'VE TESTED IT AND I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE IN GIVING JUST TO RECEIVE,18.875,29.710
BT2XlI8oeh0/00010_3,BUT SHE IS RIGHT THE MORE YOU GIVE,29.710,32.645

BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_2,MERGES AND ACQUISITIONS TEACHING MYSELF AND IN FACT THE LIBRARIANS ON 33RD WITH MADISON IN NEW YORK GOT TO KNOW ME VERY WELL BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES I'D BE THE LAST PERSON TO LEAVE,8.295,18.435
BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_3,SO AFTER DOING THAT FOR FEW YEARS EVENTUALLY BY PURE CHANCE I HAPPENED TO MEET AN EXECUTIVE AT CNN AND I ASKED HIM WHICH DEPARTMENT HE WORKED IN,18.435,27.490
BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_4,HE SAID HE RAN THE BUSINESS NEWS UNIT AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A REPORTER,27.490,31.705
BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_5,SO WHEN I MET HIM HE GAVE ME ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO COME IN FOR SCREEN TEST,31.705,37.455
BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_6,AND ALSO FOR A FINANCIAL NEWS TEST AS WELL,37.455,40.410
BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_7,SO IN HIS MIND HE FELT GUILTY BECAUSE HE ONLY HAD GIVEN ME TWO WEEKS TO PREPARE,40.410,45.190
BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_8,BUT IN MY MIND I KNEW IN MY HEART I HAD BEEN PREPARING FOR YEARS,45.190,50.245
BT2XlI8oeh0/00012_9,SO THIS IS A LESSON AS WELL THAT I HAD LEARNED FROM MY OLDER BROTHER SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY APPROACHED ME ABOUT HIM BUT MY OLDER BROTHER IS AN ACTOR AND HE STARED IN A MOVIE THAT CAME OUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR CALLED TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE,50.245,63.735

BT2XlI8oeh0/00008_1,AND HOW SHE SHOULD PREPARE,4.265,5.810
BT2XlI8oeh0/00008_2,SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMPETITION I BELIEVE IN CREATING WHAT I WANT I DON'T BELIEVE IN COMPETING FOR WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN CREATED,5.810,12.910
BT2XlI8oeh0/00008_3,THE THIRD THING I HONESTLY BELIEVE IS,12.910,15.785
BT2XlI8oeh0/00008_4,TO GIVE,15.785,16.855
BT2XlI8oeh0/00008_5,BECAUSE IT,16.855,18.345

BT2XlI8oeh0/00008_7,THAT THE MORE YOU GIVE,20.990,22.615

BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_0,UNFORTUNATELY LOT OF THESE NEWS STATIONS RECEIVE THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS THOUSANDS OF TAPES SO IT TOOK THEM SEVERAL MONTHS TO GET BACK TO ME,0.000,7.435
BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_1,AND DURING THAT TIME THE RECESSION KICKED IN AND I LOST MY JOB,7.435,10.800

BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_3,I DECIDED ANYWAY THAT I WAS GOING TO MOVE TO NEW YORK AND JUST HOPE,13.875,18.065
BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_4,THAT THIS ONE STATION WOULD GET BACK TO ME,18.065,20.510

BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_7,SPOT,35.530,37.230
BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_8,SO THAT'S WHY I,37.230,39.600
BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_9,SAY TRUST YOUR STRUGGLE,39.600,41.605
BT2XlI8oeh0/00007_10,THE SECOND THING I BELIEVE AND THIS SORT OF COMES OUT OF LEFT FIELD IS I HONESTLY DO,41.605,-1.000
BT2XlI8oeh0/00001_0,FOUR FOUR AND HALF YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING AS A RECEPTIONIST AND THE REASON WHY I SHARE THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT SUCCESS IS NEVER REALLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE,0.000,10.405

BT2XlI8oeh0/00001_3,BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THE STORY THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT IN THEIR CHOSEN CAREERS,21.070,29.260
BT2XlI8oeh0/00001_4,THERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTRAODINARILY TALENTED WHO KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL EDUCATED WHO DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT SO IF IT'S NOT ALWAYS HARD WORK WHAT THEN DETERMINES WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL,29.260,42.270

3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00018_2,DOESN'T MEAN I'M BAD OR STUPID SO,12.675,15.785
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00018_3,THESE TRAITS THIS CLUSTER OF TRAITS IS WHAT RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND AND I'VE ALSO FOUND ANECDOTALLY PREDICTS GOOD JUDGMENT,15.785,24.480
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00018_4,AND THE KEY TAKEAWAY I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ABOUT THOSE TRAITS IS THAT,24.480,29.430
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00018_5,THEY'RE PRIMARILY NOT ABOUT HOW SMART YOU ARE OR ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU KNOW,29.430,34.225

3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00018_7,THEY'RE ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL,37.335,39.470

3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00007_0,INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT THE DREYFUS AFFAIR IS THIS QUESTION OF WHY THE OFFICERS WERE SO CONVINCED THAT DREYFUS WAS GUILTY,0.000,7.940
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00007_1,MEAN YOU MIGHT EVEN ASSUME THAT THEY WERE SETTING HIM UP THEY WERE INTENTIONALLY FRAMING HIM BUT HISTORIANS DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THE OFFICERS GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT THE CASE AGAINST DREYFUS WAS STRONG,7.940,20.365

3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00007_3,YOU KNOW MAKES YOU WONDER,21.555,23.100
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00007_4,WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE HUMAN MIND THAT WE CAN FIND SUCH PALTRY EVIDENCE TO BE COMPELLING ENOUGH TO CONVICT A MAN,23.100,30.255
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00007_5,WELL,30.255,31.610
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00007_6,THIS IS A CASE OF WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL MOTIVATED REASONING,31.610,-1.000

3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00004_0,IN THE ARMY AND UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME THE FRENCH ARMY WAS HIGHLY ANTI SEMITIC,0.000,4.975
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00004_1,SO THEY COMPARED DREYFUS'S HANDWRITING TO THAT ON THE MEMO,4.975,8.365
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00004_2,AND INCLUDED THAT IT WAS A MATCH EVEN THOUGH OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL HANDWRITING EXPERTS WERE MUCH LESS CONFIDENT IN THE SIMILARITY BUT NEVER MIND THAT,8.365,16.925
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00004_3,THEY WENT AND SEARCHED DREYFUS'S APARTMENT LOOKING FOR ANY SIGNS OF ESPIONAGE THEY WENT THROUGH HIS FILES,16.925,22.110
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00004_4,AND THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING,22.110,23.815
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00004_5,AND THIS JUST CONVINCED THEM MORE THAT DREYFUS WAS NOT ONLY GUILTY BUT SNEAKY AS WELL BECAUSE CLEARLY HE HAD HIDDEN ALL OF THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THEY HAD MANAGED TO GET TO IT,23.815,32.145
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00004_6,NEXT THEY WENT AND LOOKED THROUGH HIS PERSONAL HISTORY FOR ANY INCRIMINATING DETAILS THEY TALKED TO HIS TEACHERS THEY FOUND THAT HE HAD STUDIED FOREIGN LANGUAGES IN SCHOOL WHICH CLEARLY SHOWED DESIRE TO CONSPIRE WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS LATER IN,32.145,47.230

3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00019_1,WHAT WE NEED MOST IS NOT MORE INSTRUCTION IN LOGIC OR RHETORIC OR PROBABILITY OR ECONOMICS EVEN THOUGH THOSE THINGS ARE QUITE VALUABLE BUT WHAT WE MOST NEED TO USE THOSE PRINCIPLES WELL IS SCOUT MINDSET,1.325,15.295
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00019_2,WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE FEEL,15.295,17.470
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00019_3,WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FEEL PROUD INSTEAD OF ASHAMED WHEN WE NOTICE WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING,17.470,23.970
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00019_4,WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO FEEL INTRIGUED INSTEAD OF DEFENSIVE WHEN WE ENCOUNTER SOME INFORMATION THAT CONTRADICTS OUR BELIEFS,23.970,32.060
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00019_5,SO THE QUESTION I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS,32.060,35.550
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00019_6,WHAT DO YOU MOST YEARN FOR,35.550,38.250
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00019_7,DO YOU YEARN TO DEFEND YOUR OWN BELIEFS,38.250,-1.000
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00009_0,AS RESEARCHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED IF YOU SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND THE STUDY SHOWS THAT IS NOT EFFECTIVE THEN YOU'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO FIND ALL THE REASONS WHY THE STUDY WAS POORLY DESIGNED,0.000,11.365
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00009_1,BUT IF IT SHOWS THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WORKS AWESOME IT'S A GOOD STUDY AND VICE VERSA IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SAME THING OUR JUDGMENT IS JUST STRONGLY INFLUENCED UNCONSCIOUSLY BY WHICH SIDE WE WANT TO WIN AND,11.365,23.660
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00009_2,THIS IS UBIQUITOUS THIS SHAPES HOW WE THINK ABOUT OUR HEALTH RELATIONSHIPS,23.660,28.900

3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00009_4,AND WHAT'S MOST SCARY TO ME ABOUT MOTIVATED REASONING OR SOLDIER MINDSET IS HOW UNCONSCIOUS IT IS,33.590,39.070
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00009_5,WE CAN THINK WE'RE BEING OBJECTIVE AND FAIR MINDED AND STILL WIND UP RUINING THE LIFE OF AN INNOCENT MAN,39.070,46.420
3MYEtQ5Zdn8/00009_6,HOWEVER FORTUNATELY FOR DREYFUS HIS STORY IS NOT,46.420,-1.000

CDdpQSLr7YE/00002_3,AND THIS IS A VERY USEFUL INDUSTRIAL KIND OF POLYMER BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN MY GROUP AT MIT IS TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE BRAIN,10.175,-1.000

CDdpQSLr7YE/00007_2,MAYBE WE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN CONDUCTS INFORMATION FROM SENSORY REGIONS MIXES IT WITH EMOTION AND FEELING AND GENERATES OUR DECISIONS AND,9.760,-1.000
CDdpQSLr7YE/00023,ARGUE THAT WITH TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THE KINDS I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY MAYBE WE CAN ACTUALLY DERIVE THOSE WE CAN MAP THE PATTERNS THAT OCCUR IN LIVING SYSTEMS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO OVERCOME THE DISEASES THAT PLAGUE,0.000,-1.000

8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_3,YOU EVEN LIKE KALE,7.720,9.830
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_4,I GET IT IT IS OVERWHELMING ALL OF THE CHOICES WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY ALL OF THE THINGS WE'RE ASKED TO CONSIDER ABOUT OUR FOOD,9.830,17.040
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_5,A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AGO I SET MYSELF A CHALLENGE,17.040,20.745
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_6,ONE YEAR WITHOUT PROCESSED FOOD,20.745,24.070
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_7,THE FIRST QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK ARE WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,24.070,27.855
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_8,AND WHAT MAKES A FOOD PROCESSED,27.855,30.500
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_9,AND I'LL GET TO THOSE,30.500,32.210
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_10,BUT TONIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT CHOICE OF A WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT TO EAT,32.210,37.620
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_11,I AM A FOOD WRITER SO ON SOME LEVEL I'M PAID TO THINK ABOUT THAT CHOICE I'M THE EDITOR OF EDIBLE BAJA ARIZONA A LOCAL FOOD MAGAZINE BASED HERE IN TUCSON,37.620,45.605
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_12,BUT I ALSO HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT THESE CHOICES MATTER,45.605,48.720
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_13,THAT THEY IMPACT THE FOOD SYSTEM AND WE HAVE THE POWER TO UNPROCESS THE FOODS WE,48.720,53.530
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_14,EAT,53.530,54.310
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00001_15,SO WHAT MAKES A FOOD,54.310,-1.000
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00014_0,WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE AMOUNT I SPENT TO FEED MYSELF THREE MOSTLY ORGANIC LARGELY LOCAL TOTALLY UNPROCESSED MEALS FOR A YEAR WAS ABOUT 4 DOLLARS 50 CENTS A MEAL,0.000,10.485
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00014_1,I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR WHOM 4 50C A MEAL IS SIMPLY UNAFFORDABLE IT IS OUT OF THEIR REACH I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT I DEDICATED THE LAST CHAPTER OF MY BOOK TO THE ENDEAVOR OF EATING UNPROCESSED ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT FOOD STAMPS RECIPIENTS RECEIVE WHICH IS ABOUT 20 DOLLARS A WEEK,10.485,27.280
8Ug1MnU6LKw/00014_2,BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS MOST OF US HAVE A FEW DOLLARS THAT WE COULD SPEND DIFFERENTLY,27.280,33.430

8Ug1MnU6LKw/00017_0,APART FROM ALL THAT THE REASON FOR EATING UNPROCESSED MAKES SENSE TO ME IS THAT IT IS SIMPLER,0.000,4.410

8Ug1MnU6LKw/00017_5,AFTER ALL THE POINT OF FOOD IS NOT TO STRESS US OUT IT IS TO BRING US TOGETHER,22.395,27.760

48NRknBcz6k/00015_13,ONE EXAMPLE IS THE RADIO TELESCOPE,43.775,47.225
48NRknBcz6k/00015_14,A RADIO TELESCOPE CAN SEND,47.225,49.690
48NRknBcz6k/00015_15,RADIO SIGNALS TO A DISTANT PLANET AND HOPEFULLY GET,49.690,53.875

48NRknBcz6k/00015_18,ANOTHER THING THAT WE ARE USING RIGHT NOW THAT IS REALLY GREAT IS THE TELESCOPE,62.545,68.230
48NRknBcz6k/00015_19,FOR NOW WE HAVE FOUND MORE THAN A THOUSAND EXOPLANETS THAT IS PLANETS,68.230,74.330

48NRknBcz6k/00015_22,SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT IT IS ONLY DUE TO SIZE PLANETS OUTSIDE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,81.345,88.900
48NRknBcz6k/00015_23,NO IT IS JUST MUCH EASIER TO FIND BIGGER PLANETS,88.900,93.360
48NRknBcz6k/00015_24,THAN SMALLER,93.360,94.855
48NRknBcz6k/00015_25,BUT WE HAVE FOUND ABOUT 20 SO CALLED SUPER EARTHS THAT IS PLANETS,94.855,100.880

EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_4,IT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD IT FELT REALLY UNFAIR ACTUALLY DARING TWO X CHROMOSOMES FROM THE LOTTERY LEFT ME FAR FROM WINNING I FELT LIKE I HAD TO BE AFRAID,15.080,23.885
EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_5,I FELT LIKE I HAD TO KEEP MY GUARD UP AT ALL TIMES AND I WASN'T FAIR,23.885,28.605

EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_7,YOU KNOW WHY MAYBE THAT WAS THE CASE AND I DIDN'T IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME YET THAT LIFE IS UNFAIR AND SO I WOULD THINK,36.705,44.165
EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_8,MAYBE JUST MAYBE IN A CYNDI LAUPER ESCALADE MAYBE GIRLS JUST HAVE MORE FUN AT THE END OF IT ALL AND SO MAYBE IT'LL JUST END OF ADDING UP AND SO IT'LL END UP BEING PRETTY EQUAL BUT,44.165,55.220
EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_9,I,55.220,56.370
EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_10,DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE THAT GIRLS HAVE MORE FUN AND EVEN IF IT IS,56.370,60.370
EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_11,IT DOESN'T QUITE RECONCILE THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR,60.370,65.180
EZ9tC3PigiU/00002_12,AND SO I WONDER IS THIS FEAR THAT WE EXPERIENCED IS IT VALID WELL LET'S SEE,65.180,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00006_0,I ASKED HIM I SAID I AM WORKING ON THIS PROJECT WILL YOU BE MY STRANGER OF THE DAY,0.000,4.835
EZ9tC3PigiU/00006_1,BEFORE EVEN EXPLAINING WHAT IT WAS HE SAID YES THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S THAT UNTIL YOU SURE THAT YOU WANT TO MEET STRANGERS ISN'T IT HE SAID YES I APOLOGIZED AND SAID I KNOW YOU ARE WORKING BUT,4.835,18.225
EZ9tC3PigiU/00006_2,ANYWAYS HE AGREED TO IT AND SO IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY ACTUALLY EVERY TIME HE WOULD WALK PASS HER TABLE AND IMMIDIATELY HE WOULD DROP A FIVE SECOND FACT ABOUT HIMSELF AND,18.225,29.660
EZ9tC3PigiU/00006_3,THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT HE HOSTS MEDITATION SESSION IN HIS HOUSE,29.660,36.320
EZ9tC3PigiU/00006_4,THE SECOND TIME HE CAME AROUND HE SAID THAT HE USED TO WORK IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THAT HE USED TO STUDY BUSSINESS AND AT THE END OF IT ALL I ASKED HIMSELF IF IT COULD GO AND MAYBE JOIN ONE OF HIS MEDITATION SESSION SOMETIME AND HE SAID SURE AND I DID AND IT WAS AMAZING,36.320,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_0,JUST COMING BACK FROM WORK AND I WAS WORKING PRETTY BRISKLY,0.000,2.905
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_1,I WAS AFRAID THAT IT'D HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND SHAMARI WAS SITTING ON HIS BIKE LOOKING BACK TOWARDS ME,2.905,9.585
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_2,AND,9.585,11.390
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_3,HE LOOKED KIND OF CURIOUS AND AS I WALKED PAST KIND OF SHOUTED OUT AT ME AND I FELT KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE BUT WE WERE IN A PARK AND IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND I THOUGHT WHAT IS THESE REALLY TO LOSE IF I ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION AND SO HE KIND OF FOLLOWED ME ON HIS BIKE AND I WAS,11.390,31.785
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_4,TALKING TO HIM WE WERE JUST HAVING A CONVSERSATION AND,31.785,37.545
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_5,USUALLY I WOULD HAVE BOOKED IT BUT I DECIDED YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE I REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE SO WE GOT TO TALKING AND AT ONE POINT IN OUR CONVERSATION HE ACTUALLY FELL HALFWAY OFF OF HIS BIKE AND I WAS LIKE ARE YOU OKAY AND HE SAID I GOT LOST IN YOUR EYESSORRY AND AT THIS POINT I,37.545,60.335
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_6,WAS JUST FEELING REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT NOW,60.335,67.045
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_7,FAST TRACK TO THE END OF OUR COVERSATION,67.045,70.455
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_8,HE HAD MENTIONED THINGS ABOUT DO YOU THINK THAT WOMEN IN VANCOUVER STUCK UP DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THIS AND AT THE END OF OUR CONVERSATION,70.455,81.065
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_9,WE GOT TO TALKING ABOUT,81.065,84.265
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_10,HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT I TOLD HIM THAT I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THAT HE WAS TALKING TO ME,84.265,90.035
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_11,AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN HE SAID YOU KNOW HOW CAN I APPROACH PEOPLE WITH MORE RESPECT,90.035,97.195
EZ9tC3PigiU/00011_12,I DON'T LIKE THAT I MADE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND SO IT TURNED INTO THIS,97.195,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_0,ME HE USED TO RELATE HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS WIFE USED TO COMPARE IT TO THE RELATIONSHIPS OF HIS FRIENDS AND THEIR PARTNERS,0.000,7.535
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_1,AND HE FOUND THAT IN THIS PROCESS OF COMPARING HIMSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE HE WASN'T REALLY GETTING ANYWHERE IT WASN'T VERY PRODUCTIVE,7.535,14.840
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_2,DIDN'T MAKE HIM HAPPIER AND HIS BIGGEST LEARNING FROM IT WAS THAT HE REALIZED IT WAS ACTUALLY AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY TO COMPARE SOMETHING SO QUALITATIVE TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO QUITE QUALITATIVE IS REALLY NOT,14.840,28.080
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_3,A PRODUCTIVE EXERCISE THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM IT,28.080,31.965
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_4,AND I THOUGHT ABOUT,31.965,34.075
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_5,WHY IT IS THAT MAYBE WE DON'T APPROACH STRANGERS AS MUCH IN OUR EVERYDAY AND,34.075,40.390
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_6,I THINK,40.390,41.435
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_7,PART OF IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH WE COMPARE OURSELVES TO OTHER PEOPLE AND HOW WE KEEP OURSELVES IN THESE BOXES,41.435,47.485
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_8,AND EVEN ON FACEBOOK WHEN YOU SEE A PROFILE PICTURE AND HOW MANY LIKES IT HAS IT IS KIND OF AWAY OF QUANTIFYING,47.485,54.590
EZ9tC3PigiU/00010_9,THIS VALUE THAT WE HAVE IS PEOPLE IN IT COMPARES IT IN THAT WAY IN A WAY THAT TRIES TO QUANTIFY IT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING,54.590,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00005_0,MUCH MORE THAN JUST A JANITOR SHE ME ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD AND HOW SHE GREW UP IN THE PHILIPPINES AND SHE LIVED IN THE VILLAGE THAT DIDN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY AT THE TIME,0.000,9.090

EZ9tC3PigiU/00005_4,AND THIS WAS SUCH AN INTERESTING STORY THAT SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS REALLY GRATEFUL FOR WHAT SHE DOES HAVE NOW,19.730,25.275
EZ9tC3PigiU/00005_5,REFLECTING ON THAT STORY AND I FELT REALLY INSPIRED FROM THIS AND WITHOUT HAVING SPOKEN TO HER I WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN THIS,25.275,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_0,THAT BEING A WOMAN MADE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY COULD TRUST ME MORE,0.000,4.570
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_1,AND,4.570,5.645
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_2,THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A WEIRD CLAIM BUT THERE,5.645,8.645
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_3,IS SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S WORKING ON A SIMILAR PROJECT HERE IN VANCOUVER ACTUALLY CALLED THEM THE STRANGER PROJECT WHICH I FOUND OUT ABOUT AFTERWARDS AND,8.645,17.650
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_4,WHAT'S NEEDED IS THAT,17.650,19.880
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_5,FOR HIS PROJECT HE APPROACHES PEOPLE AND,19.880,22.565
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_6,HE DOCUMENTS THEM ONLINE AS WELL,22.565,24.920
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_7,AND HE LISTS HOW,24.920,27.220
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_8,MANY TIMES IT TAKES HIM BEFORE HE,27.220,30.750
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_9,GETS TO TALK TO A STRANGER WHO AGREES TO SPEAK WITH THEM AS WELL,30.750,34.710
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_10,AND SOMETIMES IT IS 5 OR 6 OR 7 PEOPLE THAT HE HAS TO TALK TO BEFOREHAND,34.710,40.455
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_11,FOR ME,40.455,42.115
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_12,THERE WAS ONLY LIKE ONE AND A HALF TIMES WHERE I GOT KIND OF REJECTION FROM STRANGER BUT FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS WILLING TO SPEAK WITH ME,42.115,50.700
EZ9tC3PigiU/00012_13,AND SO I DREW CONNECTION WITH THIS BACK TO,50.700,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_0,ON DAY 101,0.000,1.655
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_1,I MET A WOMAN NAMED LYNN SHE WAS WALKING PAST ME IN THE PARK,1.655,5.220
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_2,AND I STOPPED AND I ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE A MOMENT TO TALK AND SHE SAID SHE TOOK A STEP BACK TO TOOK A LOOK AT ME AND SHE SAID I GUESS I HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO TALK,5.220,16.805
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_3,HALF AN HOUR LATER WE WERE STILL TALKING,16.805,20.245
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_4,AND SHE WAS SHARING WITH ME A STORY FROM TIME 30 YEARS AGO WHEN A STRANGER HAD TREATED HER WITH UTMOST KINDNESS A COMPLETE STRANGER AND SHE WAS REFLECTING ON THIS MOMENT IN HER LIFE AND SHE WAS MOVED TO TEARS OF JOY,20.245,34.740
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_5,SHE WAS MOVED TO TEARS THINKING ABOUT THIS KINDNESS FROM A STRANGER,34.740,39.990
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_6,SHE WAS SO VULNERABLE AND OPEN AND COMPLETELY WHOLEHEARTEDLY TRUSTING ME WITH THIS STORY AND SO AT THE END OF IT ALL,39.990,49.900
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_7,THEY PROBABLY ARE SOME KHARAB UNCLE OUT THERE WHEN WE WERE WALKING ON THE STREET BUT I GUARANTEE YOU THAT NOT EVERYONE IS ONE,49.900,56.695

EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_9,IF WE CAN FEEL MORE CONNECTED IN OUR SPACES THEN WE WILL FEEL SAFER WE'LL FEEL HAPPIER,57.865,64.700
EZ9tC3PigiU/00016_10,WE WILL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND MORE CONNECTED LESS ISOLATED,64.700,69.505

EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_6,I ALWAYS LAUGH BECAUSE,21.150,23.475
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_7,I JUST THINK ABOUT HOW FUNNY IT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A BAD GUY MY PARENTS CALLED HIM AN UNCLE BECAUSE DISCLAIMER TO BROWN PARENTS EVERY SINGLE ADULT IS EITHER AN UNCLE OR AN AUNT TO YOU,23.475,34.130
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_8,SO I SHOULD'T REALLY HAVE THEM SUPPRISED,34.130,36.860
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_9,ANYWAYS,36.860,38.690
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_10,I HAVE A VERY DISTINCT MEMORY FROM MY CHILDHOOD OF WHEN I WAS SITTING ON THE OLD CARPET IN OUR,38.690,45.335
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_11,TOWN HOME IN BURNABY AND I WAS SITTING ON TOP OF THE WARM HEATER VENT AND PEERING OUTSIDE LOOKING ONTO THE STREET,45.335,52.590

EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_13,AND I REMEMBER QUITE VIVIDLY SEEING A CAR PULL UP INTO OUR DRIVEWAY IT WAS A WHITE CAR AND REMEMBER MY HEART STARTED TO RACE AND I THOUGHT OH NO KHARAAB UNCLE IS REALLY COMING,56.900,68.070
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_14,TO GET ME I REALLY DID I REALLY DID THINK THAT IT TURNED OUT THAT CAR JUST TURNED AROUND AND WENT THE OTHER WAY I GUESS IT HAD BEEN GOING ON SOMEWHERE ELSE,68.070,78.770
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_15,BUT IT IS A SMALL THING BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT THIS MARK IS THE BEGINNING OF THE TRAJECTORY OF FEAR IN MY NARRATIVE,78.770,85.810
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_16,AND,85.810,86.700
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_17,IT STARTED TO GET ME TO THINK ABOUT,86.700,89.330
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_18,THE OTHER AS SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF IS SOMETHING THAT I NEEDED TO FEAR,89.330,95.010

EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_20,WEREN'T SO COMFORTABLE WITH ME TAKING THE BUS BY MYSELF,100.250,103.980
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_21,MY DAD WOULD INSIST ON DRIVING ME TO MY MEETINGS IN MY EVENTS BECAUSE HE FOUND THAT I WOULD BE SAFER THAT WAY,103.980,110.690
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_22,AND,110.690,111.670
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_23,OF COURSE THIS WOULD GET ME TO THINK WELL I GUESS THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE BUS THAT I NEED TO BE AFRAID OF MAYBE I SHOULD,111.670,118.695
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_24,YOU KNOW STAY AWAY MAYBE I SHOULD KEEP MY DISTANCE,118.695,122.140
EZ9tC3PigiU/00001_25,I,122.140,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00014_0,BUT THAT IS GENERALLY THE CASE I REALIZED AND I THOUGH OKAY SO,0.000,4.240
EZ9tC3PigiU/00014_1,I CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN FEAR IN THIS WAY,4.240,6.960
EZ9tC3PigiU/00014_2,OR MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH I CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND MAYBE SLOWLY WE CAN LIFT OURSELVES OUT OF THIS IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY,6.960,14.695
EZ9tC3PigiU/00014_3,ANOTHER,14.695,-1.000
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_0,HIS ENTIRE SUMMER WORKING A DIFFERENT JOB EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO COOL IMAGE HOW MUCH HE LEARNED ABOUT HIMSELF ABOUT WHAT HE LIKES ABOUT WHAT HE DOESN'T LIKE ABOUT,0.000,10.755
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_1,WHAT THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE,10.755,13.020
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_2,ARE LIKE SO THIS SUMMER I HAD A BIT OF FREE TIME I WAS WORKING A COUPLE OF CONTRACT JOBS BUT I HAD SOME FREE TIME TO KILL AND I WANTED TO START A PROJECT OF MY,13.020,21.755
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_3,OWN SO I REFLECTED ON,21.755,23.740
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_4,WHAT THE KIND OF THINGS WERE THAT ENERGIZE ME IN MY LIFE AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE ONE ON ONE CONVERSATIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE WITH PEOPLE,23.740,31.850
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_5,SO OFTEN WE ASKED EACH OTHER YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU DO WHERE DO YOU WORK AND WE NEVER REALLY ASKED THOSE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU LOVE WHAT DRIVES YOU AND I WANTED TO START ASKING MORE MEANINGFUL QUESTIONS LIKE THIS,31.850,45.670
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_6,AND SO,45.670,47.120
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_7,I GREW UP KIND OF A PERFECTIONIST AND THIS IS MY LAST DISCLAIMER BUT I GREW UP AS KIND OF A PERFECTIONIST WHERE I'D LIKE TO PLAN THESE PROJECT OUT AND I REALIZED OVER TIME THAT,47.120,55.935
EZ9tC3PigiU/00004_8,YOU'RE PLANNING OUT PROJECTS METICULOUSLY SOMETIMES IT PREVENTS YOU FROM STARTING THEM AT ALL,55.935,61.090

8etnSTnX92g/00012_8,AND IT'S A NECESSITY TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT,22.860,26.030
8etnSTnX92g/00012_9,SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR LIVES AND FEEL AS IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING THEY ARE,26.030,33.580

8etnSTnX92g/00016_4,PUNCTUATION,12.635,13.925

8etnSTnX92g/00016_6,AND A LITTLE BIT MORE DISASTROUS,18.085,21.160

63tVsJI31Tk/00001_8,REASON WHY THAT QUOTE RESONATES WITH ME SO MUCH IS BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME HOW DIFFICULT A LIFE CAN BE WHEN YOU MOVE INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITHOUT SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE HAVING ANY FRIENDS OR KNOWING THEIR CULTURE,27.245,38.735

gBGt5OeAQFk/00021,STEFANO SO CONSCIOUSNESS IS JUST YOUR ABILITY TO BUILD A MODEL OF YOURSELF IN RELATION TO THE SPACE TO THE OTHER ORGANISMS AND TO THE TIME ARE PLANTS ABLE TO DO THAT,0.000,-1.000
gBGt5OeAQFk/00005,IT'S A KIND OF TOOL THAT PROTECTS OUR BRAIN TO BE OVERLOADED WITH A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS USELESS GREEN STUFF,0.000,-1.000
gBGt5OeAQFk/00012_0,AND THE SECOND THE SECOND POINT IS THAT PLANTS HAVE NO ORGANS,0.000,4.715
gBGt5OeAQFk/00012_1,THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLE DIFFERENCE WITH THE ANIMALS,4.715,10.235
gBGt5OeAQFk/00012_2,SO I MEAN ANIMALS CONCENTRATE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS INSIDE SPECIFIC ORGANS SO WE HAVE EYES TO SEE WE HAVE LUNGS FOR BREATHING WE HAVE THE STOMACH TO DIGEST AND SO ON,10.235,24.130
gBGt5OeAQFk/00012_3,BUT THE PLANTS EVOLVED NOT TO HAVE ANY ORGANS BECAUSE HAVING AN ORGAN IS TOO DANGEROUS,24.130,30.780
gBGt5OeAQFk/00012_4,FOR PLANTS THAT HAVE,30.780,32.935

gBGt5OeAQFk/00033_3,OF THE OTHER PLANTS SO NORMALLY FOR EXAMPLE BEANS THE VERY COMMON BEAN,8.230,14.345

fSOupkS4VVo/00018,THIS IS FROM ANY MOTHER IT COULD REALLY BE A PHEROMONE IT'S NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION ANY MOTHER WILL DO NOW WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT APART FROM BEING SIMPLY VERY INTERESTING,0.000,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00008_0,IT VERY CAREFULLY HE SYNTHESIZED THE MOLECULE,0.000,2.650
fSOupkS4VVo/00008_1,AND THEN TRIED THE SYNTHESIZED MOLECULE ON THE MALES AND GOT THEM,2.650,6.990

fSOupkS4VVo/00008_3,THAT'S CLOSING THE CIRCLE,10.305,12.335
fSOupkS4VVo/00008_4,THAT'S THE THING WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DONE WITH HUMANS NOTHING SYSTEMATIC NO REAL DEMONSTRATION,12.335,18.600
fSOupkS4VVo/00008_5,WITH THAT NEW CONCEPT WE NEEDED A NEW,18.600,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00007_0,ADOLF BUTENANDT AND HIS TEAM,0.000,1.865

fSOupkS4VVo/00007_3,HE BASICALLY WENT THROUGH SYSTEMATICALLY SHOWING THAT ONLY THE MOLECULE IN QUESTION WAS THE ONE THAT STIMULATED THE MALES NOT ALL THE OTHERS,11.605,20.670
fSOupkS4VVo/00007_4,HE,20.670,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00001,IS A VERY POWERFUL WORD IT CONJURES UP SEX,0.000,-1.000

fSOupkS4VVo/00014_3,ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF MOLECULES,10.535,13.730
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_4,WHEN THEY'RE SECRETED FROM THE GLANDS THE MOLECULES ARE ODORLESS THEY HAVE NO SMELL AT ALL AND IT'S ONLY THE WONDERFUL BACTERIA,13.730,21.755
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_5,GROWING ON THE RAINFOREST OF HAIR THAT ACTUALLY PRODUCES THE SMELLS THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE,21.755,27.445
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_6,AND SO INCIDENTALLY IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SMELL,27.445,30.500
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_7,CLEAR CUTTING YOUR ARMPITS IS VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING THE HABITAT FOR BACTERIA AND YOU'LL FIND THEY REMAIN LESS SMELLY FOR MUCH LONGER,30.500,40.535
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_8,BUT ALTHOUGH WE'VE FOCUSED ON ARMPITS I THINK IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE THE LEAST EMBARRASSING PLACE TO GO AND ASK PEOPLE FOR SAMPLES,40.535,48.550
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_9,THERE IS ACTUALLY ANOTHER REASON WHY WE MIGHT NOT BE LOOKING FOR A UNIVERSAL SEX PHEROMONE THERE,48.550,54.165
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_10,AND THAT'S BECAUSE 20 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION,54.165,58.085
fSOupkS4VVo/00014_11,DOESN'T HAVE SMELLY ARMPITS LIKE ME,58.085,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_0,STILL YOU'LL FIND WEBSITES THAT OFFER THIS AS A MAJOR QUIRK,0.000,4.345
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_1,AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH WE SPEND ABOUT AS MUCH MONEY TAKING THE SMELLS OFF US,4.345,10.330
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_2,AS PUTTING THEM BACK ON IN PERFUMES,10.330,12.935
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_3,AND PERFUMES ARE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS,12.935,16.590
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_4,SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THE REST OF THIS TALK,16.590,19.885
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_5,IS,19.885,21.295
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_6,TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT PHEROMONES REALLY ARE,21.295,24.835
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_7,TELL YOU WHY I THINK WE WOULD EXPECT,24.835,28.175
fSOupkS4VVo/00004_8,HUMANS TO HAVE PHEROMONES,28.175,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00017,WE GO TO ANY MOTHER WHO IS SECRETING FROM THE AREOLAR GLANDS SO IT'S NOT ABOUT RECOGNITION IT CAN BE FROM ANY MOTHER IF WE TAKE THE SECRETION AND NOW PUT IT UNDER THE BABY'S,0.000,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_0,IF YOU DON'T GET IT,0.000,1.320
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_1,YOU WON'T SURVIVE YOU'LL BE DEAD,1.320,3.875
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_2,SINCE MANY BABIES ACTUALLY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO TAKE THAT FIRST MEAL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT STIMULUS,3.875,10.180
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_3,IF WE COULD IDENTIFY WHAT THAT MOLECULE WAS,10.180,13.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_4,AND THE FRENCH TEAM ARE BEING VERY CAUTIOUS BUT IF WE COULD IDENTIFY THE MOLECULE,13.000,17.695
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_5,SYNTHESIZE IT IT WOULD THEN MEAN PREMATURE BABIES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO SUCKLE,17.695,22.315
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_6,AND EVERY BABY WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL,22.315,26.005
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_7,SO WHAT I WANT TO ARGUE IS THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF WHERE A SYSTEMATIC,26.005,30.170
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_8,REALLY SCIENTIFIC APPROACH CAN ACTUALLY BRING YOU A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF PHEROMONES THERE COULD BE ALL SORTS OF MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS THERE COULD BE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HUMANS ARE DOING WITH PHEROMONES THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW AT THE MOMENT,30.170,43.920
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_9,WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS PHEROMONES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SEX THEY'RE ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO DO WITH A MAMMAL'S LIFE,43.920,50.520
fSOupkS4VVo/00019_10,SO DO GO FORWARD AND DO SEARCH FOR MORE THERE'S LOTS TO FIND THANK YOU VERY MUCH,50.520,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_0,ANIMALS IN FEMALE ANIMALS IT WORKS JUST AS WELL UNDERWATER FOR GOLDFISH AND LOBSTERS,0.000,5.050
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_1,AND ALMOST EVERY MAMMAL YOU CAN THINK OF HAS HAD A PHEROMONE IDENTIFIED,5.050,8.745
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_2,AND OF COURSE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF INSECTS,8.745,12.230
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_3,SO WE KNOW THAT PHEROMONES EXIST RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE ANIMAL KINGDOM,12.230,16.900
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_4,WHAT ABOUT HUMANS,16.900,18.950
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_5,WELL THE FIRST THING OF COURSE IS THAT WE'RE MAMMALS AND MAMMALS SMELLY,18.950,23.530
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_6,AS ANY DOG OWNER CAN TELL YOU,23.530,25.470
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_7,WE SMELL THEY SMELL,25.470,27.395
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_8,BUT THE REAL REASON WE MIGHT THINK THAT HUMANS HAVE PHEROMONES,27.395,31.690
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_9,IS THE CHANGE THAT OCCURS AS WE GROW UP,31.690,34.545
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_10,THE SMELL OF A ROOM OF TEENAGERS IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE SMELL OF A ROOM OF SMALL CHILDREN,34.545,40.895
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_11,WHAT'S CHANGED AND OF COURSE IT'S PUBERTY,40.895,43.960
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_12,ALONG WITH THE PUBIC HAIR AND THE HAIR IN THE ARMPITS,43.960,47.515
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_13,NEW GLANDS START TO SECRETE IN THOSE PLACES,47.515,51.080
fSOupkS4VVo/00009_14,AND THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THE CHANGE IN SMELL,51.080,-1.000
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_0,AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH WHITE LAB COATS YOU MUST IMAGINE THAT THERE IS FANTASTIC SCIENCE BEHIND THIS,0.000,6.320
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_1,BUT SADLY,6.320,7.880
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_2,THESE ARE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS,7.880,11.020
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_3,SUPPORTED BY DODGY SCIENCE,11.020,14.635
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_4,THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY GOOD SCIENTISTS WORKING ON WHAT THEY THINK ARE HUMAN PHEROMONES,14.635,21.880
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_5,AND THEY'RE PUBLISHING IN RESPECTABLE JOURNALS,21.880,24.565
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_6,AT THE BASIS OF THIS DESPITE VERY SOPHISTICATED EXPERIMENTS,24.565,29.435
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_7,THERE REALLY IS NO GOOD SCIENCE BEHIND IT BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A PROBLEM,29.435,35.420
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_8,WHICH IS,35.420,36.490
fSOupkS4VVo/00003_9,NOBODY HAS SYSTEMATICALLY GONE THROUGH ALL THE ODORS THAT HUMANS PRODUCE AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MOLECULES THAT WE GIVE OFF,36.490,43.720

4mFzIumKKsc/00006_6,PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS RIGHT NOW ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE IN HELPING PEOPLE TO HEAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA,34.185,41.435
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_7,THERE'S A GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH ON THIS THAT COMES FROM DR REBECCA CAMPBELL,41.435,45.865
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_8,SHE FOUND THAT ONE OF THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF SOMEBODY BEING ABLE TO HEAL AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IS THE CARE THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THE FIRST PERSON THAT THEY TELL,45.865,56.455
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_9,IF THE VICTIM IS CARED FOR AND SUPPORTED THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO SHOW SYMPTOMS OF PTSD AND,56.455,62.505
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_10,THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP OR LEGAL COUNSEL,62.505,66.665
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_11,AS A CULTURE WE NEED TO BROADEN THIS PERSONAL LEVEL OF SUPPORT,66.665,71.050
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_12,WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO ALL SURVIVORS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THEIR LIFE THAT CARE IT SHOULD BE EMPOWERING FOR US TO KNOW THAT SIMPLY BY BEING SUPPORTIVE WE CAN HELP TO REVERSE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF,71.050,84.050
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_13,TRAUMA BUT PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF SUPPORT NOT ONLY HELPS PEOPLE TO HEAL FROM PREVIOUS ACTS OF VIOLENCE IT CAN ACTUALLY PREVENT FURTHER VICTIMIZATION SADLY ONE OF THE BEST PREDICTORS OF SOMEBODY BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IS HAVING A PRIOR HISTORY OF VICTIMIZATION,84.050,101.280
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_14,EACH ACT OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT REOCCURRING ONE FACTOR THAT POWERFULLY,101.280,106.310
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_15,MITIGATES THIS CYCLE IS THE RECEIVING OF PROPER CARE AND SUPPORT,106.310,113.480
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_16,IF THE SURVIVOR IS CARED FOR THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE RE VICTIMIZED,113.480,118.240
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_17,SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO BE PRESENT FOR SURVIVORS WE ARE LITERALLY KEEPING THEM SAFER GOING FORWARD,118.240,124.460
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_18,AND ONE FINAL BENEFIT TO THIS APPROACH IS WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER,124.460,130.705
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_19,WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE EVERY INSTANCE OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE IS REPORTED TO THE POLICE,130.705,137.545
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_20,BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE WHY DON'T MORE SURVIVORS REPORT,137.545,141.675
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_21,THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHAT CAN WE DO TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY ARE MORE COMFORTABLE DOING SO,141.675,147.595
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_22,SURVIVORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT THEIR CRIME TO THE POLICE IF THEY FEEL BELIEVED AND SUPPORTED BY THOSE WHOM THEY ARE CLOSE TO,147.595,155.265
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_23,EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE BEST STRATEGY FOR INCREASING REPORTING RATES,155.265,160.040
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_24,IS NOT TELLING THE VICTIM THAT THEY MUST GO TO THE POLICE,160.040,163.270
4mFzIumKKsc/00006_25,IT IS PROVIDING THEM WITH LOVE AND SUPPORT SO THEY HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO SO OF THEIR OWN ACCORD,163.270,168.765

4mFzIumKKsc/00005_2,THE REALITY IS EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WILL HAVE SOMEBODY IN THEIR LIFE THAT EITHER HAS OR WILL BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THIS PROBLEM SO EARLIER I POSED THE QUESTION HOW DO WE ENGAGE MORE MAN IN THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN,3.620,20.215
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_3,MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS LET'S START SMALL,20.215,24.300
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_4,LET'S START WITH DAY TO DAY THINGS LET'S START BY MAKING IT CLEAR TO THE WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DO CARE ABOUT,24.300,33.890
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_5,I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE REGARDLESS OF GENDER,33.890,37.840
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_6,BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MORE OF A CHALLENGE FOR MEN SO AS I POSED THESE QUESTIONS I'M POSING THEM FOR EVERYONE,37.840,46.145
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_7,BUT I WANT THE MEN THAT ARE LISTENING TO PAY ESPECIALLY CLOSE ATTENTION DO,46.145,50.075
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_8,YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE WOMEN THAT YOU CARE ABOUT SEE YOU AS AN ALLY IN THE CAUSE TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN WHEN IT COMES UP HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT RAPE WHEN IT COMES UP,50.075,64.315
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_9,HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT,64.315,66.430
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_10,DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHEN THERE'S A HIGH PROFILE CASE IN THE NEWS OR IN OUR POPULAR CULTURE DO,66.430,71.505
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_11,YOU EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS ABOUT THIS CASE,71.505,74.015
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_12,AND IF SO HOW DO YOU DO IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT VICTIM BLAMING' IS DO YOU KNOW WHAT RAPE MYTHS' ARE DO YOU,74.015,81.770
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_13,MAKE IT AN EFFORT TO AVOID ENDORSING THESE IDEAS AND IN THE MOST GENERAL OF TERMS WHAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE DO YOU USE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WOMEN WHAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE DO YOU USE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GENDER AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MEN DO YOU AUTOMATICALLY BECOME DEFENSIVE WHEN YOU HEAR DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN DO YOU AUTOMATICALLY BECOME DEFENSIVE WHEN YOU HEAR DISCUSSIONS AROUND MALE PRIVILEGE,81.770,109.520
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_14,IF SO HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT HOW THIS COMES ACCROSS TO THE WOMEN THAT YOU CARE ABOUT AND LASTLY DO PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU AND SAY THIS IS SOMEBODY I CAN SHARE MY STORY WITH,109.520,120.860
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_15,WITHOUT FEELING JUDGED OR BLAMED,120.860,123.340
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_16,THIS IS SOMEBODY WITH WHOM I CAN SHARE MY STORY AND FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL LISTEN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT,123.340,130.190
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_17,EARLIER WHEN I TALKED ABOUT ENGAGING MEN IN THIS CAUSE I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT GROWING THE RANKS OF MALE RESEARCHERS AND POLICY EXPERTS AND CLINICIANS,130.190,140.505
4mFzIumKKsc/00005_18,I BELIEVE THAT ENGAGING MEN IN THIS FIGHT CAN BEGIN BY ENCOURAGING THEM TO BE BETTER ALLIES AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN THE LIVES OF WOMEN THAT THEY ARE CLOSE TO AND,140.505,-1.000

4mFzIumKKsc/00001_3,MAN WORKING IN THIS FIELD I TAKE IT AS GIVEN THAT I WILL BE IN THE MINORITY BUT WHEN WE COMPARE THIS TO OTHER ISSUES OF SOCIAL CONCERN WE CAN SEE HOW UNIQUE THIS IS,30.390,42.370

4mFzIumKKsc/00004_3,IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE KNEW THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT I CARED ABOUT AND THAT I TOOK SERIOUSLY SHORTLY AFTER I BECAME MORE VIGILANT ABOUT THIS SOMETHING INTERESTING BEGAN TO HAPPEN,12.700,26.160
4mFzIumKKsc/00004_4,VARIOUS WOMEN THAT I KNOW BEGAN TO SHARE WITH ME THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF ABUSE AND ASSAULT SOMEONE SHARED WITH ME A STORY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THEY ENDURED AT WORK ANOTHER WOMAN DISCLOSED THAT SHE'D BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WHILE IN COLLEGE AND SHE WAS STILL STRUGGLING WITH SYMPTOMS OF PTSD AND,26.160,44.490

4mFzIumKKsc/00004_6,NONE OF THESE DISCLOSURES WERE THE RESULT OF PRYING OR PROMPTING,52.915,57.370
4mFzIumKKsc/00004_7,I HONESTLTY BELIEVE THAT SURVIVORS ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A WAY TO SHARE THEIR STORY AND I PRESENTED MYSELF AS SOMEBODY WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN IN A WAY MY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ALLOWED ME TO CARE ABOUT THIS MORE IN MY PERSONAL LIFE,57.370,71.070
4mFzIumKKsc/00004_8,AND IN TURN MY PERSONAL LIFE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES DEEPENED MY DESIRE TO MAKE THIS A PART OF MY PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY SO HOW DO WE GET MORE MEN TO CARE ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT CAUSE,71.070,83.160

4mFzIumKKsc/00003_14,SOMETIMES THIS CAME IN FORM OF A CURRENT ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO FLEE SOMETIMES IT CAME IN MEMORIES OF A CHILDHOOD MOURNED WITH THE YEARS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AT SOME OF THE PLACES I WORKED IT WAS ALMOST TAKEN AS A GIVEN THAT A CLIENT WOULD HAVE SUCH A HISTORY,55.785,72.670
4mFzIumKKsc/00003_15,A CLIENT WITHOUT A HISTORY OF ABUSE WAS THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVED THE RULE EVEN AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS EDUCATED AND AWARE,72.670,80.955

GIt6Z0k3PQo/00016_2,THEY GENERALLY SEEMED TO THINK WHY WOULD WE CARE WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE POLICE WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND DIDN'T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THEY WERE LOOKING AT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME STUFF,11.385,21.565
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00016_3,SO I STARTED TO INVESTIGATE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE WAY POLICE USE NONLETHAL WEAPONS WHEN THEY'RE INTRODUCED AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT ARISE OUT OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY DO INTRODUCE THEM,21.565,34.835
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00016_4,AND OF COURSE BEING AUSTRALIAN I STARTED LOOKING AT STUFF IN AUSTRALIA KNOWING FROM MY OWN,34.835,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00024_0,NOW ONE OF THE PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT COMES UP WITH MILITARY USE OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY THERE MIGHT BE SOME PROBLEMS THERE'S A COUPLE OF PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THAT GET FOCUSED ON,0.000,11.130
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00024_1,ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS IS,11.130,13.565
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00024_2,NONLETHAL WEAPONS MAY BE USED INDISCRIMINATELY ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MILITARY USE OF FORCE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE DISCRIMINATE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO YOU'RE SHOOTING AT,13.565,23.750
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00024_3,SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS SUGGESTED WITH NONLETHAL WEAPONS IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE USED INDISCRIMINATELY THAT YOU WOULD USE THEM AGAINST A WHOLE RANGE OF PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY SO MUCH,23.750,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00015,FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE USE OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS WOULD ALSO BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS WITH THE POLICE AND SINCE WE'VE ALREADY HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00013,BUT AS I SAID THE MILITARY AND THE POLICE ARE VERY DIFFERENT,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00018,THEY INTRODUCED OC SPRAY IN QUEENSLAND THEY WERE REALLY EXPLICIT THE POLICE MINISTER'S AND A HEAP OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT IT THEY WERE SAYING THIS IS EXPLICITLY INTENDED TO,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00008,ROBOTS OUT IN THE FIELD THAT ARE AUTONOMOUS THEY'LL MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHO TO SHOOT AND WHO NOT TO SHOOT WITHOUT A HUMAN IN THE LOOP SO THE SUGGESTION IS IF WE'RE GOING TO SEND ROBOTS OUT AND ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS MAYBE IT WOULD BE,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00027,THE WHOLE THEATER FULL OF THE GAS AND IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE DIED BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GAS EACH PERSON IS GOING TO INHALE WHAT POSITION THEY'LL FALL IN WHEN THEY BECOME UNCONSCIOUS AND SO ON,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00035,SHE'S 72 AND IT'S SEEN THAT THIS IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY OF DEALING WITH HER AND,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00007,A RANGE OF OTHER PEOPLE AROUND WHO ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO MIGHT ALSO GET HURT IT'D BE COLLATERAL DAMAGE THAT THE MILITARY OFTEN DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT SO AGAIN THEY'D SAY WITH ACCESS TO NONLETHAL WEAPONS IF WE'VE GOT SOMEONE WE KNOW IS HOSTILE WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO DEAL WITH THEM AND,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00038,I LOOKED AT IT I WAS REALLY SURPRISED APPARENTLY SHE TOOK UP A MORE THREATENING POSITION IN HER BED {LG} I KID YOU NOT THAT'S,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00037_0,FROM IT BECAUSE IN THE SAME DISTRICT,0.000,2.175
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00037_1,POLICE REVIEW POLICY,2.175,5.300
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00037_2,2ND CHILD SHOCKED BY TASER STUN GUN WITHIN WEEKS SAME POLICE DISTRICT,5.300,10.325
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00037_3,ANOTHER CHILD WITHIN WEEKS OF TASERING THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY JUST IN CASE YOU THINK IT'S ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES,10.325,18.540
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00037_4,IT,18.540,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00023_0,USED,0.000,0.780
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00023_1,TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE SIMPLY PASSIVELY NONCOMPLIANT,0.780,5.200
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00023_2,THIS PERSON IS NOT DOING ANYTHING VIOLENT BUT THEY JUST WON'T DO WHAT WE WANT THEM TO THEY'RE NOT OBEYING THE DIRECTIONS WE'RE GIVING THEM SO WE'LL GIVE THEM A SHOT OF THE OC SPRAY THAT'LL SPEED THEM UP EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT BETTER THAT,5.200,17.670
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00023_3,WAY THIS WAS SOMETHING EXPLICITLY INTRODUCED TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FIREARMS BUT IT'S BEING ROUTINELY USED TO DEAL WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER SORTS OF PROBLEMS,17.670,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00033,I CONFESS THIS PARTICULAR CASE WAS ONE THAT PIQUED MY INTEREST IN THIS IT HAPPENED WHILE I,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00001_0,TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE MILITARY OF THE WESTERN WORLD,0.000,5.900
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00001_1,AUSTRALIA UNITED STATES THE UK AND SO ON FACE IN SOME OF THE DEPLOYMENTS THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH IN THE MODERN WORLD AT THIS TIME,5.900,14.065
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00001_2,IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SORTS OF THINGS WE'VE SENT AUSTRALIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL TO IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE GOT OBVIOUS THINGS LIKE IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT THINGS LIKE EAST TIMOR AND THE SOLOMON ISLANDS AND SO ON,14.065,26.195
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00001_3,AND A LOT OF THESE DEPLOYMENTS THAT WE'RE SENDING MILITARY PERSONNEL TO THESE DAYS,26.195,30.865
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00001_4,AREN'T TRADITIONAL WARS,30.865,33.020
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00001_5,IN FACT A LOT OF THE JOBS WE'RE,33.020,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00042,TO USE IT PEOPLE GOING TO COMPLY WITH IT BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LEAVE ANY LASTING EFFECTS,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00026_0,OF THE THEATER THEY WERE HOLDING SOMETHING LIKE 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE THEY'D RELEASED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BUT THEY STILL HAD ABOUT 700 PEOPLE HOSTAGE,0.000,7.375
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00026_1,AND THE RUSSIAN MILITARY POLICE SPECIAL FORCES SPETSNAZ CAME IN AND STORMED THE THEATER THE WAY THEY DID IT WAS TO PUMP THE WHOLE THING FULL OF ANESTHETIC GAS,7.375,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00032,THERE'S A WHOLE HEAP OF PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY TAUGHT TO USE NONLETHAL,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_0,TO TRAIN POLICE POLICE PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN JURISDICTIONS AT LEAST ARE TRAINED,0.000,4.690
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_1,TO DE ESCALATE FORCE,4.690,7.205
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_2,TO TRY AND AVOID USING FORCE WHEREVER POSSIBLE,7.205,10.255
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_3,AND TO USE LETHAL FORCE ONLY AS AN ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT,10.255,15.280
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_4,MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE BEING TRAINED FOR WAR,15.280,18.465
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_5,SO THEY'RE TRAINED THAT AS SOON AS THINGS GO BAD,18.465,21.790
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_6,THEIR FIRST RESPONSE IS LETHAL FORCE,21.790,24.845
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_7,THE MOMENT THE FECAL MATTER HITS THE ROTATING TURBINE,24.845,29.140
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_8,YOU CAN START SHOOTING AT PEOPLE,29.140,32.335
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00014_9,SO THEIR ATTITUDES TO THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE ARE VERY DIFFERENT,32.335,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00039,WHAT IT SAID SHE TOOK UP A MORE THREATENING POSITION IN HER BED,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00040,OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS SO WHY IS THIS RELEVANT BECAUSE POLICE ARE ACTUALLY MORE RESTRAINED IN THE USE OF FORCE THAN THE MILITARY ARE THEY'RE TRAINED TO BE MORE RESTRAINED IN THE USE OF FORCE THAN THE MILITARY ARE THEY'RE TRAINED TO THINK MORE TO TRY AND DE ESCALATE,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00030_0,PROBLEM THEY TALKED ABOUT THAT IT MIGHT BE USED INDISCRIMINATELY A SECOND PROBLEM PEOPLE SOMETIMES TALK ABOUT WITH MILITARY USE OF NONLETHAL WEAPONS AND IT'S ACTUALLY WHY IN THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT YOU CAN'T USE RIOT CONTROL AGENTS AS WEAPONS OF,0.000,14.490
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00030_1,WARFARE IS THAT IT'S SEEN THAT SOMETIMES NONLETHAL WEAPONS MIGHT BE USED NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO LETHAL FORCE BUT AS A LETHAL FORCE MULTIPLIER,14.490,24.165
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00030_2,THAT YOU USE NONLETHAL WEAPONS FIRST SO YOUR LETHAL WEAPONS WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE,24.165,29.650
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00030_3,THE PEOPLE YOU'LL BE SHOOTING AT WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY THEY WON'T BE AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU CAN KILL THEM BETTER,29.650,35.990
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00030_4,AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE,35.990,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00004,THINGS AND THERE'S A RANGE OF PLACES YOU'D THINK THOSE THINGS WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00020,BEFORE BUT THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY QUEENSLAND ANYONE KNOW WHERE THAT WAS,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00017_0,CAPSICUM SPRAY PEPPER SPRAY,0.000,1.725
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00017_1,BY AUSTRALIAN POLICE AND SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN THAT HAD BEEN INTRODUCED AND THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES,1.725,7.865
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00017_2,AND ONE STUDY THAT I FOUND A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ONE WAS IN QUEENSLAND,7.865,12.940
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00017_3,BECAUSE THEY HAD A TRIAL PERIOD FOR THE USE OF PEPPER SPRAY BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY INTRODUCED IT MORE BROADLY,12.940,19.310
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00017_4,AND I,19.310,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00034,HE WAS PROBABLY SIX INCHES TALLER THAN ME AND SHE WAS ABOUT THIS TALL AND EVENTUALLY SHE SAID TO HIM WELL I'M GOING TO GET BACK IN MY CAR AND HE SAYS IF YOU GET BACK IN YOUR CAR I'M GOING TO TASE YOU AND SHE,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00028,OF PEOPLE WHO GOT SHOT IN THIS EPISODE SO WHEN THEY HAD A LOOK AT IT AFTERWARD THERE WERE ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO'D APPARENTLY BEEN,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00041,THESE PROBLEMS WITH POLICE OFFICERS WITH NONLETHAL WEAPONS WHAT ON EARTH WOULD MAKE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER WITH MILITARY PERSONNEL,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00025,ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE WHERE I THINK THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHERE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT WAS THE DUBROVKA THEATER SIEGE IN MOSCOW IN,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00019,INSTEAD OF A FIREARM IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD TO SHOOT SOMEONE,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00009,IF THEY WERE ARMED WITH NONLETHAL WEAPONS SO IF THE ROBOT MAKES A BAD DECISION AND SHOOTS THE WRONG PERSON AGAIN THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY KILLED THEM,0.000,-1.000
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00003_0,DIFFERENTLY FOR NOW THERE'S A BUNCH OF REASONS WHY WE SEND MILITARY PERSONNEL RATHER THAN POLICE TO DO THESE JOBS IF AUSTRALIA HAD TO SEND 1000 PEOPLE TOMORROW TO WEST PAPUA FOR EXAMPLE,0.000,12.160
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00003_1,WE DON'T HAVE 1000 POLICE OFFICERS HANGING AROUND THAT COULD GO TOMORROW AND WE DO HAVE 1000 SOLDIERS THAT COULD GO,12.160,18.490
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00003_2,SO WHEN WE HAVE TO SEND SOMEONE WE SEND THE MILITARY THEY'RE THERE THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND HECK THEY'RE USED TO GOING OFF AND DOING THESE THINGS AND LIVING BY THEMSELVES AND NOT HAVING ALL THIS EXTRA SUPPORT,18.490,28.605
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00003_3,SO THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT IN THAT SENSE,28.605,31.550
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00003_4,BUT THEY AREN'T TRAINED THE SAME WAY POLICE OFFICERS ARE AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT EQUIPPED THE WAY POLICE OFFICERS ARE SO THIS HAS RAISED BUNCH OF PROBLEMS FOR THEM WHEN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES,31.550,41.020
GIt6Z0k3PQo/00003_5,ONE PARTICULAR THING THAT'S COME UP THAT I AM ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WHEN WE'RE SENDING MILITARY PERSONNEL TO DO THESE SORTS OF JOBS WE OUGHT TO BE EQUIPPING THEM DIFFERENTLY AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER WE OUGHT TO BE GIVING,41.020,-1.000
eDFrlV106iM/00002,A DRINK IN FRONT OF ME WITH THIS NAPKIN UNDER IT AND THIS STRAW IN IT,0.000,-1.000
eDFrlV106iM/00006,WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH THIS MASSIVE ISSUE WHERE CAUSE AND EFFECT ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATED IF YOU LIVE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD LIKE I DO YOU'RE PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO SEE THE WHOLE IMPACT THAT YOUR LIFESTYLE ACTUALLY,0.000,-1.000
eDFrlV106iM/00011_0,THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS THE RESOURCES USED TO MAKE IT OR THE WRAPPING AT THE STORE OR THE EXTRACTION OF THOSE RESOURCES,0.000,6.645
eDFrlV106iM/00011_1,AND THE ENERGY USED TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS,6.645,9.575
eDFrlV106iM/00011_2,FOR EVERY POUND OF TRASH WE CREATE SEVEN POUNDS ARE CREATED UPSTREAM,9.575,14.840
eDFrlV106iM/00011_3,NOW ALL OF THIS IS A REAL DOWNER I'M SORRY,14.840,17.950
eDFrlV106iM/00011_4,BUT IT REPRESENTS A CHOICE RIGHT,17.950,21.575
eDFrlV106iM/00011_5,THAT'S THE FLIP SIDE,21.575,23.310
eDFrlV106iM/00011_6,WITH EVERY,23.310,-1.000
eDFrlV106iM/00010,SO WHAT WE NEED IS NOT THE NEXT EASY FIX WE NEED SOMETHING MANAGEABLY HARD THAT HAS A REAL IMPACT THAT'S WHERE TRASH COMES IN SUPER HANDY BECAUSE FOR EVERY,0.000,-1.000
eDFrlV106iM/00005_0,WHAT,0.000,1.095
eDFrlV106iM/00005_1,I STARTED TO REALIZE WAS THAT BY LIVING WITHOUT TRASH,1.095,5.835
eDFrlV106iM/00005_2,I HAD TO ENLIST THE HELP OF EVERYONE AROUND ME,5.835,8.775
eDFrlV106iM/00005_3,MY PROFESSORS HAD TO AGREE TO LET ME SEND THEM HOMEWORK VIA EMAIL,8.775,13.120
eDFrlV106iM/00005_4,MY WAIT STAFF HAD TO REMEMBER NOT TO PUT THE STRAW IN THE WATER,13.120,17.875
eDFrlV106iM/00005_5,AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE ME COME OFF AS TOTAL SNOB,17.875,21.990
eDFrlV106iM/00005_6,BUT,21.990,22.890
eDFrlV106iM/00005_7,WHAT I QUICKLY REALIZED WAS THAT,22.890,24.885
eDFrlV106iM/00005_8,IF YOU JUST CHECK YOUR EGO,24.885,26.995
eDFrlV106iM/00005_9,AND UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS A LITTLE BIT RIDICULOUS,26.995,32.355
eDFrlV106iM/00005_10,IT QUICKLY BECOMES A TEAM EFFORT,32.355,34.375
eDFrlV106iM/00005_11,RATHER THAN AN IMPOSITION OF MY VALUES ON SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE,34.375,38.545
eDFrlV106iM/00005_12,THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS THAT,38.545,42.295
eDFrlV106iM/00005_13,WHEN ONCE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AN ACCOMPLICE TO AN ACT OF TRASHLESSNESS,42.295,46.350
eDFrlV106iM/00005_14,THEY START TO THINK ABOUT THEIR OWN IMPACT,46.350,48.650
eDFrlV106iM/00005_15,OR YOU GET TEXTS WEEKS AFTER HAVING A MEAL WITH SOMEONE OF SOMEONE IS SAYING HEY SAM,48.650,55.260
eDFrlV106iM/00005_16,WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT TOILET PAPER,55.260,57.560
eDFrlV106iM/00005_17,OR I'LL GET A SNAPSHOT OF A NAPKIN THAT SOMEONE DIDN'T USE,57.560,61.135
eDFrlV106iM/00005_18,AND BY THE WAY WE STILL USE TOILET PAPER DON'T WORRY,61.135,65.555
eDFrlV106iM/00005_19,THIS,65.555,67.690
eDFrlV106iM/00005_20,ASPECT OF GOING ZERO WASTE THAT FORCES CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT,67.690,73.415

eDFrlV106iM/00012_3,AND WE CAN OPT OUT,6.335,8.360
eDFrlV106iM/00012_4,THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE IS WON AND LOST BILLIONS OF TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY IN EACH OF OUR CHOICES,8.360,16.295
eDFrlV106iM/00012_5,THIS REALIZATION WAS CRUCIAL FOR MY SISTER AND ME BECAUSE,16.295,20.620
eDFrlV106iM/00012_6,EVEN THOUGH WE FELT GREAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING A ZERO WASTE YEAR,20.620,25.175
eDFrlV106iM/00012_7,IN REALITY WE WEREN'T HAVING THAT MUCH OF AN IMPACT RIGHT,25.175,28.385
eDFrlV106iM/00012_8,BECAUSE THE TWO OF US DOING IT FOR A YEAR IS ABOUT 20000 POUNDS OF WASTE,28.385,32.700

eDFrlV106iM/00016_5,MY,15.840,-1.000
eDFrlV106iM/00015_0,THAT GOING WASTE FREE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A SACRIFICE IN CERTAIN WAYS,0.000,4.575

e8JK3qVGuUg/00034_3,THAT THERE WILL BE A CIRCLE ON THE SKY THAT I SEE OVER HERE,7.385,11.935

hscdmpKGqrQ/00010_0,I HAVE ASKED MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THIS QUESTION OVER THE YEARS AND TYPICALLY WE GET VERY SIMILAR LISTS OF NAMES WHO DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE EXEMPLARY IN THIS DOMAIN OF SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCE YOU MIGHT CALL THEM SPIRITUAL LEADERS AND CERTAIN RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL TEACHERS CONSISTENTLY POP UP THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST HERE INCLUDING JESUS AND BUDDHA,0.000,19.790

hscdmpKGqrQ/00016,FROM WE'RE ALL IRRITATED AND ANNOYED WITH EACH OTHER YOU MIGHT FIND THAT OTHER PEOPLE MAKE YOU REALLY HOSTILE OR ANGRY SO THE MOVE IS FROM ANTIPATHY TO APATHY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A STEP FORWARD,0.000,-1.000
hscdmpKGqrQ/00024,GIFT OF THIS APPROACH IS THESE GENERIC TERMS OF EGO SELF AND HIGHER SELF BECAUSE THEN WE CAN USE SYNONYMS TO HELP PEOPLE BRIDGE TO CONNECT THEIR FAITH TRADITION OR THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM TO THESE MORE GENERIC LARGER TERMS,0.000,-1.000

eHlu6ViSwxo/00002_2,WELL NO BY THE TIME THAT THE DRESS STOPS SPREADING,8.065,11.350
eHlu6ViSwxo/00002_3,NOT EVERYBODY HAS SEEN IT,11.350,13.330
eHlu6ViSwxo/00002_4,THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER SHARING THE DRESS NEVER QUITE REACHES BACK UP TO A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION,13.330,19.525
eHlu6ViSwxo/00002_5,IT STOPS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SHARING THE DRESS CAN'T FIND ANY NEW PEOPLE TO SHARE IT WITH,19.525,24.535

eHlu6ViSwxo/00005_0,SO INCREASING COMPUTATIONAL POWER THOUGH HAS MEANT THAT THE PROCESS OF MATHEMATICALLY MODELING INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAS GOT MUCH MUCH FASTER AND WE CAN NOW ADD A LOT MORE DATA INTO MODELS TO TRY AND BUILD MATCH WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN A POPULATION,0.000,16.075

eHlu6ViSwxo/00005_2,WITH RAPID ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WE ARE SEEING A RAPID EVOLUTION IN THE FIELD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELLING,19.015,26.795

eHlu6ViSwxo/00001_2,WITH OVER TEN MILLION TWEETS IN THE FIRST WEEK THIS IS AN EXTREME CASE OF GOING VIRAL,14.885,21.265
eHlu6ViSwxo/00001_3,SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEDRESS SPREADS THROUGH A POPULATION,21.265,-1.000
eHlu6ViSwxo/00004_0,WHAT WE ARE DOING AS WELL IS ASSUMING THAT EVERYBODY IN THESE GROUPS HAS IDENTICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIORS,0.000,7.165
eHlu6ViSwxo/00004_1,AND NOT MANY DISEASES OR POPULATIONS BEHAVE QUITE SO SIMPLY SO WE OFTEN HAVE TO ALLOW FOR NEW MEMBERS TO JOIN THE POPULATION,7.165,15.765
eHlu6ViSwxo/00004_2,OR FOR OLD MEMBERS TO LEAVE,15.765,18.445
eHlu6ViSwxo/00004_3,OR WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT FOR SOME DISEASES JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD THEM IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM AGAIN,18.445,24.945
eHlu6ViSwxo/00004_4,AND WE NEED TO ADD IN VACCINATION AND TREATMENT FOR SOME DISEASES AS WELL IF WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY SPREAD THROUGH A POPULATION,24.945,31.995
eHlu6ViSwxo/00004_5,SO WE CAN RUN VIRTUAL EXPERIMENTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE HOW MANY CASES COULD WE PREVENT IF WE HAD AN EFFECTIVE VACCINE AGAINST EBOLA FOR EXAMPLE,31.995,-1.000

eHlu6ViSwxo/00003_3,SO WHILE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP A MEME SUCH AS THEDRESS FROM SPREADING ONCE IT STARTS GOING WE'VE GOT AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS WITH WHICH TO FIGHT INFECTIOUS DISEASES,13.200,24.060

IshrD4mjnNU/00015_8,WE CAN SPEAK UP ABOUT CONSENT AND TRY TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE NORMALIZED ASSUMPTIONS WE CAN SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED TO FEEL ABLE TO REPORT IT IF THEY WANT TO,56.915,66.720
IshrD4mjnNU/00015_9,WE CAN ALL PLAY A PART IN INFLUENCING THESE SOCIAL NORMS AND THE CULTURE AROUND US NOT LETTING THE SMALL STUFF SLIDE BECAUSE IT'S THOSE MINOR INCIDENTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SAME ATTITUDES ABOUT WOMEN THAT LEAD TO THE BIGGER ISSUES HAPPENING,66.720,80.700
IshrD4mjnNU/00015_10,CALLING WOMEN SLUTS AND SLAGS GIVING THEM MARKS OUT OF TEN DEHUMANIZES THEM JOKING ABOUT RAPE AND ASSAULT NORMALIZES IT SO WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP AND OUR VOICES ARE LOUDEST WHEN WE RAISE THEM TOGETHER THANK,80.700,91.835

IshrD4mjnNU/00004_4,WE HAD TO COME UP WITH SLUT NAME WHICH THE OLDER STUDENTS ENCOURAGED US TO WRITE ACROSS OUR BREASTS,16.455,21.810
IshrD4mjnNU/00004_5,UPON ARRIVING AT EACH BAR AN OLDER STUDENT WOULD SHOUT OUT A WORD WHICH WAS CODE FOR US TO EITHER FLASH OUR TITS OR OUR ARSE OR DANCE IN A SEDUCTIVE WAY IN FRONT OF THE MEN IN THE PUB,21.810,32.635
IshrD4mjnNU/00004_6,I DIDN'T TAKE PART IN THIS AND DIDN'T WANT TO ADOPT SLUT NAME I WAS TOLD I WAS BEING TOO UPTIGHT AND NOT GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT OF FRESHERS WEEK,32.635,40.435
IshrD4mjnNU/00004_7,THE WHOLE THING CULMINATED IN THE GIRLS AND GUYS MEETING UP IN THE STUDENT UNION WHERE WE WERE INFORMED THE OLDER STUDENTS HAD ORGANIZED A COMPETITION WITH PRIZES,40.435,48.340
IshrD4mjnNU/00004_8,ONE PRIZE WAS FOR THE SLUT' WHO COLLECTED THE MOST TIES FROM THE GUYS THE OTHER WAS FOR THE LAD WHO COLLECTED THE MOST BRAS FROM THE SLUTS I WALKED OUT ON A SCENE OF GROUPS OF DRUNK MALE STUDENTS FORCEFULLY TAKING OFF FEMALE STUDENT'S BRAS,48.340,62.540

IshrD4mjnNU/00009_2,AND MOST PERPETRATORS WERE STUDENTS,9.335,12.315
IshrD4mjnNU/00009_3,IT MATTERS MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE ONLY FOUR PERCENT OF THE FEMALE STUDENTS WHO WERE SERIOUSLY SEXUALLY ASSAULTED REPORTED IT TO THEIR ACADEMIC INSTITUTION AND ONLY TEN PERCENT FELT ABLE TO REPORT IT TO THE POLICE,12.315,25.170
IshrD4mjnNU/00009_4,WHEN THEY WERE GIVING THEIR REASONS FOR THESE LOW REPORTING RATES THEY WERE ASKED WHY DIDN'T YOU FEEL ABLE TO REPORT WHAT HAPPENED,25.170,31.705
IshrD4mjnNU/00009_5,FIFTY PERCENT SAID THEY DIDN'T REPORT IT BECAUSE THEY WERE ASHAMED OR EMBARRASSED AND 43 PERCENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE BLAMED FOR WHAT HAPPENED,31.705,41.225
IshrD4mjnNU/00009_6,SUDDENLY IMPORTANTLY THIS IS WHERE WE COME BACK TO THE FRESHERS WEEK JOKES AND THE INITIATIONS THE SLAG SLUT HOE SLAPPER LABELS THE PRESSURE ON FEMALE STUDENTS TO DRESS IN A CERTAIN WAY OFTEN BY UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED NIGHTS IDEAS THEY'RE PRESSURIZED TO PERPETUATE THE BANTEROUS GAMES ABOUT CHASING FEMALE STUDENTS DOWN HUNTING THEM STRIPPING THEIR BRAS,41.225,-1.000

IshrD4mjnNU/00003_1,THE MESSAGES WE RECEIVED WERE SUGGESTING THAT THIS CREATED A REALLY SERIOUS SENSE OF PRESSURE FOR YOUNG WOMEN TO DRESS IN A CERTAIN WAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS WAS NOT ABOUT A KIND OF PRUDISH MORALITY BAN IT WASN'T SAYING WOMEN SHOULDN'T DRESS IN THAT WAY IF THEY WANTED TO,20.120,34.650
IshrD4mjnNU/00003_2,BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE A REQUIREMENT IT FELT LIKE FANCY DRESS FOR THE BOYS MEANT SOMETHING FUN MEANT DRESSING UP IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS BUT EVERY TIME FOR THE GIRLS THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR VERY NARROW REQUIREMENT OF HOW THEY WERE EXPECTED TO DRESS IT STARTED TO FEEL LIKE IT WAS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST A BIT OF FUN AND MORE LIKE A KIND OF SEXUAL PRESSURE,34.650,-1.000

be03wdS5Klc/00002_1,THERE WAS A WEEK THAT WAS UNUSUALLY STRESSFUL AND I WASN'T GETTING VERY MUCH SLEEP,1.845,6.350
be03wdS5Klc/00002_2,I STARTED TO DEVELOPING A SKIN RASH ON MY HANDS AND MY ELBOWS,6.350,9.910
be03wdS5Klc/00002_3,MY DERMATOLOGIST EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO MY LACK OF SLEEP,9.910,14.005

be03wdS5Klc/00006_2,I STILL HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS WHY DO WE NEED SLEEP,7.630,11.535
be03wdS5Klc/00006_3,HOW DO WE GET RID OF ALLERGIES,11.535,13.435

Df2JBnql8lc/00002,ATTENTION GOES THE REST OF THE BRAIN FOLLOWS IN SOME SENSE IT'S YOUR BRAIN'S BOSS AND OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS I'VE BEEN STUDYING THE HUMAN BRAIN'S ATTENTION SYSTEM IN ALL OF OUR STUDIES,0.000,-1.000

Df2JBnql8lc/00006_1,HIS MIND WAS WORRIED AND PREOCCUPIED AND HAD STRESSFUL MEMORIES AND REALLY DREAD FOR HIS FUTURE AND I'M REALLY GLAD,7.290,16.055
Df2JBnql8lc/00006_2,THAT HE DIDN'T TAKE HIS LIFE,16.055,18.365
Df2JBnql8lc/00006_3,BECAUSE HE AS LEADER KNEW THAT HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS PROBABLY SUFFERING MANY OF HIS FELLOW MARINES PROBABLY WERE TOO,18.365,-1.000
Df2JBnql8lc/00022,IT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES WE MAKE ERRORS WE MISS CRITICAL INFORMATION SOMETIMES AND WE HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING DECISIONS WHAT'S WORSE IS WHEN WE EXPERIENCE STRESS,0.000,-1.000

Df2JBnql8lc/00012,WE'LL ASK THEM TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACE AND TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING THAT WE ASK THEM TO TELL US BY PRESSING A BUTTON IF THE FACE APPEARED TO BE MALE FEMALE ON OTHER TRIALS WE ASK THEM TO TELL US WHAT THE SCENE WAS WAS IT INDOOR OR OUTDOOR,0.000,-1.000
Df2JBnql8lc/00016_0,PRETTY SOON WE COULD TELL THEY WERE SUCCESSFULLY MIND WANDERING BECAUSE THEY'D PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN THAT FACE WAS UPSIDE DOWN EVEN THOUGH IT'S QUITE PLAIN TO SEE THAT IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN,0.000,8.415
Df2JBnql8lc/00016_1,SO WE WANTED TO KNOW HERE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MIND WANDERING,8.415,12.015

Df2JBnql8lc/00016_3,VERY SIMILAR TO,14.295,-1.000

Df2JBnql8lc/00013,PERCEPTION MAYBE IT WORKS LIKE AN AMPLIFIER AND WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS THAT WHEN WE DIRECT ATTENTION TO THE FACE,0.000,-1.000
Df2JBnql8lc/00018_0,IT'S ALSO FRAGILE AND VULNERABLE,0.000,2.250
Df2JBnql8lc/00018_1,AND THINGS LIKE STRESS AND MIND WANDERING DIMINISH ITS POWER,2.250,6.350

Df2JBnql8lc/00025_0,MIND WANDERING'S HAPPENING A LOT,0.000,1.850
Df2JBnql8lc/00025_1,OFTEN IT HAPPENS WITHOUT OUR AWARENESS,1.850,4.590
Df2JBnql8lc/00025_2,AND UNDER STRESS IT'S EVEN WORSE WE MIND WANDER MORE POWERFULLY AND MORE OFTEN IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY DO ABOUT THIS,4.590,12.125
Df2JBnql8lc/00025_3,AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THE ANSWER IS YES,12.125,15.010
Df2JBnql8lc/00025_4,FROM OUR WORK WE'RE LEARNING THAT THE OPPOSITE OF A STRESSED AND WANDERING MIND,15.010,-1.000
Df2JBnql8lc/00019_0,BUT A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE SUGGESTS,0.000,2.760
Df2JBnql8lc/00019_1,THAT WE MIND WANDER WE TAKE OUR MIND AWAY FROM THE TASK AT HAND ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF OUR WAKING MOMENTS,2.760,9.700
Df2JBnql8lc/00019_2,THESE MIGHT BE SMALL LITTLE TRIPS THAT WE TAKE AWAY PRIVATE THOUGHTS THAT WE HAVE,9.700,14.580
Df2JBnql8lc/00019_3,AND WHEN THIS MIND WANDERING HAPPENS,14.580,17.450
Df2JBnql8lc/00019_4,IT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC NOW I DON'T THINK,17.450,-1.000
Df2JBnql8lc/00009,AND THEY DO IT WITH MILLISECOND TEMPORAL PRECISION,0.000,-1.000

JmCtZzSRztQ/00006_0,BUT IT IS A FUNDAMENTALIST CHURCH THAT BELIEVES IN THE LITERAL TRUTH OF THE BIBLE,0.000,5.935

JmCtZzSRztQ/00013_6,AND THEN I HAD THE GOD BRAIN,24.685,26.715
JmCtZzSRztQ/00013_7,THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP IT WAS THIS CLEAN NICE VERSION OF MYSELF,26.715,-1.000

JmCtZzSRztQ/00008_2,LITERALLY,6.350,7.605
JmCtZzSRztQ/00008_3,AND SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE KINDS OF COMPLICATIONS THAT THIS BROUGHT ON,7.605,13.465
JmCtZzSRztQ/00008_4,BUT LUCKILY THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A FULLY ORDAINED PREACHER TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME,13.465,20.105
JmCtZzSRztQ/00008_5,SO MY MOTHER AND I IN OUR SCHEMING,20.105,22.875
JmCtZzSRztQ/00008_6,DECIDED OK HOW ARE WE GOING TO TELL HIM LIKE WE'VE GOT TO WAIT A LONG TIME UNTIL IT'S THE EXACT RIGHT MOMENT AND IT TURNS OUT THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT A RIGHT MOMENT FOR THIS SORT,22.875,33.745

JmCtZzSRztQ/00001,DISCLAIMER IT IS OK FOR YOU TO LAUGH DURING ANY POINT OF THIS PRESENTATION YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY SOON SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A,0.000,-1.000
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_0,ME TELL A FEW THINGS THAT THEY DID ON THE FIRST DAY,0.000,3.440

JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_2,THEY GO THROUGH YOUR POCKETS,6.320,8.365
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_3,YOUR PHONE ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU TO THE CAMP,8.365,13.610
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_4,THEY LOOK FOR WHAT'S CALLED FALSE IMAGES,13.610,16.710
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_5,SO A FALSE IMAGE IS ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO STOP YOU FROM BECOMING COMPLETELY STRAIGHT,16.710,22.875
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_6,SO I'D WRITTEN A SHORT STORY IN ONE OF MY NOTEBOOKS AND I THOUGHT LIKE WHY WOULDN'T I BRING THIS SHORT STORY TO THE CAMP IT'LL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO WHEN I'M BORED RIGHT IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS A FALSE IMAGE,22.875,35.725
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_7,SO THEY RIPPED THE PAGES OUT,35.725,38.780
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_8,OF MY NOTEBOOK WADDED IT INTO A BALL AND THREW IT IN A TRASH,38.780,42.765
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_9,CAN,42.765,44.160
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_10,AND IN THAT MOMENT I BEGAN TO HAVE THE FIRST OF MANY DOUBTS,44.160,49.105
JmCtZzSRztQ/00014_11,SO,49.105,-1.000
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_0,MY FATHER BECAME A MISSIONARY BAPTIST PREACHER,0.000,3.400
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_1,ON THAT DAY MY MOTHER AND I WERE IN CHURCH,3.400,7.345
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_2,AND,7.345,8.610
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_3,YOU KNOW IT WAS SORT OF EXPECTED BECAUSE WE HAD GONE TO CHURCH,8.610,11.965
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_4,THREE TIMES WEEK,11.965,13.555
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_5,EVERY WEEK SINCE THE MOMENT THAT I COULD ACTUALLY GO TO CHURCH,13.555,17.755
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_6,AND SO FOR MY FATHER THIS WAS A VERY NATURAL STEP,17.755,21.470
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_7,BUT THERE,21.470,22.935
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_8,WAS SOMETHING THAT MY MOTHER AND I WERE NOT,22.935,25.600
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_9,EXPECTING WHICH WAS THE SIGHT OF HIM WALKING UP THE AISLE AND CRYING AND SHAKING AND ASKING BETWEEN HIS SOBS,25.600,34.185
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_10,FOR GOD TO FORGIVE HIM OF ALL OF HIS SINS SO THAT HE COULD BECOME A FULL TIME PREACHER,34.185,40.435
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_11,AND AS MY MOM AND I HAD TO STAND UP ON THE STAGE,40.435,44.585
JmCtZzSRztQ/00004_12,BESIDE HIM AND RECEIVE ALL THESE HUGS FROM ALL THESE REALLY NICE PEOPLE THAT WERE,44.585,-1.000
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_0,AND THE EX GAY COUNSELORS THAT TRIED TO TURN ME STRAIGHT,0.000,4.575

JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_2,AND THEN SUDDENLY I READ ALL THESE ARTICLES ABOUT THIS MAN,10.860,14.240
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_3,JOHN SMITH WHO HAD RUN THE WHOLE THING WHO WAS APOLOGIZING FOR WHAT HE'D DONE AND BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS,14.240,21.050
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_4,AND IN THAT MOMENT,21.050,22.530
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_5,IT TESTED THE VERY FOUNDATION OF WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE COMPASSION,22.530,27.275
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_6,BECAUSE I WAS JUST LIKE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FORGIVE THIS KIND OF PERSON YOU KNOW,27.275,32.055
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_7,AND I DON'T THINK I FULLY HAVE,32.055,34.310
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_8,BUT WE ARE FACEBOOK FRIENDS,34.310,38.635
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_9,AND IT,38.635,41.300
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_10,ONLY GETS MESSIER BUT I FEEL LIKE,41.300,46.705
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_11,IT'S WITHIN THE MESS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR COMPASSION,46.705,51.820
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_12,YOU KNOW WITHOUT THE MESS MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW MUCH SHE LOVED ME MY FATHER WOULD HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW,51.820,58.720
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_13,HE HAD TO GROW AND HOW MUCH I HAD TO GROW,58.720,61.320
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_14,AND IT'S WITHIN THAT MESS THAT WE REALLY SAW SORT OF BIBLICAL COMPASSION COME ABOUT,61.320,68.085
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_15,AND YOU,68.085,69.550
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_16,KNOW I WANT TO KIND OF EXTEND THAT TO A MORE GENERAL IDEA WHICH IS THAT THE WORLD SEEMS REALLY ABSURD FREQUENTLY LIKE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS,69.550,79.985
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_17,LOOK AT THE BIGGEST HEADLINES EVERY DAY,79.985,83.905
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_18,IT SEEMS REALLY ABSURD AND SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO EVEN GET OUT,83.905,88.105
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_19,OF BED BUT YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A GOD,88.105,91.380
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_20,GOD MADE THIS MESS,91.380,93.595
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_21,AND,93.595,94.835
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_22,WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP TESTING THE LIMITS OF OUR COMPASSION AND KEEP DEVELOPING THAT BECAUSE,94.835,103.890
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_23,YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A HEAVEN NOBODY CLEANS THEIR ROOMS UP THERE,103.890,108.115
JmCtZzSRztQ/00020_24,AND I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHERE IT IS THAT'S WHERE THE MESS IS SO THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT FOR YOU TODAY,108.115,-1.000
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_0,BECAUSE APPARENTLY I HADN'T HAD ENOUGH MALE TO MALE CONTACT IN MY,0.000,5.810
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_1,LIFE,5.810,7.325
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_2,AND SO BECAUSE I'D MISSED OUT ON THAT I'D SOMEHOW STARTED IDOLIZING MEN'S BODIES,7.325,13.465
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_3,THEY HAD ME CONTINUALLY DO WHAT'S CALLED THE MORAL INVENTORY WHICH WAS EXPLAIN ALL OF THE BAD THOUGHTS THAT I EVER HAD IN FRONT OF,13.465,23.175
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_4,THE GROUP ATTACH BIBLE VERSE TO IT AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT,23.175,27.475
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_5,IT,27.475,28.745
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_6,SO,28.745,29.705
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_7,AS THESE WEEKS PASSED YOU,29.705,31.640
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_8,KNOW I WAS SORT OF BUYING IT SORT OF NOT BUYING IT GOING BACK AND FORTH AND IT JUST FELT,31.640,38.285
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_9,AT SOME POINT,38.285,40.150
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_10,LIKE WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO ME WAS THE VERY OPPOSITE OF LOVE REMEMBER THEIR NAME WAS LOVE IN ACTION,40.150,46.745
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_11,AND IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE,46.745,49.070
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_12,THAT,49.070,50.500
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_13,AND I WAS ACTUALLY SITTING ACROSS FROM AN EMPTY CHAIR,50.500,54.395
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_14,BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO IMAGINE MY FATHER SITTING THERE,54.395,59.280
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_15,AND THE COUNSELORS WERE SAYING YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER HAS OBVIOUSLY DAMAGED YOU,59.280,64.825
JmCtZzSRztQ/00017_16,THIS HAS RUINED YOUR LIFE IT'S MADE YOU WHO YOU ARE THIS SINFUL PERSON THEY SAID THE MORE THAT YOU CAN GET,64.825,-1.000
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_0,AND SO WHEN WE GOT IN THE CAR SHE DROVE US OFF WE WERE GOING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SHE SAID ONE THING WHICH WAS,0.000,7.535
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_1,ARE YOU GOING TO KILL YOURSELF,7.535,11.125
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_2,DIRECT AGAIN AND,11.125,14.025
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_3,I,14.025,15.395
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_4,SAID YES BECAUSE,15.395,20.350
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_5,BECAUSE I THOUGHT LIKE THAT'S THE ANSWER THAT'S GOING TO GET ME OUT OF HERE AND ALSO I SORT OF FELT LIKE IT AT THE,20.350,29.675
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_6,TIME,29.675,30.925
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_7,AND SO SHE DECIDED AT THAT MOMENT IT WAS MUCH BETTER TO HAVE A GAY SON THAN A DEAD ONE,30.925,38.545
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_8,AND SO WE WENT BACK AND YOU KNOW,38.545,42.330
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_9,ALL OF THAT HAPPENED,42.330,44.480
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_10,AND I CAN'T TELL YOU EVERY DETAIL,44.480,48.300
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_11,OF WHAT OCCURRED SINCE THEN BECAUSE IT'S VERY CONVOLUTED HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A TOTAL MESS,48.300,56.640
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_12,RIGHT YOU KNOW MY MOTHER AND I TALKED IT OUT WE EVENTUALLY GOT ON GOOD TERMS WITH ONE ANOTHER,56.640,62.785
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_13,MY FATHER AND I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT,62.785,65.270
JmCtZzSRztQ/00019_14,BUT IT'S PRETTY BURIED IN THE PAST FOR US HOWEVER WE EXCHANGE POETRY VOLUMES REGULARLY LIKE I GIVE HIM POETRY AND HE GIVES ME POETRY WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD,65.270,-1.000
JmCtZzSRztQ/00009_0,MOM SAID,0.000,1.240
JmCtZzSRztQ/00009_1,VERY DIRECT,1.240,3.470
JmCtZzSRztQ/00009_2,AND SO IN THAT MOMENT MY FATHER STOOD UP FROM HIS RECLINER AND HE TOOK ME INTO THE BEDROOM CLOSED THE DOOR SAID SIT DOWN,3.470,13.440
JmCtZzSRztQ/00009_3,AND I WAS LIKE OH GOD WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT WAS LITERALLY OH GOD BECAUSE I WAS PRAYING AT THAT MOMENT,13.440,20.670
JmCtZzSRztQ/00009_4,AND SO AT THIS MOMENT MY FATHER SAID THESE WORDS THAT I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE ABLE TO ERASE FROM MY BRAIN,20.670,29.790
JmCtZzSRztQ/00009_5,WHICH WERE YOU KNOW IF I WAS EVER GOING TO BE STRAIGHT HE JUST RUINED THE CHANCES BECAUSE HE SAID,29.790,36.075
JmCtZzSRztQ/00009_6,YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE INSIDE WOMAN,36.075,-1.000
JmCtZzSRztQ/00003,THE BIBLE BUT ENOUGH OF A PRELUDE I'LL LET YOU HEAR FOR YOURSELVES WHEN I WAS,0.000,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00002_0,WE SAW THE FIRST DIALYSIS MACHINE IN 1960 WE SAW A BURMESE,0.000,5.610
eMSonXncSjA/00002_1,ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON USE A PIECE OF IVORY TO REPLACE THE HIP OF AN 83 YEAR,5.610,11.500
eMSonXncSjA/00002_2,OLD BUDDHIST NUN,11.500,13.485
eMSonXncSjA/00002_3,IN 1967 WE SAW THE FIRST HEART TRANSPLANTATION FIRST ARTIFICIAL HEART CAME LATER ARTIFICIAL KNEE YOU,13.485,21.240
eMSonXncSjA/00002_4,NAME,21.240,22.335
eMSonXncSjA/00002_5,IT,22.335,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00006_0,NOW TO SAY FROM SCRATCH IS BIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE THE REAL TISSUE ENGINEERS ARE THE CELLS,0.000,5.985
eMSonXncSjA/00006_1,AND SO AS TISSUE ENGINEERS WE HAVE A BIT OF AN IDENTITY CRISIS BECAUSE THE CELLS THEMSELVES ARE THE ONES DOING ALL THE WORK,5.985,12.400
eMSonXncSjA/00006_2,BECAUSE THERE WAS A SHIFT PHILOSOPHICALLY FROM THE IDEA OF LET'S BUILD A HIP,12.400,17.485
eMSonXncSjA/00006_3,TO,17.485,18.380
eMSonXncSjA/00006_4,LET'S BUILD AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE A FANCY FISH TANK SO TO SPEAK WE CALL THEM BIOREACTORS THAT ALLOW CELLS,18.380,25.240
eMSonXncSjA/00006_5,TO BUILD A PIECE OF BONE THEMSELVES,25.240,27.780
eMSonXncSjA/00006_6,IT'S A VERY INTERESTING PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT AND MAKES WORKING AS A TISSUE ENGINEER REALLY FUN AND,27.780,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00010_0,TO MARKET AND,0.000,1.410
eMSonXncSjA/00010_1,YOU KNOW THE LATER THE DRUGS FAIL IN THIS PROCESS THE MORE EXPENSIVE AND THE MORE POTENTIALLY DAMAGING,1.410,7.770
eMSonXncSjA/00010_2,IT IS BUT WHAT IF WE COULD USE SOME OF THOSE PIECES OF ENGINEERED TISSUE TO SERVE AS SUBSTITUTES,7.770,14.320
eMSonXncSjA/00010_3,WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR ANIMAL TESTING AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR HUMAN TESTING,14.320,20.620
eMSonXncSjA/00010_4,IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO TWO ISSUES ONE IS THAT WE ARE NOT RATS AND I'M FROM NEW YORK SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT,20.620,27.615
eMSonXncSjA/00010_5,BUT WE USE RATS BECAUSE THEY'RE WHOLE ORGANISMS AND THEY GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW DRUGS MIGHT ACT IN THE BODY,27.615,34.615
eMSonXncSjA/00010_6,AND SECONDLY AS EXQUISITELY SIMILAR AS WE ALL ARE TO EACH OTHER THOSE TINY DIFFERENCES IN OUR DNA ACTUALLY MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE WITH HOW WE METABOLIZE DRUGS AND HOW THE DRUGS AFFECT US,34.615,47.515
eMSonXncSjA/00010_7,SO IF WE CAN USE THESE TISSUE ENGINEERED MODELS TO,47.515,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00005,BECAME THIS IDEA OF BODY 3 0 SO WE'VE,0.000,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00012_0,OK SO THAT'S ENGINEERING HEALTHY HUMAN TISSUES BUT WHAT IF WE COULD ENGINEER TISSUES THAT REPLICATE A DISEASED STATE,0.000,6.780
eMSonXncSjA/00012_1,KEVIN,6.780,7.640
eMSonXncSjA/00012_2,EGGAN FROM HARVARD IS DOING JUST THAT TAKING CELLS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE GENES FOR,7.640,13.275
eMSonXncSjA/00012_3,ALS LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE HE'S ABLE TO GROW NEURONS OUT OF THOSE CELLS,13.275,17.500
eMSonXncSjA/00012_4,AND THOSE CELLS ACT IN THE LAB SIMILARLY TO,17.500,21.860
eMSonXncSjA/00012_5,HOW ALS PATIENTS ACT IN,21.860,24.545
eMSonXncSjA/00012_6,REAL LIFE SO IF WE CAN BEGIN TO,24.545,28.165
eMSonXncSjA/00012_7,GROW MORE OF THESE DISEASED TISSUES IN THE LAB WE CAN ALSO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT DISEASE MECHANISMS AND HOPEFULLY DISEASE,28.165,-1.000

eMSonXncSjA/00016_3,HUMAN TISSUE SUBSTITUTES THAT ARE EITHER HEALTHY OR REPRESENTING DISEASED STATES WE CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A MUCH MORE CONCRETE WAY AND WITH MANY DATA POINTS THAN WE EVER COULD BEFORE ABOUT HOW DRUGS WILL AFFECT,8.730,21.950

eMSonXncSjA/00016_5,BEINGS,22.940,24.330
eMSonXncSjA/00016_6,AND THE FACT THAT THIS ALL IS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME THERE'RE SISTER REVOLUTIONS HAPPENING IN MANUFACTURING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT,24.330,33.745
eMSonXncSjA/00016_7,3D PRINTING OPEN HARDWARE OPEN SOFTWARE PLATFORMS NEW COLLABORATION TOOLS,33.745,40.020
eMSonXncSjA/00016_8,THAT IS SO EXCITING TO US AND MAKES FOR EVEN MORE INTERESTING COLLABORATIONS GOING FORWARD,40.020,44.865
eMSonXncSjA/00016_9,AS,44.865,46.030
eMSonXncSjA/00016_10,A RESEARCHER HAVING SO MUCH FUN IN THIS FIELD I INVITE YOU TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT WHERE YOU THINK THE BODY 4 0 IS GOING TO BE,46.030,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00015_0,FORBID ANY OF US GETS THAT PHONE CALL THAT SAYS THAT EITHER YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS CANCER BUT WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW A SPECIFIC DRUG ACTS ON YOUR SPECIFIC CANCER OR ON MY SPECIFIC CANCER KAREN BURG'S LAB IS DOING JUST THAT USING INKJET TECHNOLOGY TO PRINT BREAST CANCER CELLS IN DISH AND COLLABORATORS OF OURS AT TUFTS ARE USING MODELS LIKE THESE WITH TISSUE ENGINEERED BONES TO STUDY HOW CANCER COULD SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE BODY YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THOSE CHIPS WE JUST LOOKED AT ON THE LAST SLIDE,0.000,30.385
eMSonXncSjA/00015_1,COULD BE THE NEXT GENERATION OF THAT WHERE WE HAVE CANCER AND TISSUES CULTURED TOGETHER,30.385,-1.000

eMSonXncSjA/00013_1,GETTING BACK TO THE RAT THE RAT IS A WHOLE ORGANISM AND AS WE KNOW IF I TAKE A MEDICINE FOR MY BLOOD PRESSURE IT AFFECTS NOT ONLY MY VASCULATURE BUT ALSO IT MIGHT AFFECT MY LIVER AN ANTIDEPRESSANT THAT I TAKE MIGHT GET METABOLIZED AND THEN GET STORED IN MY FAT TISSUE,5.840,22.380
eMSonXncSjA/00013_2,WHAT RESEARCHERS ARE STARTING TO DO NOW IS TO ENGINEER MICROSCALE MICROFLUIDIC CULTURES ON WHICH TINY PIECES OF HEART LIVER LUNG GUT ARE ALL ON THE SAME PLATFORM AND SO WE CAN BEGIN TO STUDY THESE INTERACTIONS,22.380,36.365
eMSonXncSjA/00013_3,THIS FIELD IS JUST BEGINNING SO STAY,36.365,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00008,HEART CELLS KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT CELLS DON'T NEED VERY MUCH TO UNDERSTAND AND TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST THEY JUST NEEDED THE RIGHT FOOD THEY NEEDED,0.000,-1.000
eMSonXncSjA/00007,PIECES OF TISSUE AND FORM A FUNCTIONAL HEART OUT OF THAT BUT THAT'S IN THE FUTURE WHAT CAN WE DO NOW WELL THIS IS A VIDEO OF A PIECE OF ENGINEERED TISSUE THAT I ENGINEERED DURING MY PHD,0.000,-1.000
